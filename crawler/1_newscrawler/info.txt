This file contains scrapers to be used for scraping news. It is a scrapy folder, it was not written
from top to down. To use it you first need to write a spider. The rest is executing the code in
the cmd screen or terminal. For more information see:

Rest of the files:

commands: includes sample commands to be written to cmd or terminal screen. It also includes commandgenerator.py that generates commands for different sources.

dataout: is the folder where outputs of scrapy are stored. When finished with scrapy, please cut
the outputs to another file in your computer. The files are too big to be uploaded to GitHub.

sleeper: is independent from scrapy. We use it between two commands to be pasted to terminal. See
sample_commands.txt file in commands folder.
