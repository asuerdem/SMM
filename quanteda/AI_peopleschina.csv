For decades, people have been predicting how the rise of advanced computing and robotic technologies will affect our lives. On one side, there are warnings that robots will displace humans in the economy, destroying livelihoods, especially for low-skill workers. Others look forward to the vast economic opportunities that robots will present, claiming, for example, that they will improve productivity or take on undesirable jobs. The venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who recently joined the debate, falls into the latter camp, asserting that robots will save us from a future of high prices and low wages.
Figuring out which side is right requires, first and foremost, an understanding of the six ways that humans have historically created value: through our legs, our fingers, our mouths, our brains, our smiles and our minds. Our legs and other large muscles move things to where we need them to be, so our fingers can rearrange them into useful patterns. Our brains regulate routine activities, keeping the leg- and finger-work on track. Our mouths - indeed, our words, whether spoken or written - enable us to inform and entertain one another. Our smiles help us to connect with others, ensuring that we pull roughly in the same direction. Finally, our minds - our curiosity and creativity - identify and resolve important and interesting challenges.
Thiel, for his part, refutes the argument - often made by robot doomsayers - that the impact of artificial intelligence and advanced robotics on the labor force will mirror globalization's impact on advanced-country workers. Globalization hurt lower-skill workers in places like the US, as it enabled people from faraway countries to compete for the leg-and-finger positions in the global division of labor. Given that these new competitors demanded lower wages, they were the obvious choice for many companies.
According to Thiel, the key difference between this phenomenon and the rise of robots lies in consumption. Developing-country workers took advantage of the bargaining power that globalization afforded them to gain resources for their own consumption. Computers and robots, by contrast, do not consume anything except electricity, even as they complete leg, finger, and even brain activities faster and more efficiently than humans would.
Here, Thiel offers an example from his experience as CEO of PayPal. Instead of having humans scrutinize every item in every batch of 1,000,000 transactions for indications of fraud, PayPal's computers can approve the obviously legitimate transactions, and pass on the 1,000 or so that could be fraudulent for thoughtful consideration by a human. One worker and a computer system can thus do what PayPal would have had to hire 1,000 workers to do a generation ago. Given that the computer system does not need things like food, that thousand-fold increase in productivity will redound entirely to the benefit of the middle class.
Put another way, globalization lowered the wages of low-skill advanced-country workers because others would perform their jobs more cheaply, and then consume the value that they had created. Computers mean that higher-skill workers - and the lower-skill workers who remain to oversee the large robotic factories and warehouses - can spend their time on more valuable activities, assisted by computers that demand little.
Thiel's argument may be correct. But it is far from airtight.
In fact, Thiel seems to be running into the old diamonds-and-water paradox - water is essential, but costs nothing, whereas diamonds are virtually useless, but extremely expensive - albeit in a sophisticated and subtle way. The paradox exists because, in a market economy, the value of water is set not by the total usefulness of water (infinite) or by the average usefulness of water (very large), but by the marginal value of the last drop of water consumed (very low).
Similarly, the wages and salaries of low- and high-skill workers in the robot-computer economy of the future will not be determined by the (very high) productivity of the one lower-skill worker ensuring that all of the robots are in their places or the one high-skill worker reprogramming the software. Instead, compensation will reflect what workers outside the highly productive computer-robot economy are creating and earning.
The newly industrialized city of Manchester had the highest level of labor productivity the world had ever seen. But the factory workers' wages were set not by their extraordinary productivity, but by what they would earn if they returned to the potato fields of pre-famine Ireland.
So the question is not whether robots and computers will make human labor in the goods, high-tech services, and information-producing sectors infinitely more productive. They will. What really matters is whether the jobs outside of the robot-computer economy - jobs involving people's mouths, smiles, and minds - remain valuable and in high demand.
From 1850 to 1970 or so, rapid technological progress first triggered wage increases in line with productivity gains. Then came the protracted process of income-distribution equalization, as machines, installed to substitute for human legs, and fingers created more jobs in machine-minding, which used human brains and mouths, than it destroyed in sectors requiring routine muscle power or dexterity work. And rising real incomes increased leisure time, thereby boosting demand for smiles and the products of minds.
Will the same occur when machines take over routine brainwork? Maybe. But it is far from being a safe bet on which to rest an entire argument, as Thiel has.

China’s first artificial intelligence assisted treatment center opened in Hefei, the capital of eastern China's Anhui Province on Sunday. It will carry out research to guide machine-learning, such as recognizing messages and using visual neural networks to solve problems.
The center features a voice-based information system, a computer-aided medical image diagnosis system and some other cutting-edge equipment. Studying multitudes of hospital imaging data, and two million real electronic patient cases, the system is expected to improve detection rates.
AI serves not only as a helping hand but also as a competitor for doctors. It takes a doctor about half an hour to scrutinize over 300 medical images, but through the artificial intelligence system, it only takes a few seconds.
The AI-assisted treatment simplifies the process of uploading imaging data, making a prescription, and developing new applications with technological achievements.

Private capital takes role in State giant as it embarks on mixed-ownership reform scheme
China United Network Communications Group Co Ltd, the country's second-largest mobile carrier by subscribers, has agreed to raise a total of 78 billion yuan ($11.7 billion) from strategic investors, as part of the Chinese government's push to rejuvenate State-owned enterprises with private capital.
The strategic investors include Chinese tech heavyweights Tencent Holdings, Baidu Inc, JD.com Inc, Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd, Didi Chuxing, Suning Commerce Group, as well as Chinese car rail manufacturer CRRC Corp and financial insurance enterprise China Life Insurance Co Ltd. Other tech companies such as Yongyou Software Co and Wangsu Science & Technology, and domestic industrial funds also participated in the investment.
""We are the first SOE on the group level to undertake this mixed-ownership reform scheme. It's a historic opportunity for us to introduce well-established strategic investors to explore areas of cooperation with us, in a bid to improve our management structure with diversified shareholders,"" said Wang Xiaochu, CEO of China Unicom Hong Kong.
Wang said China Unicom will cooperate with strategic investors in the areas they specialize in.
""With the domestic IT giants, we will explore cooperative opportunities in retail systems, payment systems and cloud computing. With the industry funds, we will explore business opportunities with their numerous investor companies to create a win-win result.""
Tencent, which invested 11 billion yuan, accounted for 5.18 percent of equity interests in China Unicom's Shanghai-listed arm, Baidu poured in 7 billion yuan, accounting for 3.30 percent, while Alibaba and JD invested 4.3 billion yuan and 5 billion yuan, accounting for 2.04 percent and 2.36 percent, respectively, according to China Unicom.
The company said the mixed-ownership reform proposal was approved by the country's top economic regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the share issue proposal has been approved by the board of China Unicom's listed company.
Furthermore, the Shanghai-listed arm will allot three board seats to private investors, and the mixed-ownership restructuring will be completed by the end of this year.
The investment is part of the government's drive for State behemoths to be revitalized with private capital, with China Unicom among the first batch of State-owned enterprises to see mixed-ownership reform.
""China Unicom is the biggest beneficiary of the mixed-ownership reform, as it could utilize cutting-edge technologies from internet giants, access more channels and potential customers, as well as enhance its telecom service quality through introducing new strategic investors,"" said Peter Liu, research director at consultancy Gartner Inc.
Liu added the telecom carrier will make more efforts in 4G network construction, boosting its broadband penetration rate across the country.
Xiang Ligang, chief executive of telecom industry website Cctime, said China Unicom will cooperate with newly introduced investors in the fields of big data, internet of things, artificial intelligence and cloud computing.
""It is expected that the move will boost China Unicom's 4G user base and improve network infrastructure construction,"" he said.
The telecom operator also said its first-half net profit rose 68.9 percent to 2.42 billion yuan from 1.43 billion yuan a year earlier, while its revenue fell slightly to 138.16 billion yuan from 140.26 billion yuan the previous year.

Based on big data technology, the machine is capable of recording the specific details of certain cultural relics. This can be used to tell fakes from originals.
The startup AITC in Yizhuang Economic and Technology Development area in the suburban Daxing district of Beijing was started in March by Hans Uszkoreit, scientific director at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence.
Uszkoreit said the center would focus on creating an AI service system and big data public technology platform. It will cooperate with companies that need the application of AI technology, such as JD.com, to make breakthrough in the fields of natural language processing and big data analysis.
Professor Uszkoreit and his company epitomize the foreign entrepreneurial rush in Beijing.
Beijing has hoped to attract more ""elite foreigners"" since it eased permanent-residence requirements in 2016. Twenty measures took effect on March 1, 2016, mainly targeting managerial-level professionals, Chinese born abroad, entrepreneurs and recently-graduated foreign students.
Zhongguancun, known in some quarters as ""China's Silicon Valley,"" has offered permanent-residence certificates in China to more than 280 foreigners since 2016.
Jahangir Raza from Pakistan just graduated from North China Electric Power University. He is working in the capital as a service manager for Beijing Aeonmed and is getting his work visa in China.
He expects a lot from his future career, and says he decided to stay in Beijing because of the great opportunities here.
Yang Zhongwei, International Marketing & Sales Director of Beijing Aeonmed, said the company would like to hire overseas staff because they can become the strong link between overseas markets and Chinese companies.
From common entrepreneurs to Nobel laureates, an increasing number of foreigners see Beijing as an ideal place for their business ideas.
THOMAS Beijing Research and Development Center was founded in Beihang University this February. The center named after Professor Thomas C. Sudhof, a winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, was jointly founded by the city of Beijing, Beihang University and Professor Thomas C. Sudhof.
Focusing on repairing central nervous system injuries, the center has a multidisciplinary advantage and undertakes research into many areas, including pathophysiology, biomaterial modification, preparation techniques and repairing neural injuries.
Nils Pihl, a tech CEO in Beijing, born in Sweden, moved to Silicon Valley and then New York, but founded a tech startup in Beijing.
He wrote an article for the Business Insider, an American news website, to explain why he chose Beijing for his startup. Pihl believes Beijing is great for innovation.
""Beijing offered us cheap housing and food, a network of experienced mentors that were happy to take the time to help, steady access to some of the world's greatest engineering talent at a sixth of the cost of a junior engineer in Silicon Valley and access to a vast market of clients,"" he wrote.

The world’s No.1 weiqi (Go) player Ke Jie lost the contest against his artificial intelligence (AI) rival, AlphaGo, in the third and also final match of the summit on Saturday.
This match began at 10:30 BJT in Wuzhen, east China’s Zhejiang Province, with AlphaGo playing the black and Ke white.
Ke showed his brilliant weiqi skills as he said he will “fight till the end,” though he lost his previous two matches against AlphaGo on Tuesday and Thursday.
AlphaGo made the first “impolite” move as it did on Thursday – to put the black stone on the bottom-right corner of the weiqi board. It is a Chinese tradition that the first stone is usually placed around the top-right corner and this is what weiqi coaches always teach beginners.
“I think the black already wins,” said Nie Weiping, vice president of the Chinese Weiqi Association, and a Chinese weiqi legend, one hour after the match.
Just like Ke, Nie thinks AlphaGo is much stronger than any human player.
“I don’t think the match has any meaning because the huge capability gap between the two sides left no doubt who will win,” said Nie. “AlphaGo is a machine. The gap between human player and AlphaGo, for example, is like a race competition, in which we human players are like a bike or car, but AlphaGo is a plane, or even a spacecraft.”
Nie reckoned AlphaGo should be a coach for weiqi players as there is much to learn from the AI program's unusual moves in the three matches.
“I believe AlphaGo should be a coach for our professional weiqi players as a master to improve our weiqi capacity,” he said.
Although Ke fell behind fast in the beginning of the match, he fought hard to catch up with his AI opponent.
The margin became very small when the two players entered the endgame.
Ke and AlphaGo clashed hard on the last empty area on the board – the top edge.
The commentators tried very hard to guess what moves were to be made, but they were left surprised by the two sides.
During the endgame, AlphaGo chose to retreat in all places around the board, giving Ke some territory to keep the situation stable, as the machine was already confident about winning.
But Ke still chose to give up after struggling.
The match lasted over three and a half hours.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Meitu is a global mobile internet platform and innovator in mobile video and photography, including Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithm-based proprietary facial recognition and virtual “try-on” technologies for hair and makeup. By leveraging its technology leadership and global user base, Meitu is building a mobile beauty ecosystem where users can discover, create and share new looks – right from their smartphone. Today, Meitu apps are installed on over 1.1 billion unique mobile devices around the world, with billions of photos generated by Meitu apps each month.
The launch of a new Meitu M8 Mobile Phone this year has added another advantage to the Meitu series of selfie smartphones featuring a revolutionary mix of hardware and cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technology.
“Our mobile phones are second to none in the world. They can easily make use of our 23 products that include a photo-editing application, a short video and live streaming platform and even a mobile gaming application,” company officials told journalists on Thursday.
Meitu application can be operated in 1.1 million mobile devices, including software and hardware products such as Meitu, BeautyCam, BeautyPlus,SelfieCity, MakeupPlus, Meipai, Meitu Phones, and more.
They are not only enabling users to easily beautify images and ingraining the selfie culture in the minds of all, but also enhance a discovery of different self that represents beauty, trendiness and newness.
There are currently 456 million users in China and 500 million users in the rest of the world, including the African Continent, which is a new market where mostly young ladies are waiting for such opportunities to make their looks beautiful at all times. The continent is currently making frantic effort to catch up with the developed world. There are currently hundreds of thousands of Meitu service users in the continent.
Company officials have however assured of rolling out their products and services to the hook and cranny in the world.
To many products and services users, Meitu is here to help especially young ladies to fulfill what Maria Montez, the Queen of Technicolor once said: “When a woman improves her appearance, an amazing thing happens. People begin to pay attention to her, listen to her, seek her company, and ask her opinion. She becomes more confident, and this makes her look even better! As her confidence grows, so does the respect she receives – at work, at home, everywhere. As her insecurity falls away, she becomes more daring, self-assured, courageous; she finds she can do anything. Her life improves in every way.”
In the past five years, China's internet population has soared. There are now over 700 million Chinese web users, about 20 percent of the world's internet users. Meitu has brought about a comparative advantage and solution to most users not only in China but the rest of the world.

It is expected that big data technology will boost global GDP by more than two percent year-on-year through 2020, Bai Chunli, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said during the China International Big Data Industry Expo in Guiyang, Guizhou Province, earlier this year.
""Big data technologies will involve various disciplines and industries. We should establish an international big data innovation organization, working together on setting regulations, research and development and the application of the new technologies,"" Bai said.
In 2016, China's core industry in the big-data sector attained a market value of 16.8 billion yuan (about 2.5 billion US dollars), a 45-percent increase from 2015, according to a recent survey by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology. And the country is expected to grow big data industry sales to one trillion yuan by 2020.

A South Korean Go grandmaster scored his first win over a Google-developed supercomputer on Sunday — a surprise victory after three humiliating defeats in a high-profile showdown between man and machine.
Lee Se-dol thrashed AlphaGo after a nail-biting match that lasted for nearly five hours. It was the fourth of the best-of-five series in which the computer clinched a 3-0 victory on Saturday.
Lee struggled in the early stages of the fourth match but gained a lead toward the end, eventually prompting AlphaGo to resign.
One commentator said Lee's victory was proof that artificial intelligence has not surpassed humans completely, while another said the fourth match revealed AlphaGo’s weakness, which had also been shown in the previous game.
Lee, 33, is one of the greatest players in the modern history of the ancient Chinese game, with 18 international titles to his name — the second most in the world. He earlier predicted a landslide victory over artificial intelligence, but was later forced to concede that AlphaGo was ""too strong"".
After his second defeat, Lee had vowed to try his best to win at least one game.
The best-known artificial intelligence victory to date came in 1997, when the IBM-developed supercomputer Deep Blue beat chess champion Garry Kasparov.
But Go, played for centuries mostly in East Asia, had long remained the holy grail for developers of artificial intelligence due to its complexity and near-infinite number of potential configurations.
AlphaGo uses two sets of deep neural networks that allow it to crunch data in a more humanlike fashion — dumping millions of potential moves that human players would instinctively know were pointless.
Its performances during the games with Lee stunned many Go experts, who described its moves as so unconventional that no human player would ever make them.",'% artificial intelligence%'

China’s supply-side structural reform has scored positive results, Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) told reporters on Monday, citing optimized industrial, investment and consumption structures.
A new economy led by information technology and high-tech industry is just around the corner, said Ning, referencing the thrilling match between South Korean Go master Lee Se-dol and the artificial intelligence AlphaGo as he said that Chinese robot output has already increased by 17 percent in the first two months of this year.
He noted that the output of new energy vehicles also doubled in that same period. At the same time, the production of crude steel dropped by 5.7 percent and output of nonferrous metal also declined by 4.3 percent.
Ning, also a deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, pointed out that the data indicated that China’s economy underwent stable growth in January and February, citing the stable fundamentals in employment, domestic demands and commodity prices.
In the first two months of the year, the registered unemployment rate in 31 major cities stood at about 5.1 percent, lower than that of the same period in last year, said Ning. Fixed-asset investment was up 10.2 percent from a year earlier.
Retail sales, used as a measure of domestic consumption, maintained steady growth of 10.2 percent in the same period, implying that China’s economy now relies more on domestic demands.
The country’s industrial, investment and consumption structures have been optimized, according to the NBS head.
He said that the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, increased by 1.8 percent year-on-year in January and by 2.3 percent in the following month, which still falls short of the goal to ""keep the increase in CPI at around 3 percent"" set in this year’s government work report. Commodity prices demonstrated a stable rise without large fluctuations.
Though industrial growth slowed, growth in the service industry was rapid. It accounted for more than 50 percent of total GDP, further optimizing the economic structure, Ning said.
Hailing a better investment structure, Ning said that China has invested more in the high-tech and infrastructural sectors but less in energy-intensive industries.
Income from tourism saw double-digit growth during the Spring Festival holidays, witnessing a drop in banquet and tourism at the public’s expense but an increase in mass catering and tourism, Ning said, adding that in the first two months, income from the catering sector also soared 11.3 percent from a year earlier.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Lee ""calmly"" responded to AlphaGo's anomalous moves in an early phase, which one commentator regarded as perhaps mistakes, leading the game in his slight favor.
Another commentator said Lee seemed to have regained confidence as he returned to his regular style of playing after exchanging conventional moves with the computer program earlier in the game.
Lee and AlphaGo started the second of the five-game match at about 1 p.m. local time (0400GMT) at Four Seasons hotel in Seoul. The landmark fight between a human and artificial intelligence (AI) will run until next Tuesday.
AlphaGo started off with anomalies. Playing Black, the computer program put its starter at the upper-right flower spot. In turn, Lee also placed his first white stone at a flower.
About one and half minutes later, AlphaGo put the third marker at a position right beside the flower spot, an unconventional move different from the previous day's strategy. AlphaGo placed its first two pieces on the flower spots on Wednesday.
Exchanging conventional moves with each other, AlphaGo put its 13th marker at an anomalous position in the middle of the upper board, which a commentator said was a move he had never seen in the human world of the game.
Another commentator said it may take more than the previous day for the second game to close to an end as the two players are playing in a relative conventional manner.
AlphaGo beat the human Go champion, who has topped the world ranking for most of the past 10 years, during the first face-off of the historic match, which is seen as a representative battle between humans and artificial intelligence.
Lee's loss was seen as a shock as it proves that AI may have surpassed humans in Go, which had been viewed as the last game humans can dominate over machine due to its complex, creative and intuitive nature.
AlphaGo is a computer program developed by Google's London-based AI subsidiary DeepMind. It took the world by surprise after beating European Go champion Fan Hui by 5-0 in October last year.
The AI boasts of a deep learning capability that enables the computer program to discover new strategies by playing games against itself and adjusting neural networks based on a trial-and-error process known as reinforcement learning.
Lee, 33, is seen as one of the greatest Go players in the world as he won 18 world championships for 21 years of his professional career. He recorded a winning rate of about 70 percent with 47 victories in professional matches, while AlphaGo posted a 99.8 percent rate with 504 victories and only one defeat.
Go originated from China more than 2,500 years ago. It involves two players who take turns putting markers on a grid-shaped board to gain more areas on it. One can occupy the markers of the opponent by surrounding the pieces of the other.",'% artificial intelligence%'

With the combination of technical breakthroughs, application domain development and supportive governmental policies, analysts believe that the artificial intelligence market could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars in the future.
Total global investment in the field of artificial intelligence was more than 1.9 billion dollars in 2014, a growth of more than 50 percent from 2013. BBC forecasted that the market will continue its rapid growth. The global market size will reach 18.3 billion dollars (about 119 billion yuan) in 2020.
As of now, there are more than 900 enterprises in the field of artificial intelligence, mainly in North America and Western Europe. Several technology giants such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and IBM have already stepped into the field.
In addition, some domestic enterprises are following the trend. Baidu has come up with the ""Baidu Brain,"" Alibaba launched the first domestic artificial intelligence platform, DTPAI, and Tencent created the robotic copywriter, Dream Writer.
""With the technical support of big data, cloud computing and more, the booming development of artificial intelligence will revolutionize the way we work and live.

After about three and a half hours of play, Lee, one of the greatest players of the ancient board game who has topped the world ranking for most of the past decade, resigned when it became clear the AlphaGo had taken an unassailable lead.
The result is out of the anticipation of many experts. It's expected that Lee will be the winner in the 3,000-year-old Chinese game for many, including Kai-Fu Lee, the former Google vice president, who believed AlphaGo's chance to win is slim.
Playing black in Game One, Lee made the first move of the match being held on the sixth floor of the Four Seasons hotel in Seoul.
The match-up has sparked enough interest to warrant an Internet live-stream as well as live TV broadcasts in South Korea, China and Japan.
The five-game battle for supremacy between human and machine is being seen as a major test of what scientists and engineers have achieved in the sphere of AI over the past 10 years or so.
The most famous AI victory to date came in 1997, when the IBM-developed supercomputer Deep Blue beat the then-world class chess champion Garry Kasparov.
AlphaGo drew the world attention when it crushed European champion Fan Hui in a 5-0 whitewash in January -- the first time a computer program has beaten a professional player of the game, sending shockwaves through the Go community
Played on a board with a 19x19 grid of black lines, Go is such a complex game that enthusiasts hoped it would be years, or perhaps decades, before machines would be able to triumph over the best human players, but now it's evident that AI technology is much advanced than many have assumed.
Lee confessed to some pre-match nerves at a press conference on Tuesday, avoiding to take a high profile stance. ""Now I think I may not beat AlphaGo by such a large margin like 5-0. It's only right that I'm a little nervous about the match,"" Lee said Tuesday.

South Korean Lee Sedol, world Go champion in the past 10 years, and AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google's London-based subsidiary DeepMind, kicked off the first of their five-game match that will run through next Tuesday.
Kim Hyun-jin, wife of Lee Sedol, and their daughter Lee Hye-lim who came to Four Seasons hotel in central Seoul to watch Lee's match, were surrounded by lots of local and foreign journalists at the corner of the hotel while the match is going on.

The match was played at the sixth floor of the hotel, with hundreds of local and foreign journalists gathering at press rooms installed temporarily.
About two hours before the start of the game, about 250 journalists gathered in the hotel to cover it, which is seen by many as a representative match between humans and artificial intelligence (AI).

South Korean Lee Sedol, one of the greatest Go players who has topped the world ranking for most of the past decade, was shockingly beaten by AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google's London-based AI subsidiary DeepMind.
AlphaGo took the world by surprise after beating European Go champion Fan Hui by 5-0 in October last year and even defeated the world champion though four games are left, a result out of widespread expectations among Go experts.
Go enthusiasts had hoped it would take years, or perhaps decades, for AI to triumph over the best human players, but it's now evident that AI technology is much more advanced than many have expected.
The ""match of the century"" drew great attention from across the world, with hundreds of local and foreign journalists from China, South Korea and Japan as well as the United States and European countries gathering at the Four Seasons hotel in central Seoul.
During a press conference in Seoul a day before the opening match, Lee lowered confidence in his victory as AlphaGo seemed to have improved its intuitive power. Go had been viewed as the last game humans can dominate over AI due to its intuitive nature and complexity.
Demis Hassabis, CEO of the DeepMind, told the press conference on Tuesday that AlphaGo has made many upgrades since the game with Fan Hui in October 2015, based on which many experts predicted Lee's sweep victory.
AlphaGo won the opening match, taking a 1-0 lead in the five-game match that will run through next Tuesday. The next game will be held at the same hotel in Seoul from 1 p.m. (0400 GMT).
Lee and AlphaGo played a tight game by the middle of the match, but the 33-year-old resigned when it became clear that the computer program had taken an unassailable lead.
Playing black, Lee put his first position in the right flower spot, and about one and a half minutes later, AlphaGo placed its first marker in the left flower. One of DeepMind developers put AlphaGo's markers on the board, shown through Internet broadcasting, on behalf of the computer program.
From the very beginning, Lee played anomalously by placing his fourth marker at an irregular position, which a commentator said it was the first anomaly he has ever seen from the South Korean Go professional.
AlphaGo responded ""calmly"" to the anomaly, playing aggressively to Lee who in turn took counterattacks against the algorithm, the commentator said.
Lee's slight domination by the middle of the match was reversed as AlphaGo infiltrated into the right areas of black put by the human champion. He tried to change the situations in his favor, but he finally admitted his defeat after his 186th placing.
As Lee got the black which allows his faster starter than AlphaGo, Lee had to win 7.5 areas more than AlphaGo as a handicap for victory, according to Chinese Go rules adopted in the match.
Go originated from China more than 2,500 years ago. It involves two players who take turns putting markers on a grid -shaped board to gain more areas on it. One can occupy the markers of the opponent by surrounding the pieces of the other.
To cover the human versus AI fight, hundreds of journalists gathered at the venue from around the world. The match was broadcast live through TVs in South Korea, China and Japan, with Google's YouTube showing it through an Internet live-stream.
Kim Hyun-jin, wife of Lee Sedol, and their daughter Lee Hye-lim who came to the venue to watch Lee's match, were surrounded by lots of local and foreign journalists at the corner of the hotel for interviews while the match was going on.
At the VIP room, South Korean politicians and senior government officials watched the landmark game, including floor leader of ruling Saenuri Party, head of the main opposition Minju Party, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon and other government officials.
After the announcement of Lee's defeat, people watching the match in and around the venue voiced a sigh over the unexpected loss of the human champion.
Lee has won world Go champions 18 times in the past 11 years, recording a winning rate of about 70 percent with 47 victories in professional matches. AlphaGo has recorded a 99.8 percent winning rate with 504 victories and only one defeat.
With the victory, Google is expected to enjoy great promotional effects from the match of the century, which is also forecast to help Go, known as Weiqi in China and Baduk in South Korea, gain popularity in Western countries as well as in Asia.
The promotion effect is estimated to reach at least 100 million U.S. dollars in consideration of worldwide attention and news media reports from Western countries as well as Asian nations. Google allegedly has invested about 2 million dollars, including 1 million dollars in prize, for the landmark event.
The match drew great attention from news organizations, Go fans and even the general public around the world. With the victory, AlphaGo developer DeepMind could gain reputation as one of the world's leading AI companies.
AlphaGo boasts of its deep learning, a capability of learning to discover new strategies for itself by playing thousands of games between its neural networks and adjusting connections by use of a trial-and-error process known as reinforcement learning.
The world AI market is forecast to grow to nearly 2 trillion dollars by 2025, expanding its application to various fields such as healthcare, disease analysis and even legal advices.
The match between Lee and AlphaGo is also projected to help the Chinese board game gain popularity in Western countries as well as in Asia.

China will put great emphasis on aircraft engines and gas turbines, making those two fields top items on the list of 100 significant projects to be developed during the 13th Five-Year Plan, a Chinese military expert told Global Times.
According to the expert, an advanced engine, to some extent, decides the performance of military aircraft including fighters, and aircraft engines have long been a bottleneck that constrains the development of China's domestically produced military aircraft.
Besides engines, China plans to accelerate the development of large planes. China's first domestically produced large plane, C919, will make its maiden flight in 2016, and is likely to be used for ordinary flights within the 13th Five-Year Plan. Furthermore, China's domestically developed cargo aircraft Y-20 will be put into military use in 2016.

""Automatic driving technology is more complicated than AlphaGo [the computer developed to play the board game Go],"" Wang said. In Wang's eyes, the successful development of artificial intelligence relies on three things: calculating ability, big data and calculation methods. Currently, the company owns hundreds of thousand servers. The calculating ability of the super computer developed by the company is twice of that of Tianhe-1.
Taking advantage of artificial intelligence, Baidu’s driverless cars have already managed successful, fully automatic drives in a variety of road conditions, including urban roads, elevated roadways and expressways.

Driverless cars are the most significant development so far for the company. A spokesperson has said that they hope to put the car into commercial use within three years, and to enter mass production within five years. However, whether the car will put into commercial use depends largely on cost. A car-based radar on the driverless car that finished testing last year cost 700,000 yuan.

While AlphaGo's win over one of the world's best Go players marked a milestone in artificial intelligence advances, humans have an edge in many of the simpler tasks, such as linguistic expression.What does a board game have in common with a pet?
It turns out that Go as a game sounds like the Chinese word for dog (gou) even though the Chinese equivalent is weiqi, or literally the encircling game. That's why for the past week many in China have been inundated by the news that a dog has trumped humans in smartness. It was about the only scintilla of fun in an otherwise grim scenario for the human species.
Most of my countrymen were probably not paying enough attention in 1997, when IBM computer Deep Blue beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in a match. There was not as much coverage here, plus that style of chess, known as international chess, is not widely played in China, while Go is an ancient game invented in China and most popular in Asia.
So, AlphaGo's match with Lee Sedol, which was streamed live on all major online platforms with narration and commentary, came as a big blow to anyone who considers Go to be the ultimate barrier for artificial intelligence in climbing over that of the human.
Before the match started on March 9, Chinese forecasts fell neatly into two camps: Science majors overwhelmingly took the side of the machine while Go specialists believed in the ability of one of their best to come out ahead. Needless to say, the more you pinned your hope on Lee, the more disappointed you got.
I'm not a science major and know nothing about Go. All the sci-fi movies I have seen have conditioned me to accept this as something of a given. Actually they go far beyond defeating humans at board games.
From a layman's perspective, for anything that builds on the foundation of knowledge, humans do not have a chance vis-a-vis a computer, let alone a specially equipped and programmed one. The irony is, the more specific and in-depth the knowledge is, the easier it is for a machine to commit to memory and recall for use.
Games have rules and possibilities, and a machine can outsmart a human because it can tap its storehouse instantly. Sure, Go involves strategizing, which is far more complicated than simply identifying the best out of a million possibilities. But anything that can be streamlined and quantified into a set of rules will leave humans at a disadvantage.
AlphaGo's victory was a milestone in artificial intelligence research, but it's time to move beyond it. As Deep Blue's Murray Campbell said, it marked ""the end of an era ... board games are more or less done"".

Alibaba, China’s largest e-commerce company, is preparing to unveil its first Internet-connected smart car in April, according to a report in People's Daily.
According to the company's chief technology officer Wang Jian, Internet character is one of the car's technological innovations. Details of the sport utility vehicle (SUV) will be unveiled at a launch event in April. Furthermore, this is an energy-saving car whose battery will retain 80 per cent of its storage capacity after running 160,000 kilometers.
Internet cars adopt technologies including computer, modern sensor, information fusion, telecommunication, artificial intelligence and automatic control. The car jointly developed by Alibaba and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) is equipped with real car-based smart operation system which has proprietary intellectual property rights.
Independent development of smart operation system plays a key role in the process to transform an ordinary car to an Internet car. In order to fulfill this task, Alibaba arranged over 800 researchers for this project and invested billions of dollars into the project.
Wang explained that the Internet car will not only promote people-to-car communication, it will expand car-to-car, car-to-road, and car-to-infrastructure communication too.",'% artificial intelligence%'

In 2008, when the global financial crisis first erupted, Dongguan faced a critical moment for future development. The old way of only relying on labor, land and environment was not going to last in the new economic situation; companies in Dongguan began looking for ways to transform.
Supporting the entity economy, carrying out the “Made in China 2025” project, and developing equipment related to artificial intelligence became the main focuses of Dongguan’s government and enterprises.
“We will weed out or transform most of the low-end enterprises and bring in a great number of innovative organizations and high-end projects,” said the Party chief of Dongguan, Xu Jianhua, who was determined to make Dongguan the leader of intelligence manufacturing.
Total transformation is never easy. In 2012, the economic growth rate for the first quarter was only 1.3 percent, and 2.5 percent for the first six months. Xu encouraged local enterprises to be patient.
In 2015, Dongguan’s persistence finally paid off: the economic aggregate of Dongguan reached 100 billion dollars with a growth rate of 8 percent; advanced manufacturing and high-tech manufacturing industries increased by 47 percent and 36 percent while traditional manufacturing dropped to 18.8 percent; Dongguan’s import and export growth rate ranked first among all Chinese cities. Now there are 986 innovative enterprises and 28 innovative research organizations.
Dongguan is emerging with new vitality. After the Nokia plant — which used be seen as Dongguan’s biggest advantage — moved out, over 80 new manufacturing enterprises filled its spot in just a few months. In 2015, Dongguan’s per capital GDP had reached $12,000, rivaling the standard of many moderately developed countries.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Chen reveals that this invention will be put into production some time this year. As a result, new technologies like anti-fraud face-scanning software and picture search will likely be more reliable and easier to use in the near future.
“Deep learning refers to the method of training multi-layer artificial neural networks. Generally speaking, it is the way a computer imitates the human brain to learn, judge and make decisions using deep neural networks. This will remain as a hot research topic in the field of artificial intelligence,” said researcher Yi Jianqiang of CAS.
In 2010, Google used 16,000 processors running for seven days to train a cat in face recognition. More recently, the computer program AlphaGo beat the human Go champion, which required even more processors.
The deep learning processor that CAS has developed is roughly twice as powerful as the processor that AlphaGo used, which means that it can push artificial intelligence even further.

The global cloud computing sector in the future will be a game between China and the US, a chief of Chinese internet giant Alibaba said Thursday at a conference.
In the next 6 to 12 months, Alibaba Cloud, the subsidiary of Alibaba Group, will face the same difficulties and challenges its American counterparts have encountered, said Hu Xiaoming, President of Alibaba Cloud, at the ""Computing Conference 2017"" in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
Cloud computing will be applied to every industry because of increasing dependence on the internet in this digital era, said Hu, adding that it will bring more opportunities for firms engaged in digital transformation.
Alibaba Cloud is now the world’s third largest cloud computing company following Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Corp.’s Azure.
The US has advantages in the cloud computing market as first comer, but with more driving engines, China will realize digital transformation at a pace faster than the US, Hu added.
Besides Alibaba, other leading tech runners like Baidu, Tencent, Huawei, Ucloud and Lenovo have joined the cloud computing ecosystem as well.
Of those industrial giants, Baidu focuses more on a combination of cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), while Lenovo eyes for digital transformation and industrial upgrade by integrating cloud computing and big data.
Hu said that a new research institute named DAMO Academy has been established by Alibaba to deal with the challenges emerging in the industrialization process of the cloud computing.
“We hope the investment could be a long-term process so that the industrial partners can launch closer cooperation,” he explained.
The DAMO Academy, formally established on Wednesday, will conduct studies on fundamental science and disruptive technology innovation. DAMO stands for ""discovery, adventure, momentum and outlook"".
Alibaba also has pledged to invest over 100 billion yuan (about $15.2 billion) over the next three years in advanced technology development.
The“3A” group, covering Alibaba, AWS and Azure, led the global cloud computing sector in 2016 in terms of market share, according to a report released by authoritative research institute Gartner in late September.
China should work out the standards for cloud data as soon as possible, encourage domestic service providers to explore overseas market, and offer high-tech supports to countries along “the Belt and Road” and globalization process of Chinese companies, industrial experts suggested.

""Xiaofa explains complicated legal terms in everyday language to help the public better understand legal definitions,"" said Du Xiangyang, founder and CEO of AEGIS Data, which designed Xiaofa. ""We used a child's voice to ease the tense emotions of litigants who come here for help.""
The robot can move its head and wave its hands as instructions show up on screen, and it can guide people to the exact service window for litigation services.
The appearance of Xiaofa was a big move for the Beijing court, as the capital works to build a ""smart"" court system. Over 40,000 litigation questions and 30,000 legal issues can be answered by the robot, according to the court.
""Interaction between humans and machines has improved immensely,"" said Ma Laike, deputy head of Beijing No 1 Intermediate People's Court. ""It will decrease the cost of litigation, save trial resources and improve the efficiency of justice.""
Before the robot was introduced into the Beijing court system, it was tested by legal professionals.
In October 2016, China's first AI legal robot, Faxiaotao, was unveiled in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, attracting visitors from home and abroad.
Faxiaotao can help people analyze the best way to solve a dispute, and also assist them in selecting which attorneys are suitable to accept the case, according to the robot's designer, Itslaw, a company that combines internet technology with law.
For example, if a company's corporate client believes its advertisements or advertising slogans have been illegally copied by a rival company and would like to hire an attorney who is a specialist, Faxiaotao will first recognize what kind of case it is and then analyze its database for suitable lawyers who have dealt with similar disputes.
More than 300,000 attorneys across the country were listed in the company's database last year. When a query is made it selects the best three options, the company said.
The Supreme People's Court has ordered Chinese courts at all levels to build technology-friendly systems for lawsuits and explore the use of big data and AI to help judges and litigants search documents and resolve cases.

A video that went viral on Chinese social media recently offered a glimpse into just how far China's cutting-edge surveillance technology has come.
In the video, footage taken by CCTV cameras is instantly tagged with information of passing vehicles and pedestrians, including each person's sex, age and clothing and the model and color of cars. Tags appear on each person and vehicle as soon as they enter the camera's range.
The system is also able to scan faces and compare them with its database of criminal suspects at large. When there is a match, an alarm notifies the police of its findings.
Resembling Minority Report or some other sci-fi movie, this cutting-edge surveillance technology is from a new system developed by SenseTime, a Chinese technology company headquartered in Beijing.
Equipped with 20 million CCTV cameras, China now has the largest monitoring network in the world, according to Amazing China, a six-episode documentary co-produced by the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and China Central Television (whose acronym is also, coincidentally, CCTV).
The network, dubbed ""Skynet"" (a name taken from the fictional net-based artificial intelligence in the futuristic Terminator films), aims to boost public security as personal and societal safety threats increase across the world.
Operation Skynet
Wang Qiang, a specialist in non-war military actions at the National Defense University of the People's Liberation Army, defines the Skynet system as an infrastructure based on artificial intelligence and big data that aims to boost public safety. ""CCTV cameras are like eyes that protects people's safety,"" he said.
Since it was launched in 2011, many Chinese cities have been stepping up their effort to deploy more CCTV cameras.
From 2011 to 2015, the government of Changsha, Hunan Province, invested 528 million yuan ($35.39 million) in the Skynet project, installing over 50,000 CCTV cameras. At least 27,000 of them are high-definition, capable of capturing footage at night using infrared lenses, according to news portal rednet.cn. The government of Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, had deployed 35,000 CCTV cameras in the city by 2016, with over half being high-definition.
The sheer number of new CCTV cameras, however, may not be enough. In 2015, Chinese regulators issued a document on the strengthening of its surveillance camera network, aiming to boost public safety, optimize traffic and serve city management.
According to the document, by 2020 China will build a surveillance network that achieves full coverage in key locations, connected to the Internet and with a serviceability rate at over 95 percent in major public areas. The network will also feature an internal security system, preventing sensitive footage from being hacked or stolen.
Amazing China features a scene at the big data center in the public security bureau in Suzhou, East China's Jiangsu Province, where a large screen exhibits hundreds of scenes captured by CCTV cameras in the city - all in real time.
""CCTV camera coverage on the roads is already very high. If a crime happens, we are capable of zooming into a certain spot on the suspect's body, according to our needs,"" said Zhong Cong, a police officer at the bureau whose responsibility is to analyze and predict crimes based on this footage.
""Criminals will have nowhere to hide thanks to the three-dimensional public security protection system,"" he added.
Apart from the cameras, Suzhou police are also able to predict crimes through big data such as each household's consumption of water and electricity. When anomalies occur, the system will send alarms, according to the documentary.
A big data system on the consumption of fertilizer and petroleum, has also been deployed in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region to alert public security authorities of possible crimes, South Magazine reported earlier. Ammonium nitrate fertilizers, when combined with other reagents, can become a powerful explosive.
No privacy infringement
Statistics show that Skynet has achieved huge successes since it was systematically deployed in 2011, helping decrease the overall crime rate in China.
In the first 8 months in 2016, police in Nanchang arrested 1,600 criminal suspects, solved nearly 3,000 cases and captured images of 90,000 vehicles that violated traffic regulations through the help of Skynet. In the three years since Skynet was deployed in Changsha, police solved over 17,000 cases using Skynet, including murders and robberies.
According to Xinhua, the crime rate for eight types of felonies including drug trafficking, robbery and intentional injury in China dropped 42.7 percent between 2012 to 2016. Over 90 percent of the Chinese population now say they feel safe.
SenseFace's facial recognition system is currently being used by public security authorities in Beijing, Chongqing and other provinces including Guangdong, Sichuan and Hainan, playing an important role in daily monitoring and solving crime cases.
Xu Li, CEO of the company, told thepaper.cn that when the system was first tested in Chongqing, it identified 69 criminal suspects in 40 days. Fifteen of these suspects were later arrested and detained by the police.
The system can also tell the difference between motor vehicles and non-motor vehicles and distinguish between 3800 car models with a 95 percent accuracy rate.
But as China's surveillance network becomes more powerful and all-seeing, some privacy advocates have been questioning whether the system will infringe on personal privacy.
Wang addressed this by saying that, according to Chinese law, public surveillance cameras should be clearly marked. It is also prohibited to install them in private places such as hotel rooms, dormitories or public restrooms.
""These regulations will safeguard people's rights and serve as the legal basis for Skynet,"" he said.
Lower tier, less cameras
Legal experts confirmed that it is completely legal for the police to use Skynet to collect footage.
Xue Jun, professor of law in Peking University, told China News Service that as the footage collected by Skynet are in public areas, people's privacy isn't infringed according to Chinese law.
Xu Kai, a Beijing-based lawyer, said that people's personal information is a right, but also an obligation. When required by law, they must hand everything in to the government.
""However, if this footage is used without authorization or used for purposes other than official crime investigations, there are possibilities of infringement,"" Xu said.
And while the scale of its surveillance network is the biggest in the world, compared with its massive population, China still lags behind developed countries in its deployment of surveillance cameras. For every 1,000 citizens in Beijing (China's most closely-monitored city), for example, there are 59 surveillance cameras, according to statistics released at the 2016 Beijing International Intelligent Hardware Exhibition. This means there is one surveillance camera for every 17 people in Beijing.
In China's second- and third-tier cities, however, the density of CCTV cameras is much lower, estimated at under one per 100 people on average.
In the UK, numbers are estimated at one camera per 14 people and in the US, one for every 10. The British Security Industry Authority estimated in 2013 that there are up to 5.9 million closed-circuit television cameras in the country, including 750,000 in ""sensitive locations"" such as schools, hospitals and care homes, according to the Telegraph.
Experts in the surveillance hardware industry predict more surveillance in the years to come. In 2015, China's video surveillance market was estimated at 74 billion yuan, with the market projected to grow 10 percent each year.",'% artificial intelligence%'

And so a group of 42 African, South Asian and Southeast Asian journalists recently visited DiDi Chuxing, a firm that runs a shared transport platform in the Chinese capital, Beijing, to find out how it helps in facilitating mass transit across the country.
Taking the journalists around, Aaron Liu, one of DiDi’s Public Relations Managers, said the platform was set up in 2012 because the transport situation in major cities was getting worse as demand outstripped supply. The shared public transport platform began with taxis before expanding to other modes of transport.
400 Chinese cities covered
The application enables subscribers to use cost-effective means of transport in 400 Chinese cities, with 450 million registered passengers and 19 million drivers, Sun Liang, DiDi Senior Communications Director explained. On average, 25 million rides are made each day as customers’ requests are responded to with the closest possible services. There are pickup points for passengers.
DiDi's services can be summarised by the belief that there is always a better journey. Photo by Kimeng Hilton
The output of drivers is tracked through Global Positioning Systems (GPS) installed in subscribers’ phones; and also feedback from passengers, explained Sun Liang. This way, hard working and well behaved drivers are rewarded with better pay, Sun Liang told the visiting journalists. According to her, DiDi’s services can be summarized in the catch phrase, “There is always a better journey.”
17.50 million jobs created
As many as 17.50 million job opportunities have been created in 400 cities across China since DiDi came into existence five years ago. The platform helps in transporting more than 440 million passengers. The platform employs 7,000 workers, 50 per cent being engineers and data scientists and half of them being female. Because of the pressure of work, engineers are obliged to exercise at work for 10 to 15 minutes on Wednesdays.
DiDi’s goal is to become a global leader in smart transportation and automotive technology, the world’s largest operator of vehicle networks and a global leader in smart transportation systems by 2020. “We are committed to work with communities and partners to solve the world’s transportation, environmental and employment challenges by using big data-driven deep learning algorithms that optimize resource allocation,” explained Sun Liang.

“By continuously improving users’ experiences and creating social value, we strive to build an open, efficient, collaborative, and sustainable transportation ecosystem,” Sun Liang underscored. After six months of operations, DiDi had only 1,000 rides a day at the end of 2012. Today, it boasts 25 million daily rides. The company’s partners have a fleet of 250,000 electric vehicles.
Foreign outreach
DiDi began extending its activities abroad in 2015. Management believes that there are prospects in the developing world where car ownership is still low. DiDi merged with Uber China in 2015, Kuaidi in 2014 and has partnerships with Ola in India, Taxify in South Africa, Careem in the Middle East and North America, 99 in Brazil, Lyft in the US and Grab in Southeast Asia. DiDi now has 9 different businesses. Meanwhile, Careem is currently testing the shared transport application in Egypt and South Africa.

DiDi Chuxing offers a diverse range of transportation services through one mobile application. It uses an intelligent ride-matching system that ensures multi-person car-pooling within and across cities, real-time traffic mapping and route optimization. Cities are supported by DiDi to efficiently and sustainably plan transportation using big data-based transportation capacity.
Security safeguards
DiDi Express is the most cost effective service costing at least 13 RMB a ride. Normal taxis in Beijing charge from 15 RMB per ride. The security measures taken by DiDi include verifying that drivers are actually who they claim to be, checks are carried out on drivers’ backgrounds and their papers are thoroughly scrutinized in conjunction with law enforcement and local transport authorities, officials stressed. Subscribers’ and drivers’ phone numbers are concealed in order to protect them.
""There is an emergency button on the application installed in subscribers’ phones. There is also round-the-clock service throughout the week,"" Sun Liang assured, adding that the application is able to track down the location of drivers and passengers at any time. Moreover, a comprehensive insurance package is offered to drivers and passengers in the event of accident.
From 12,000 rides a day in 2012, DiDi 's platform today makes an average of 25 million daily rides. Photo by Kimeng Hilton
Averting gridlocks
DiDi makes use of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence to warn drivers and customers of areas of traffic congestion. In order to make better use of time, the application enables subscribers to go to designated pick-up points just when vehicles are about to arrive.

SYDNEY, Oct. 23 (People’s Daily Online) --On 18 October, 2017, the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which attracted worldwide attention, opened in Beijing.
Dr. Hans Hendrischke, a professor at the University of Sydney, Australia, said in an interview with People’s Daily Online that China has become one of the main drivers of global economic development in the areas of trade, investment, and finance. Chinese youth have reason to be proud, he added.
Belt and Road Initiative creates hope for regional economies around China
Dr. Hendrischke said that the success of the Belt and Road Initiative creates a sense of confidence and hope for regional economies around China to integrate into larger markets. They will also be able to share the benefits of technological development and economic growth in a manner that would not be possible if they were operating as individual economies.
Dr. Hendrischke used the energy infrastructure network between China and Central Asia as an example.
“On one hand, this is proof that China is able to project its capital and technology into new regions; on the other hand, this is a demonstration that new markets are emerging that will benefit other partner countries as well,” he said.
The stable and long-term development of our global economy cannot be separated from China
Since joining the WTO in 2001, China has been firmly committed to reforming and opening up, even in the face of rising global protectionism.
“In 2001, China needed the WTO in order to open up its domestic economy,” Dr. Hendrischke said. Furthermore, he believes that China’s economy is currently one of the major drivers of the global economy through trade, investment, and finance. Therefore, the sustainability of China’s economic growth is critical to the long-term stability of the global economy.
China occupies global leadership in many fields
In May 2017, youths from 20 countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative voted for the “new four great inventions”: high speed railways, electronic payments, shared bicycles, and online shopping.
Dr. Hendrischke states that China’s young generation has reason to be proud when they see new products coming out of China.
However, these new creations are “only the tip of the iceberg.”
China is implementing the “Made in China 2025” strategy, which will lead to upgraded manufacturing. Dr. Hendrischke believes that the use of big data and artificial intelligence will allow China to rapidly occupy the leading position in information technology and financial services.
Most importantly, Dr. Hendrischke states that China is an increasingly important part of the global economy and of global social change, and he expects China to keep taking on global responsibilities.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Late last month, a 2,000-kilometer-long quantum fiber link, the longest and most sophisticated in the world, was launched to connect Beijing and Shanghai and provide an unhackable communications route between the cities.
During the link's launch in Beijing, Bai Chunli, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, used Micius, the world's first quantum communication satellite which was launched by China last year, to make the first intercontinental quantum video call and spoke with Anton Zeilinger, his Austrian counterpart, in Vienna.
The breakthrough in quantum communication is one of a number of scientific achievements made by China in the past five years. Thanks to strong policy support and a growing pool of talent that is constantly pushing the envelope of technology, the world's second-largest economy is rapidly being transformed from a follower to a global leader in innovation.
The shift is in line with the call by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, on Wednesday for more efforts to make China into a country of innovators and reach the frontiers of science and technology.
Innovation is the primary force driving development, and it is the strategic underpinning for building a modernized economy, Xi said in a report delivered to the CPC's 19th National Congress.
""We will strengthen basic research in applied sciences, launch major national science and technology projects, and prioritize innovation in key generic technologies, cutting-edge frontier technologies, modern engineering technologies, and disruptive technologies,"" the president added.
Progress has already been made in the past five years, and China has emerged as a leader in the field of technology, with breakthroughs ranging from the maiden flight of the country's first homegrown large passenger aircraft to the debut of the fastest train in the world, from the Beidou Navigation Satellite System, which is set to cover the world by 2020, to robotics and artificial intelligence technologies that are widely regarded as the next frontier of growth.
According to the 2017 report of the World Intellectual Property Organization, China is the only middle-income country in the list of the world's top 25 most innovative economies, where it is ranked 22nd.
The achievement was lauded by Wan Gang, minister of Science and Technology, who said, ""On the whole, we have met the goal of 'occupying a place' in the major fields of science and technology, which lays a sound foundation for China to be an innovation powerhouse.""
Meanwhile, a special issue of the scientific journal Nature noted that ""Chinese science has been moving at breakneck speed for the past few decades, fueled by vast infusions of cash and a rapidly growing technical workforce.""

Outstripping competition
According to Nature, China now boasts more researchers than the United States, outspends the European Union in research and development and ""is on track to best all other nations in its yearly production of scientific papers"".
Bai, from CAS, commented: ""Important scientific work has mushroomed in China in recent years. It is the result of years of research and development. Policy guidance, financial support and continued efforts to deepen reform have all played parts in stimulating this vitality.""
More important, according to analysts, scientific research has been efficiently commercialized, with China pouring large sums into the latter stages of the R&D process, during which discoveries are turned into products.
High-speed rail has been one of the most impressive areas of progress. In recent years, China has built the world's largest high-speed rail network and become a world leader in providing globally competitive high-speed products and services.
By 2020, China Railway Rolling Stock Corp, which manufacturers the country's high-speed trains, is expected to supply new bullet trains with a maximum operating speed of 400 kilometers per hour to markets related to the Belt and Road Initiative. The new trains will also cut per passenger energy consumption by 10 percent, compared with trains that run at 350 km/h.
""Over the past few years, China has demonstrated its competitive edge in high-speed rail technology,"" said Wang Mengshu, a railway expert and a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Navigating the future
After it was confirmed that Beidou, the homegrown navigation satellite system, covered the entire Asia-Pacific region in 2012, several more satellites were launched, enabling wider applications in logistics, aviation, precision farming and other industries that demand high-accuracy positioning.
Earlier this month, for the first time, Beidou was used to guide a Chinese-developed regional jetliner as it successfully completed a test flight at an airport in the eastern province of Shandong.
The flight demonstrated that Beidou's performance is on a par with similar systems produced overseas and meets internationally advanced levels in transient and quick positioning index, according to the plane's manufacturer, Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China.

Meanwhile, a tide of innovation is sweeping China, helping the country to evolve from an ""innovation sponge"", absorbing and adapting existing technology and knowledge from around the world, into a global leader in innovation, spawning a wide range of homegrown cutting-edge products and services.
Nothing better demonstrates this than the bike-sharing phenomenon. Created by Chinese players, including Ofo and Mobike, GPS-enabled, dockless bikes are now improving the lives of people in big cities at home and abroad who are fed up with congested roads and long for zero-emissions forms of transportation.
In September, Ofo announced that it would launch its services in four European countries?the Czech Republic, Italy, Russia and the Netherlands?moving the company closer to meeting its ambitious goal of entering 200 cities in 20 countries by the end of the year.
""In stark contrast to the previous generation of Chinese companies that focused on domestic growth until the market became saturated, emerging startups are better at coming up with their own ideas and better aware of the opportunities abroad,"" said Zhang Xu, an analyst at Analysys, a market researcher in Beijing.
The surge in mass entrepreneurship and innovation, buoyed by favorable government policies, is noticeable. By the end of last year, the country had nearly 26 million registered private and State-owned businesses, a rise of 18.8 percent from the previous year, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.
More important, 71 internet companies are ""unicorns"", that is, private businesses valued at more than $1 billion each. Notably, four of them?Didi Chuxing, Xiaomi, Lu and Meituan-Dianping?have made the list of the world's 10 most valuable unicorns.
According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China's artificial intelligence sector is now equal to those in leading global powers in terms of voice, image and semantics recognition technologies.
Li Shu, a partner at Boston Consulting said: ""China is a global pioneer in the field of internet development, as the growth in the number of netizens and the volume of internet consumption both top the corresponding rates in other nations. We have found that innovation permeates much quicker in China than the United States because Chinese netizens are more willing to accept new applications.""
Online shopping
For example, online shopping is now the norm for hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers. The advent of e-commerce, online payment and courier services means consumers can have goods delivered to their doorsteps within hours with just a few taps on their mobile gadgets.
In the past five years, China's online retail market has surged from 1.3 trillion yuan ($196.5 billion) to 5.2 trillion yuan, raising living standards in both big cities and villages, according to a report released this month by Alibaba's research unit.
Juggernauts such as Alibaba and JD.com have lured shoppers through the use of annual discount shopping galas that could eventually eclipse Black Friday in the US.
Moreover, smaller players are pushing ahead with the digital shopping frenzy by connecting a larger number of affluent Chinese with a wide array of foreign goods, while companies such as Red and Kaola, which is owned by NetEase, are heavily promoting cross-border e-commerce.
Market researcher eMarketer estimates that by 2020, half of China's digital shoppers-about one-quarter of the country's population of 1.4 billion?will be buying foreign products online and total sales will top $157 billion.
Likewise, the country's mobile payment industry has made its mark in the outside world by moving away from its original function of simply facilitating transactions and embracing new activities such as wealth management, credit scoring and utility bill payments.
Girish Ramachandran, Asia-Pacific president of Tata Consultancy Services, India's largest information technology company, said China's rapid strides in digital technologies and innovation capability have indirectly inspired India to digitize its economy.
For example, Ant Financial Services, the owner of China's largest mobile payment service, has brought its wireless payment solutions to its Indian counterpart Paytm.com, and the two signed an agreement in 2015 to create a local version of Alipay.

The city of Hangzhou’s traffic efficiency has seen substantial improvements a year after it introduced its “City Brain” project, with an artificial intelligence (AI) hub that uses big data to help it ""think"" and make decisions better.
The program started in October 2016 with a vision of building Hangzhou into a smart city with the ability to regulate itself and interact better with its human occupants.
Hangzhou is the capital of east China’s Zhejiang province and the first city in the world to manage its public affairs with AI technology assistance.
Some of the latest beneficiaries of the program are the local traffic police, since the “City Brain” has started helping them maintain traffic and respond quicker to traffic accidents.
“The City Brain can detect accidents within a second, and we can arrive at the site in 5 minutes,” said Zheng Yijiong, a traffic police officer and the first police officer in China to control the traffic with an AI partner.
The AI hub offers real-time analysis and deployment advice for smooth traffic flows in an area with more than 9 million residents, and manages traffic lights at 128 intersections, saving 15.3% in waiting time at pilot areas. And the City Brain controls traffic lights automatically at more than 100 intersections, cutting travel time on elevated highways by 4.6 minutes.
The system has reported more than 500 traffic accidents in the downtown area daily, with an accuracy of 92%, greatly improving traffic police’s efficiency.
In Xiaoshan District, an ambulance used only half the time that it used before to arrive on the scene because of the smart traffic light control technology.
The traffic control is just the first step in City Brain governance, said Wang Jian, chairman of the Alibaba Group’s Technology Steering Committee, one of the project developers.
In the future, the City Brain will become an important part of the infrastructure to drive the city towards sustainable development, based on Internet, computing and data, Wang added.
Hangzhou’s experience has been duplicated in other cities, including Suzhou, Quzhou and Macao, which are looking for ways to cope with their growing traffic congestion.
Hangzhou has become the biggest beneficiary of mobile internet-enabled social services, with smart cities developing rapidly. All you needs to live there is a smart phone and, statistics show more than 95% of the supermarkets and convenience stores in the city using Alipay, a mobile payment service of Alibaba. Over 98% of local taxis accepting mobile payments.
Hangzhou residents can now pay for more than 60 public services, vehicle and health care with Alipay.
Nearly 600 Chinese cities are working on a smart city approach and, with the development of big data, Internet of things and AI, China is expected to see an upsurge in smart city building.
The market value of Chinese smart cities is expected to exceed 6 trillion yuan ($904.87 billion) in 2017 and 18.7 trillion yuan in 2021, Shenzhen’s Qianzhan Industry Research Institute has predicted.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba surpassed its US counterpart Amazon as the world's biggest e-commerce company on October 11 after the Hangzhou-headquartered company established the DAMO Academy, a new research institute, on the same day.
It is the second time Alibaba has exceeded Amazon in terms of market value. The first time happened three years ago when Alibaba listed.
The internet giant has also pledged to invest more than 100 billion yuan (about $15.1 billion) over the next three years in advanced technology development.
The DAMO Academy is said to have a connection with its founder Jack Ma’s love for kung fu stories. In Chinese novels, the Damo Academy is a top martial arts institution.
“DAMO” has rich connotations in the Chinese language: It’s the Chinese name for Bodhidharma, a Buddhist monk from India, who once meditated and practiced martial arts at Shaolin Temple in Henan Province. Zen, a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang Dynasty as Chan Buddhism, started with Bodhidharma.
According to Alibaba, DAMO stands for ""discovery, adventure, momentum and outlook,"" and the institute will focus on fundamental science and disruptive technological innovation.
With an ambition of serving at least 2 billion users worldwide, Ma expects the academy to outlive Alibaba and be able to solve problems with future-oriented technologies.
The academy will research quantum computing, machine learning, basic algorithms, network security, visual computing, natural language processing, human-machine interaction, chip technology, sensor technology and embedded systems.
The institute has begun to set up cutting-edge research centers and laboratories for different research areas around the globe.
It will recruit 100 researchers from around the world in the preliminary stage. George Church, a leading light of the Human Genome Project, and Michael I. Jordan, a mastermind in artificial intelligence, have joined the team.",'% artificial intelligence%'

A nanosecond is a long time in the semiconductor sector while three years is an eternity.
Back in 2013, Chinese smartphone chipmakers had a mountain to climb against global rivals such as Qualcomm Inc in the United States.
They barely even had a presence in the low-end segment of the market.
But all that changed after the government rolled out new policies and domestic players broke through technological barriers.
""Three years ago, we relied chiefly on a price war to crack the market,"" said Li Liyou, CEO of Spreadtrum Communications Inc, one of the largest chipmakers on the Chinese mainland.
""But as more resources were poured into research and development, we saw a fundamental change,"" Li added.
Plans to upgrade the homegrown chip industry are in line with the central leadership's call to turn China into a manufacturer of quality.
""We will move Chinese industries up to the medium-high end of the global value chain, and foster a number of world-class advanced manufacturing clusters,"" Party General Secretary Xi Jinping said at the opening of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Beijing on Wednesday.
Data from research agency IC Insights revealed that 11 Chinese companies were on the global top 50 list for integrated circuit designers in 2016. Only one domestic business was on it in 2009.
Spreadtrum Communications Inc is a classic example of what is happening inside the industry. It produced more than 600 million smartphone chips last year, accounting for over 25 percent of the world's total shipments.
Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world's third largest smartphone manufacturer, is also making inroads with its in-house Kirin chips.
In 2014, China's largest telecom equipment maker was struggling to upgrade its semiconductor division, despite putting together a program a decade earlier.
But now most of its smartphones, including high-end models, are powered by Kirin chips. Last month, the Shenzhen-based business unveiled its first artificial intelligence chip, Kirin 970, with superfast computing and strong image-recognition capabilities.
It powers Huawei's new Mate 10 smartphone, which was launched on Monday to compete with Apple Inc's 10th-anniversary iPhone.
""AI can enable real-time language translation, heed voice commands, or take advantage of augmented reality, which overlays text, sounds, graphics and video on real-world images,"" said Yu Chengdong, CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Group.
Figures released from the China Semiconductor Industry Association showed that the domestic chip sector reported sales of 434 billion yuan ($65 billion) last year, an increase of 20 percent compared to 2015.
Xiang Ligang, a telecom expert and CEO of industry website Cctime, pointed out that Chinese companies are now benefiting from the government's policy to cultivate a domestic chip industry.
The program was put in place amid concerns that a heavy reliance on foreign technology would affect national security.
There were also other reasons, such as the fact that China was spending more on overseas chips than crude oil imports.
In 2014, Beijing set up China's Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund to support the sector and spur private financing.
One of the biggest beneficiaries was Tsinghua Unigroup, the parent company of Spreadtrum.
Earlier this year, it signed financing deals worth 150 billion yuan to carry on R&D into new homegrown chips.
This will give the State-owned technology group enough cash to fulfill its grand ambitions in the semiconductor sector, and join the ranks of global giants, such as Intel Corp, Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics Co.
Among the investors are China Development Bank and China's Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund.
""The next several years are key ... there is an enormous market out there,"" said Zhao Weiguo, chairman of Tsinghua Unigroup.
To illustrate that, Tsinghua Unigroup is now working on a $30 billion domestic memorychip production complex in Nanjing, Jiangsu province.
It will become China's largest plant when completed.
Private companies, such as Xiaomi, are also making major strides. The smartphone manufacturer unveiled its first in-house chipset in March.
Named Surge S1, the chip combines four powerful and efficient cores, which can help strike a balance between performance and power efficiency.
""Chip technology is the crown in the smartphone sector, but it is highly cash intensive,"" said Lei Jun, founder and CEO of Xiaomi.
""If we want to challenge the world's top three players, we need to devote our long-term efforts into the research and development of chips,"" Lei added.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Attendees who answered reporters' questions include Jiang Fengyi (second from left), deputy head of Nanchang University; Wang Endong (third from left), chief scientist at Inspur Group; Wang Zhigang (third from right), vice-minister of science and technology; Wang Xiujie (second from right), a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences; and Lu Jianjun (right), head of science and technology in Shaanxi province. FENG YONGBIN/CHINA DAILY
China is stepping up efforts to build a ""fair and just"" ecosystem to better motivate science talent and facilitate technological innovation, a senior official said on Friday.
Since 2012, China's science and technology has ""generally, and in some cases fundamentally, affected China's socioeconomic development"", Wang Zhigang, vice-minister of science and technology, told reporters at a briefing at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
China's gross expenditure for research and development grew from 1.03 trillion yuan ($156 billion) in 2012 to 1.57 trillion yuan in 2016, with 77.5 percent being spent by enterprises. China also has topped the world for the six consecutive years in patent applications, including 1.34 million in 2016, more than double that in 2012, according to the Ministry of Science and Technology.
Those achievements are fueled by a total of 3.81 million science workers, the largest group in the world. ""Innovation cannot be achieved solely by scientists in ivory towers. It has to be integrated closely with the economy, society, people's livelihood and national security,"" Wang said.
As a result, the bulk of the reforms need to focus on motivating science workers, and ""creating a more fair and just ecosystem to support technological innovation"", he said.
Such an environment will include supportive legal, political, cultural and social elements, Wang said. At the same time, governments should strengthen basic research, improve science literacy and let the market economy play its role. ""We try to let everyone find their value in their innovation, and make scientists happy,"" he said.
To achieve these goals, Wang said China needs three ingredients. The first is a top-down blueprint to ""organically bind innovation to China's socioeconomic development and modernization process"".
The second is clarifying ""who should do what"". The main drivers of Chinese innovation are research institutes, universities and companies, and they have helped China take the lead in several important fields ranging from artificial intelligence to quantum communication, he said.
Chinese science enterprises had total operating revenue of 26.1 trillion yuan in 2016, up by 17.5 percent annually. Technology contracts' value passed 1 trillion yuan in 2016, up 77.2 percent from 2012, according to the science and technology ministry.
Still, companies and universities may not be able to do massive basic scientific research, such as China's recent contribution to the discovery of a new gravitational wave, because it requires national support, so government should play the leading role, he said.
As a result, the third part is stepping up efforts in basic and application research, technology innovation and commercialization, to ""greatly improve our industries' competitiveness and the general strength of our economic development"", Wang said.
Wang Xiujie, a biologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and also a delegate, said China has simplified procedures in areas like project applications and budget requests, ""giving front-line scientists a lot of flexibility"".
Wang Endong, chief scientist of Inspur Group, China's largest server maker, said companies are treating science workers better. The government also approved policies on housing and schooling support for science workers.",'% artificial intelligence%'

During these five years, many internal and external events occurred, both with negative and positive influences. However, this all corroborated that it is essential to have adequate planning to face all kinds of adversities.
Externally, there were political, economic, and social issues that affected much of the world, either directly or indirectly. In working toward the goal of the “China Dream,” it was necessary to be united, determined, and competent.
Marriage is necessary for the success of any country. The government, the Party, the military, and the people must all be on the same page. In this way, it was possible to give all Chinese a ""moderately prosperous life"" and advance the goal of poverty eradication. Being close to the population and listening to their suggestions and complaints is fundamental to keeping the Party on the right course, and China has mastered this strategy.
Another critical variable was determination. Over the past few years, President Xi has emphasized and carried out essential steps toward deepening reforms.
This has been fundamental because besides from demanding political will, a great determination was necessary to change or alter wrong courses. The Chinese government has acted steadily, but other essential reforms remain for the next administration.
Finally, the last variable that contributed to the success was competence. We will now present the hypothetical Governance Model of President Xi Jinping, which we have consolidated into six main pillars. We will cite from recent political and economic achievements of the government.
The six pillars are: National Sovereignty, Deepening of Reforms and Rights, Educational and Cultural Development, Economic Development and Environment, Foreign Policy, and Creation and Monitoring of Institutional Norms.
In the last five years, I have highlighted the following about National Sovereignty. For example, the implantation of the modernization of the armed forces, the fair recognition of the value of the military, the development of deterrent and informatization capacities, creation of strong ties through the concept of duality, where military and civilians began working partnerships to generate products with higher added value.
The firm position was maintained on the legitimacy of Chinese Sovereignty in the South China Sea and the start of the strategic ""Grand Bay"" project that integrates Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau.
Regarding the deepening of reforms and rights, we highlight several actions to combat poverty and carry out tax reforms, reforms in the financial market, and changes in judicial bodies.
Regarding health, China has increased housing for the needy and has taken actions such as hospital reforms and creating better financial conditions for doctors and other health professionals
Regarding educational and cultural development, we highlight the effort to adapt education to the new world technological context. And regarding culture, there was the more significant dissemination of Chinese culture, improvements in the maintenance of cultural heritage, and the encouragement of the population to carry out tourism within China.
Concerning economic development and the environment, we highlight macroeconomic policies to equalize economic growth under the conditions of the ""New Normal,"" policies to encourage the services sector, facilitation of foreign capital investments, and development of innovation within the new context of the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"" among other necessary measures.
About the environment, the government reinforced measures to improve the situation through the deactivation or restructuring of ""zombie companies,"" the creation of more environmentally friendly locations, such as ""Ecological Buildings,"" and a firm policy against environmental polluters.
In foreign policy, the government acted in several areas, depending on the characteristics of the other country. For example, we highlight discussions on the issues of nuclear arms control, counter-terrorism, combating social inequality and eradicating poverty, the development of the grand world-wide strategic plan for Belt and Road, and other critical related actions.
Finally, subjects on the creation and monitoring of institutional norms showed us two critical actions. First, the policy of the government-party-population approach, which as we said was of utmost importance to China's success, and two, the government's vigorous activity against waste and especially in the fight against corruption.
What challenges and measures can be discussed and determined at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party for the next administration?
This question is incredibly complex, because of the planning required for the next five years of a country as great and important as China.
I will outline some challenges and some guidelines, which in my opinion, may arise at this critical meeting.
”""Innovation"" will certainly be one of the most important issues over the next five years. That's because, we know we're going through the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution,"" and its effects will be massive in most activities. Also, there are still enormous tasks for the Chinese government to look at and use their resolve to solve many challenges.
Regarding National Sovereignty, I believe that the insertion of ""cyber-physical"" systems will be intense in the processes of manufacturing equipment for national defense. Also, the Chinese government has determined that the development of military equipment, where possible, obey the principle of duality. This means that defense companies and private companies must work together more closely in the development of new equipment. In this context, ""cybersecurity"" should also have a special treatment, because its control will be fundamental to the sovereignty of any country.
I do not doubt that through ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,"" China will achieve its goal of building a moderately prosperous society, but it will be necessary to worry about some essential aspects.
For example, the process of deepening social reforms has very similar characteristics in any country in the world. First, improvements are more accessible to carry out, but once the process increases, the pace slows down, and more determined the government and Party will need to be to implement them.
An essential subject that must also be addressed will be how to prepare young people from their studies to their work.
In this new digital world, there isno way to follow old ways. The modernizations and demands of potential employers will have a very significant diversity and speed of change.
Therefore, I believestudents will need to be matched with the demand of companies. I only see one way. Educational institutions and companies must work together to create curriculum. With this, the number of unemployed young people will be reduced. The need for more vocational schools and startups in China also emerges.
In defining the growth of the economy for the next few years, not only should macroeconomic fundamentals be considered, but these technological and structural changes in productive modes should be predicted.
This is not an easy task, because every day new combinations of tools and sectors arise that focus on changing demands. However, I believe that among other areas of knowledge: nanotechnology, robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and energy storage systems, among others, should be the new priority.
Lastly, we must speak of measures for the tireless fight against corruption, which is being improved every day.

Xi called for building a cyberspace community of common destiny featuring equality and respect, innovative development, openness and sharing, as well as security and order on Wednesday while giving a speech via livestream video to the opening ceremony of the third WIC in the riverside town of Wuzhen in East China's Zhejiang Province, pledging China’s cooperation with the international community.
The Internet has brought earthshaking changes to the thinking of human beings, their lifestyle, as well as the global architecture of economy, interest and security, the commentary pointed out, while admitting that though the booming technology innovation and application have prevailed, the lingering imbalance, spawned rules, and disorder pose challenges to the global Internet space.
The paper added that the global cyberspace is also threatened by risks like disclosure of private information, infringement of personal privacy and intellectual property, rampant cyber crimes, cyber attacks, cyber terrorism and other unresolved public hazards.
What’s more, the current cyberspace management rules can not address needs of the majority of countries, the article stressed, urging that widening information gap between different nations and regions must be narrowed down first in order to build a cyberspace community of common destiny.
Of the four targets raised by Xi, “equality and respect” servers as the primary requirement, the article said, explaining that the present conflicts and imbalances in global cyberspace require a stronger institutional architecture, a multilateral, democratic and transparent reform of the Internet governance system, as well as more trust and cooperation among stakeholders under the framework of cyberspace sovereignty.
The “innovative development” is an indigenous demand for the industry, according to the paper. It explained that in order to cope with the global imbalance in Internet technologies, the world has to resort to innovation for all-shared benefits.
The world should share the Internet technologies and applications by updating the mindset, ideology and rules, breaking the monopoly of core technologies and standards and encouraging more competition in core technologies, standards and products, thus building a transparent, balanced and secure cyberspace, the article advised.
An “open and shared” Internet is necessary because the Internet technology can only be advanced in application and communication, commented the article.
It further pointed out that the sharing economy, inclusive finance, intelligent health care, artificial intelligence, e-commerce and a host of other dividends brought by an open Internet can lead the world toward a community of common destiny and shared prosperity.
A “secure and orderly” Internet environment is the basic precondition for cyberspace community, the paper added, stressing the importance of proper settlement of cyberspace threats like information leakage, cyber espionage and Internet fraud.
Each country, especially the developing ones, should join hands to crack down on universal hazards like Internet attacks and online terrorism, maintain a clean and orderly domestic cyber environment and sustain the peace and stability of international cyberspace, it underlined.
The article analyzed that though China is a major Internet user, it is not yet an Internet power in the world. Like most countries in the Third World, China faces both opportunities and challenges presented by Internet development.
Amid such backdrop, China will not only contribute products, technologies and market, but also systems, culture and ideas to build an interconnected cyberspace community of shared destiny, so that the Internet could bring more bonus to the world, the article concluded.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Insiders from IMT-2020(5G) promotion group, which is dedicated to boosting the systematic promotion of 5G, said second-phase testing will be launched in 2017.
Authoritative insiders also disclosed that the experimental stage of 5G will last three years, from 2016 to 2018. The construction of a 5G network will begin in 2019, with a total budget of 500 billion RMB ($73 billion).
Huang Yuhong, deputy general manager of China Mobile's research institute, said that the three biggest operators in China will cooperate with equipment manufacturers for testing, adding that the first standard for 5G will be announced in 2018.
Industry analysts believe that the commercialization of a 5G network will not only bolster the telecommunications industry, but will also drive other emerging sectors, such as big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and more.
Currently, 42 domestic companies are working with the 5G Joint Innovation Center, researching the development of Internet of Things, car networking, industrial Internet and other areas. Some projects have reportedly entered the commercial operation phase, ready to be tested and promoted in the future.
In addition to Chinese firms, foreign telecom firms including Qualcomm, Ericsson and Nokia are likely to be among the first companies to launch large-scale commercial use of 5G services.

Realizing the dilemma years earlier, China has given its prescription by prioritizing the robot industry in manufacturing sector.
“Right now, the human worker who does, say, 50,000 dollars worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed . . . If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you’d think that we’d tax the robot at a similar level,” Gates said in a recent interview.
The world's wealthiest man suggested that tax be used as a way to fund other types of employment, such as retraining of workers replaced by robots.
Expert believed that the billionaire’s “odd idea” was, in essence, seeking for a balance between rising efficiency brought by automation and the care for human interests, especially for the vulnerable groups.
Li Xiaohua, a research fellow with the Institute of Industrial Economics under Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), at the same time pointed out that if a certain country imposes tax on robots, its manufacturing industry’s competence will be impeded because of slower rise of efficiency.
The export will then be affected by lower manufacturing efficiency, and more jobs will be slashed as a result, he added.
A new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is emerging, so it’s not a wise move to tax on robots and artificial intelligence since such decision will slow down the intellectualization process, Li explained.
Both robots and artificial intelligence are core of new economy represented by smart manufacturing, he added.
The stagnancy of China's manufacturing industry, if persists, will cause loss to factories with low efficiency or financial deficit. Therefore, the industry, pressed with the waning demographic dividend and rising labor cost, is in urgent need to be transformed and upgraded.
The farsighted Chinese government has realized the challenges earlier.In the ""Made in China 2025"" plan rolled out by State Council in 2015, industry robot was defined as a key player to shift the country away from low-end manufacturing.
It also listed robot industry a direction of future development, in a hope to upgrade the manufacturing sector into a digitized, intelligent industry with large sizes and completed system.
In addition to the efforts, China introduced more policies to guarantee employment. The government is tasked with creating at least 50 million new urban jobs, and capping unemployment rate at 5 percent by 2020, in the guidelines on promoting employment during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) issued by the State Council at the end of January.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Analysts believed that it also offered China and the world an glimpse into the promising business sectors they can invest in.
1. Sharing economy
The sharing economy sector saw deals worth some 3.45 trillion yuan ($500 billion) last year. Before the government work report made clear to support and guide the development of the sharing economy, the National Development and Reform Commission also solicitedpublic advice on a sharing economy guideline. The sector is believed to meet greater opportunities.
2. Sports industry
China has incorporated the hosting of 2022 Winter Olympics into the synergetic development plan of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province. The country's plan to encourage 300 million Chinese people to participate in ice sports will definitely promote the development of China's winter sports industry. In addition, China's national fitness strategy calls for the construction of new fitness trails and sports facilities, which will serve as a new chance for the development of sports industry.
3. Emerging industries
The government work report proposed to accelerate the research and development, as well as upgrade of the technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G, indicating the prosperity of emerging industries. The value of China's AI market is expected to hit 9.1 billion yuan by 2020. In addition, the application of 5G technology will not only usher communication industry into a new booming round, but also leverage a number of trillion-yuan emerging sectors.
4. Smart manufacturing
The output of China's smart manufacturing is expected to reach 3 trillion yuan by 2020. According to the government work report, China plans to further implement the strategy of ""Made in China 2025"" and take smart manufacturing as a priority. Smart manufacturing may brace for a broader space in the future.
5. Digital home network
“Digital home network"" is one of the new words in this year's government work report. It is able to bring medical, e-government and e-commerce services to families by linking and managing the digital devices household-wide. The report proposed to expand consumption on digital home network, affirming the importance of its development on policy level.
6. Combination of medical and nursing care
China's increasing aging population has resulted to a larger size of nursing industry. The need to combine medical and nursing care, and facilitate the elderly with continuous, in-time and professional services has become more and more urgent. The combination of medical and nursing care is encountering a historic opportunity.
7. Clean energy vehicles
According to the report, the government has made detailed requirement on vehicle management as part of the efforts to make the sky blue again. With more construction of infrastructure such as charging poles, clean energy vehicles will become the choice for more and more people.
8. All-in-one tourism
By integrating regional resources, an all-in-one tourism model can better protect the environment of scenic spots while developing local tourism resources. The cost-effective model will be a new trend in the future.
9. E-commerce and express delivery
The turnover of China's online retailing sector in rural areas amounted to 894.54 billion yuan in 2016, accounting for 17.4 percent of the country's total. Some enterprises have already expanded their business in rural areas, extending e-commerce and express delivery services to the countryside. Cost reduction and personnel training require a long process which generates abundant opportunities.
10. Renewable energy

As official figures show Chinese economic growth is increasingly dependent on technological advancement, the government has pledged to create a better policy environment to facilitate research and development.
Technological improvement contributed 56.2 percent to economic development in 2016, highlighting the increasingly important role of creativity in the economy, according to the annual government work report, which was delivered by Premier Li Keqiangon Sunday at the opening of the National People's Congress (NPC).
Last year, China further implemented the strategy of promoting innovation-driven development, and a number of world-leading technological breakthroughs have been achieved, Li said.
Beijing and Shanghai were selected by the central government to become ""technological creative centers with global influence."" Six State-level pilot creative industrial parks were established, and the number of patents for inventions surpassed 1 million, while the trade volume of technological patents surpassed 1 trillion yuan.
According to the report, China will support both a national strategy to boost heavyweight technological research programs and foster small- and medium-sized tech enterprises with means like tax breaks.
Excited about AI
""The days when China sustained its economic growth primarily through secondary industry have long gone,"" said Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based independent industry analyst. Liu said the tertiary sector already accounts for more than half of the economy.
This year, China will accelerate the development of new industries, including artificial intelligence (AI) and fifth-generation telecommunications, among others, the report said.
Chinese tech tycoons were excited about the first inclusion of AI in the government work report. Widely perceived as the next industrial revolution, ""AI will surely promote the Chinese economy,"" Lei Jun, CEO of leading tech firm Xiaomi, wrote in his motion to the NPC, citing a research report by Accenture Institute. The US-based consultancy said that the impact of AI on business is projected to boost labor productivity by up to 40 percent.
As an NPC deputy, Lei on Monday proposed the Chinese government should issue more support for R&D into AI and to attract talented developers.
Amid the economic slowdown and rising labor costs, the Chinese government is resolved to infuse traditional industries with new technologies. The National Development and Reform Commission plans to see domestic AI applications worth hundreds of billions of yuan by 2018.
Lei believes that in the following five to 10 years, Chinese phone makers will be able to compete for leadership of the global smartphone market.
""Chinese firms can battle with their overseas peers with their value-for-money products, which are not only low-cost, but also feature technological breakthroughs and innovation,"" said Lei.
Such confidence is supported by Xiaomi's recent technological breakthroughs in the mobile processor market which has been predominantly controlled by US chip giant Qualcomm. On February 28, Xiaomi introduced its own in-house medium- and high-end mobile processor to become the world's fourth phone maker to manufacture its own chips.
Big data province
The role of technology in boosting local economies is probably best exemplified in Guizhou Province, in Southwest China. In March 2016, the central government decided to establish the country's first State-level big data industrial park in Guizhou, a mountainous province that is economically backward. The program is aimed at cultivating a number of leading companies in the industry and transforming the local economy in three to five years. Through the pioneering industry, Guizhou is expected to lead economic development among Chinese provinces in the foreseeable future.
By 2016, there were 39 companies dedicated to big data services in Guizhou, with a supporting network of more than 800 companies, creating business worth 320 billion yuan ($46.4 billion) in the high-tech sector in the traditionally rural province.
Ma Changqing, an NPC deputy from Guizhou, said the province has attracted China's three major telecom operators as well as Qualcomm and Huawei, and that the national big data laboratories based in the province are serving enterprises around the country.
""Although China has become a world leader in a number of high-tech sectors including AI, obstacles remain for the country to become a global tech center,"" said Liu Dingding.
In order to boost the creativity of talented tech workers, the work report has urged reforms in universities and institutes to provide shares and dividends to employees and better allocate funding.
China will also aim to attract talent from overseas with effective measures in order to realize the ambition of innovation, the report states.",'% artificial intelligence%'

“The research on brain science and artificial intelligence is at a crucial stage. Chinese scientists should seize the opportunity to make substantial contributions,” Zhang Xu, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told Science and Technology Daily.
According to Zhang, China’s brain project will integrate brain science and brain-inspired intelligence technology, focusing mainly on diagnosis and intervention for brain diseases, as well as on the development of new AI computation methods and devices.
“Neuroscience and artificial intelligence should not be separated. The country that can boost the integrated development of the two fields will be the true winner in future brain science,” said Zhang.
There is now clear recognition by the international scientific community that brain science is an important frontier. The U.S., Europe and Japan have all announced massive projects to map the brain, giving them a potential advantage over China.
According to statistics from Science and Technology Daily, the U.S. and Germany have 24,624 and 7,328 neuroscience research groups respectively, while China has only 4,938. Though government investment in brain science increased from 348 million RMB in 2010 to 500 million RMB in 2013, financial constraints still hinder the development of brain science in China.
In response to the current problems, Zhang suggested that the country attract more scientists and experts from abroad to come work in China.

BG: Every time I go, you know China’s advancing, whether it’s the buildings, or the people we are meeting with, or the technology. So it’s been exciting to keep going back and see how quickly it’s improving.
Z: You’ve made so many trips to China over the years. What do you think is the most significant change that has taken place in China? And how has the Chinese people changed in your eyes?
BG: I’d say two things. One is the miracle of Chinese economic development since 1990, lifting people out of poverty, building up the infrastructure, developing world-class universities.
I remember almost every year somebody says, well now the China boom it’s reached its limits. And then 3 years later, they’ll say it’s reached its limits…Of course, even today there’s some strains and challenges, but still the growth is lifting people up. And it’s quite impressive.
The second thing I’d say is that China is embracing its role in the world more. Of course its first priority was the poverty in the country, but in parallel to that now China has joined the World Trade Organization, and China’s made really big commitments to Africa, both financially and about partnership. And in the region, the Belt & Road project is about tying together the economies for mutual benefit. So all of that has been exciting to see.
Z: Does the Gates Foundation have any plans to help China complete the last mile of the conquest? How do you see China’s role in global development and governance?
BG: The work of the Gates Foundation in China has two phases. One is the work in China itself, helping people with HIV, helping avoid people getting infected, working on tuberculosis and smoking (control).
Our second phase is a three-way partnership, where developing countries, China and the foundation find ways to work together. And taking some (of China’s) strengths like livestock vaccines; rice, including super green rice, where China’s very strong. So, (there’re) many examples. Ethiopia is a good example, where funding animal vaccine projects are what we are working on together. A group called CADFund is the local Chinese partner.
So the commitment to help other parts of the world is very important; that’s something that historically the U.S. has been very good at, but today we find some discussion in the current administration about should that generosity continue, and what kind of level that generosity should be. And where should that aid piece go in the budget? We need Europe to continue that generosity, I’d be disappointed if the US cuts back. But it’s fantastic that China, because of its success, is joining in and in its unique way. So I am glad to see the leadership. (The scale of some of the infrastructure projects) I think it’s a $60 billion commitment that was made in FOCAC to help the African countries. That’s a realistic acceleration under his (Xi’s) leadership.
Z: My understanding is you showed confidence in China’s poverty alleviation?
BG: In my annual letter I mentioned, we asked people to guess how much poverty has been reduced in the world. And almost no one we interviewed knew that. But maybe in China, because people have been through it, it would be more plausible. But the visibility of the good things that are going on in Africa or other poor countries are very low in the US, because most people don’t get to go there. And they are hearing just about the bad things. Of course there are many challenges, in terms of disease, famine… Africa still has problems. But they don’t realize that the world is making improvement, in things like literacy and nutrition.
The Chinese partnership will go and help to accelerate that improvement. And there are many lessons and things that China did very, very well, in the agricultural economy and manufacturing economy.
Z: Being a successful entrepreneur and philanthropist, you have made substantial contribution to communication and collaboration between the two countries. Based on your own experiences, how do you see the role that business collaboration plays in Sino-U.S. relations?
BG: I do think that the business context is quite critical. We cannot rely just on government to government, we need business to business, and we need people to people type things as well, such as student exchange. We need to keep the level of interaction up at every level, because the opportunity, from my understanding, is much lower if the relationship is based on just the top guy alone.
Z: Your life story is legendary to many people. Here are some questions from our young readers: What do you personally find as your greatest achievement in life and in work?
BG: I am super lucky. I’ve been in the area where things have been changing and been part of the digital revolution, the magic of software, the internet, the computer, and now the cellphone… so it’s been a great privilege. For me, I like to read and learn. There are always so many new things, like artificial intelligence, is now a big thing. We are making rapid advances. All the top companies and universities, rapid advances there.
It’s not a major thing, but I have some hobbies, like tennis and bridge. Actually I won my first bridge tournament last week, so that’s a small piece of excitement for me. I’ve been studying bridge for a while. It’s just a hobby. My team and I have really good result in the national tournament last week.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Where “Sapiens” examined the past, the new book, “Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,” attempts to answer questions about the future.
Harari, a professor of history, explained in an interview with the People’s Daily how he got the idea for “Homo Deus” in the wake of his first book’s success. It was readers who prompted Harari to shift his focus, as many fans of “Sapiens” wondered what the past could teach people about the future.
According to the author, his new book “focuses on the interaction between technology, politics, society and religion.” What effect will big data algorithms have on politics once the former knows our thoughts and beliefs better than we ourselves do? Harari asks. What will happen as automation and artificial intelligence close off traditional career paths? These big questions and others like them are the subject of “Homo Deus.”
First published in Harari’s native Israel and England, China is the third country to publish the book. Asked about his impressions of China, Harari called it “the most dynamic country in the world today.” In comparison to Western audiences, the author said that Chinese audiences have a greater hunger for knowledge.
“In the West, people are very curious of course, but in China I got a real sense of urgency from the people. It goes beyond mere curiosity,” he explained. “They have a deep yearning to understand the world. They are very open to new ideas and new ways of thinking.”
Of course, hard-pressed to avoid the topic of politics in the current climate, Harari also shared his thoughts on China’s unique perspective when it comes to global affairs. Pointing to the country’s 2,000-year history, which he contrasted with the much-younger U.S. and European Union, Harari suggested that China has valuable experience uniting very disparate populations—a skill that will prove essential if nations are to band together to fight global problems like climate change and poverty.
“During [China’s history], the Chinese have had a lot of experience in balancing the needs and interests of many groups of people living in different regions and under different climatic and economic conditions. This experience will be vital for the survival and success of humankind in the coming decades,” Harari predicted.
Harari’s interest in profound and potentially unanswerable questions began when he was still a teenager. He recalled the shock he felt upon realizing that his family didn’t much care about the meaning of life—that they were more invested in money, work and politics than the “big picture.” Harari promised himself that he wouldn’t get bogged down in what he thought of as “the mundane troubles of daily life.” In a way, both “Sapiens” and “Homo Deus” are attempts to make good on that promise.
Perhaps hoping to reach other young people with limitless curiosity, Harari said he is considering a children’s book for his next project, which would focus on the history humankind.
Then again, he modestly considered, “I am not sure I have the necessary skills to do that.”",'% artificial intelligence%'

In an interview with Global Times, the expert offered the example of a gamer playing the game at a beach in Sanya, a city in southern China's Hainan province. If the player is in an area where sensitive facilities are located, and if the player then uploads images from the game to the Internet, then the security of those facilities could be compromised.
A report on the site Ubergizmo said that some Chinese citizens are worried that Pokemon Go was actually developed by Japan and the U.S. to help search for Chinese military bases. The game potentially allows any netizen to glimpse areas where few people are normally allowed to go.
At the same time, the U.S. is also worried about military leaks caused by the game. According to a report by U.S.-based Stars and Stripes, the game caused several players to try to gain access to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, because virtual places in the game are superimposed over places in the real world.
Yang Yangzhao, a virtual reality expert from the China Academy of Electronics and Information Technology, explained that augmented reality (AR) is a live view, either direct or indirect, of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. This requires the support of many advanced technologies, including computer vision, multimedia, data processing and sensor fusion.
Yang said that virtual reality (VR) development is combined with that of AR. While VR is already being applied in many industrial manufacturing fields, AR is still in its early stages. In the future, AR could be used in the industrial manufacturing, machine design and military fields.

This discovery is due to the efforts of over 1,000 scientists from universities around the United Statesas well as in 14 other countries. Among them was a team of five Chinese scientists from Tsinghua University who worked on gravitational wave data analysis.
""It is an extremely exciting discovery, and our group dealt with data,"" said Prof. Cao Junwei, head of LIGO Scientific Collaboration research group at Tsinghua University. As the only member from mainland China in LIGO scientific collaboration (LSC), Cao's group focused on gravitational wave data analysis using advanced computing technologies to help ""purify"" the received signals.
In search for real gravitational wave signals, scientists had to damp out irrelevant vibrations caused by noise sources, which is no easier than identifying a Morse code tapped on a wine glass at a grand party bustling with noise.
The group applied a method of ""machine learning"" to the analysis, which originated in the field of artificial intelligence. It compared the signals in the gravitational wave channel with other channels, and the coupling of signals helped rule out irrelevant signals. That transformed the signal detection and identification into problems of data analysis and processing, which is a strong point of the Tsinghua group, Cao told Xinhua.
""In a long period of time, LIGO was not sensitive enough to see a passing gravitational wave. What we captured and processed are all noises. But it was no waste of time. The experiences helped LIGO upgrade and improve sensitivity,"" Cao said.
He noted that the observation of a gravitational wave fulfilled the prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity and opened a new window on exploring space.
It will also drive cutting-edge development of optics, engineering, computer science and many other relevant subjects, he said.
To accelerate its domestic research, Cao said, China should develop its own gravitational wave observatory, but before that, loads of work needs to be done.
Moreover, China should strengthen interdisciplinary cooperation as well as cultivate its own research personnel in the field on the basis of existing research, he said.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Artificial intelligence (AI), a technology that some fear could destroy humanity, has hit another milestone when Google’s game-playing system AlphaGo defeating a human master at the Chinese game Go, considered the world’s most complex board game. The machine won definitively, taking five out of five matches.
At the World Economic Forum at the Swiss resort of Davos, experts presented the future of artificial intelligence, which is expected to become the cornerstone of a technology-driven industrial revolution.
With AI, robots can understand language, read text, understand emotions and, more importantly, the ""next generation of robots"" may have similar human self-learning abilities, and be able to adapt to the environment. Some even predicted that at advanced stages of artificial intelligence the computer will surpass the human brain.

Two years ago, the famous physicist Stephen Hawking said success in creating AI ""would be the biggest event in human history, (but) unfortunately, it might also be the last,"" unless we know how to avoid this risk.
With machines getting more and more intelligent, humans attach more dependence on machines. Will artificial intelligence be reliable and controllable? Will robots in the workforce cause humans to lose their jobs? Will robots someday control human beings? It is normal that we are concerned about the development of artificial intelligence, but we do not need to be panic.
In fact, the development of artificial intelligence is rapidly advancing, raising expectations of radical changes and greater convenience in people’s lives. For example, technologies such as voice recognitions in smart phones and image identification in electronic payments. And robots work efficiently, tirelessly, and accurately on production lines.

Disruptive labor market changes will result in a loss of more than 5.1 million jobs from 2015 to 2020, according to a latest report by World Economic Forum (WEF).
The Fourth Industrial Revolution, which includes developments in previously disjointed fields such as artificial intelligence and machine-learning, robotics, nanotechnology, 3-D printing, and genetics and biotechnology, will cause widespread disruption not only to business models but also to labor markets over the next five years, according to the report, The Future of Jobs, published Monday by the WEF.
This trend will lead to a loss of more than 5 million jobs in 15 major developed and emerging economies, said the report.
The report predicts that in the next five years there will be a total loss of 7.1 million jobs—two thirds of which are concentrated in routine white collar office functions, such as office and administrative roles—and a total gain of 2 million jobs, in computer and mathematical and Architecture and Engineering related fields.

""In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before,"" wrote Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of WEF in his latest article called The Fourth Industrial Revolution: what it means, how to respond.
Compared with previous industrial revolutions, the Fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace, said Schwab. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.
According to a latest international survey, four out of 10 young people around the world worry that robot will replace them in the future workforce due to rapid development of technology.
Commissioned by Indian business and software services firm Infosys, the study surveyed around 1,000 16-to 25-year-olds in Australia, Brazil, Britain, China, France, Germany, India and the United States, as well as South Africa, where a smaller sample of 700 was polled. Young people in developed economies are more worried about their future jobs.
Nearly 80 per cent of interviewees think that it is a must to keep learning in order to gain competitiveness ahead of rapid development of technology.
Globally, while almost two-thirds of those queried said they felt positive about their job prospects, those in developing economies were far more optimistic than their peers in developed markets. In India, 60 per cent said they think they have the skills needed for their careers, just a quarter were similarly optimistic in France, the poll found.
The survey shows that nearly 50 per cent of interviewees from developed markets said that the education they received is not suitable for jobs.
According to Infosys Chief Executive Vishal Sikka, technologies have evolved far faster than what was thought possible even 10 years ago, while the educational system remains wedded to practices initially designed for agrarian societies 300 years ago.

China has become the biggest consumer of industrial robots, but domestically produced robots account for only 30 percent of market shares. Key parts rely on imports, which take up over 70 percent of production cost.
Industrial robots have recently been dominating the robot industry. Wang Tianran, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and an automation researcher, thinks that the demand for robots in China is seeing a rapid increase due to the rising cost of human labor. The use of robots can not only increase production efficiency but can also save on cost.
China became the biggest global robot market in 2013, and its sales volume accounts for a quarter of the global sales volume. Qu Daokui, President of China Robot Industry Alliance, said that China has over 30 big robot development areas and industrial parks. Hundreds of listed enterprises focus on robots and thousands more are robot-related.
Globally, robot popularity is measured by robot ownership per every 10,000 workers. Currently in China, there are 23 robots per 10,000 workers. That number exceeds 300 in Japan and South Korea.
China is in the process of working out its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for the robot industry. Made in China 2025 has listed robots and advanced numerically controlled machines in the top ten important fields that need a breakthrough.
As for the heavy dependence on foreign materials, development of artificial intelligence and internet technology will be of great use to smart robots, according to Wang.

Nearly half of all jobs in Japan could be stolen by robots or accomplished using artificial intelligence in the next ten to twenty years, according to recent speculation by Japanese and British researchers.
Will half the population face unemployment?
Japanese think tank Nomura Research Institute and Oxford University conducted a joint survey, which found that that computer applications could potentially impact 601 different occupations in Japan. A total of 42.8 million employees are engaged in these 601 occupations.
Researchers believe that if 66 percent of a job can be carried out using artificial intelligence or robots, it can be regarded as replaceable. The survey shows that 49 percent of Japanese employees could be replaced by computers.

Similar studies previously conducted by Oxford University show that 47 percent of all positions in the U.S. and 35 percent of positions in Britain could be done by robots.
Which jobs are likely to be stolen?
Occupations such as general clerk, taxi driver, cashier, security guard, building cleaner and hotel room attendant are easy for computers to take over because they do not require special knowledge or skills, researchers predicted.

On the other hand, occupations that need interpersonal exchange, including doctor, teacher, academic researcher, tour guide and beautician have a lower possibility of being taken over by robots.
However, Nomura Research Institute noted that the study did not consider the balance between supply and demand of labor forces involved in these occupations.

He made the remarks on the sidelines of the ongoing World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos.
""Well China's obviously got a lot of people, a lot of smart people. It's moved to not only have more people college educated, but lots of engineers, to raise the quality of those engineering skills. It's created a recognition that if people invent something that they can be rewarded for that, which is leading to all new sorts of companies. Not just the IT space, although that's the most visible, but also more and more in biology, robotics, those things, so China's going to carry its weight. ""

""There are a lot of great talents in China. You know, building up the educational system, you know, I think China has got a very bright future.

An algorithm called AlphaGo has beaten one of the 3,000-year-old game's best players called Fan Hui in a recent tournament set up by Google.
The game, which was first played in China and is far harder than chess, had been regarded as an outstanding 'grand challenge' for Artificial Intelligence - until now.
A computer programme has beaten one of the best players at what's described as 'the most complex game ever devised by man'. An illustration showing a half a traditional Go board and half showing computer-calculated moves is pictured above.
The result of the tournament, which the machine won 5-0, provides hope robots could perform as well as humans in areas of as complex as disease analysis, but it may worry some who fear we may be outsmarted by the machines we create.
The computer is now set to take on the world's best Go player with a cool $1 million (£701,607) prize pot up for grabs.
If the computer wins, its developer Demis Hassabis, boss of Google-owned DeepMind said it will donate the winnings to charity.
In the game, two players take turns to place black or white stones on a square grid, with the goal being to dominate the board by surrounding the opponent's pieces.
Once placed, the stones can't be moved unless they are surrounded and captured by the other person's pieces.
It's been estimated there are 10 to the power of 700 possible ways a Go game can be played - more than the number of atoms in the universe.
By contrast, chess - a game at which Artificial Intelligence (AI) can already play at grandmaster level and famously defeated world champion Gary Kasparov 20 years ago - has about 10 to the power of 60 possible scenarios.
Until now, the most successful computer Go programmes have played at the level of human amateurs and have not been able to defeat a professional player.
But the champion program called AlphaGo, uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy networks' to select moves.
The 'deep neural' networks are trained through a combination of 'supervised learning' from human expert games and 'reinforcement learning' from games it plays against itself.
AlphaGo was developed by Google's DeepMind and signifies a major step forward in one of the great challenges in the development of AI - that of game-playing.
The computer achieved a 99.8 per cent winning rate against other Go programmes and defeated the three-times European Go champion and Chinese professional Fan Hui in a tournament by a clean sweep of five games to nil.
Now the machine has beaten Fan Hui (pictured left) it will face the top human player - Lee Sedol (right) of South Korea – at a meeting in Seoul in March, with the winner to be awarded $1 million (£701,607)
Toby Manning, treasurer of the British Go Association who was the referee, said: 'The games were played under full tournament conditions and there was no disadvantage to Fan Hui in playing a machine not a man.
'Google DeepMind are to be congratulated in developing this impressive piece of software.'
This is the first time a computer programme has defeated a professional player in the full-sized game of Go with no handicap.
This feat was believed to be a decade away.
The computer will take on the top human player - Lee Sedol, of South Korea – at a meeting in Seoul in March, with the inner to be awarded $1 milion.
Mr Sedol said: 'I have heard that Google DeepMind's AI is surprisingly strong and getting stronger, but I am confident that I can win at least this time.'
In the game, two players take turns to place black or white stones on a square grid, with the goal being to dominate the board by surrounding the opponent's pieces.
The program took on reigning three-time European Go champion Fan Hui at Google's London office. In a closed-doors match last October, AlphaGo won by five games to zero (the end positions are shown)
President of the British Go Association Jon Diamond said: 'Following the Chess match between Gary Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue in 1996 the goal of some Artificial Intelligence researchers to beat the top human Go players was an outstanding challenge - perhaps the most difficult one in the realm of games.
'It's always been acknowledged the higher branching factor in Go compared to Chess and the higher number of moves in a game made programming Go an order of magnitude more difficult.
'On reviewing the games against Fan Hui I was very impressed by AlphaGo's strength and actually found it difficult to decide which side was the computer, when I had no prior knowledge.
'Before this match the best computer programs were not as good as the top amateur players and I was still expecting that it would be at least five to 10 years before a program would be able to beat the top human players.",'% artificial intelligence%'

The total GDP of Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mexico, Indonesia, and Turkey will exceed the total of the old Group of Seven.
New Normal is a term in business and economics that refers to financial conditions following the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the aftermath of the 2008–2012 global recession, and has been used in a variety of other contexts to imply that something which was previously abnormal has become commonplace. Now, 6 years later, the global economy still remains in the ""New Normal"" swamp. There is no sign of expected structural reform; on the contrary the global economy is becoming even more sealed. Most ironically, the person who coined the ""New Normal"" term, Mohamed A. El-Erian, has lost his job as well.
Based on the latest statistics from McKinsey, the level of globalization has still not recovered from the global recession, and financial flows are still less than 70 percent of the previous level. Debt is the ""weather vane"" of finance. Under the economic downturn, the level of debt in the global economy has been soaring, with sovereign debt getting steadily worse. According to the Geneva Reports, the total global burden of indebtedness represented 215 percent of national income in 2013, while in 2001, the number was 160 percent.
According to the World Economic Outlook published by the IMF, the seven new market economies will progressively surpass the seven old industrial countries. i.e. the total GDP of Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mexico, Indonesia, and Turkey will exceed the total of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, and US. Though this conclusion is also based on the algorithm of ""purchasing power parity"" (PPP), it still highlights the weakness of the developed economies as a whole.
If you assume that this is no more than another repetition of the old investment banking analyst saw - that the new Group of 7 will bail out the old G7 economy - then you are wrong. Compared with the past the growth rate of the new emerging market economies is slipping, but the developed economies are even worse — Japan in particular is struggling with its Abenomics, and Europe is becoming Japanized. The UK and the US are the only ones holding out any promise. What provides even more of a contradiction is that the powerful return of the US dollars from the United States' improved performance may be a strong hit on the other economies.
So what can be counted on for future growth? The last Golden Age resulted from globalization, loose regulation, cheap interest rates, and demographic dividends. But the key factor is the development of technology. The most typical example is the Information Revolution of the 1990s. Though the dotcom boom did not end well, great companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon etc. expanded the production-possibility frontiers of human economic life.
That is why short economic prosperity still strongly relies on the development of technology rather than on the possibility that the new G7 may surpass the old G7. And innovation will be the key to economic growth, whether it comes in the form of wearable artificial intelligence, 3D printers, or some crazy experiment that we haven't even heard of yet.

Liu Boyi, the product manager of Tami Intelligence, introduces their robot.
""The robot has plenty of facial expressions, and the screen installed in its eyes can give people a good feeling of interaction. And (it can) follow the human body, which means it can imitate (your gestures when) when you are in front of it. Most importantly, it can recognize if you are a man or a woman, and tell your age and whether you are happy, and the degree of your happiness. It knows all of that.""
Even though many robotics companies are seeking ways to reduce human labour, conference visitor Miao Jun doubts that will ever happen.
""Robots can never fully replace human labour. For example, from the old days, when each worker had a single sewing machine in textile mills, to nowadays when one worker has ten sewing machines, only people can control these machines. Artificial intelligence has its limitations, and cannot take the place of human beings, but rather, it can reduce people's repetitive labour.""

The life-like female robot has stolen the spotlight of the exhibition.
Visitors crowd around to take photographs and talk to her.
Assistant Professor of Osaka University Kohei Ogawa is one of the robot's creators.
He says despite the robot's physical features and capabilities, it's still a work in progress.
""Our final goal is creating some AI system out of showing intelligence by using this robot. But still it's difficult, for example, voice recognition system doesn't work, especially in this kind of noisy environment. So that's why practically this robot is useful for tele-operated medium. But in the future, of course we are gonna create some perfect AI system by using this robot. To know the humans, to create the humans, the both.""
The exhibition also shows trends for future technological development, making it a good place for investors to go for business opportunities.
Gao Runlong is an investor in the tech sector. The 37-year-old holds high expectations for Chinese robots and the future of the industry.
""Robotics will be more popular gradually, then robots can largely take place of human labour in families and business. So in the future world, there will be great changes in terms of intelligent manufacturing and robots. Let's wait and see.""

Climate change, artificial intelligence and genetic mutations are all set to transform our bodies in drastic ways, according to a recent video.
We could for instance, develop red eyes as our DNA mutates, and have darker skin as an evolutionary response to global warming.
'In the future nanobots - or tiny robots - will be suddenly integrated into our own bodies, enhancing our abilities,' it says
'No longer will we be limited by own own physiology, but truly become a mixture of biology and machine on the inside.'
Meanwhile, designer babies will cause future generations to grow into intelligent, attractive and physically people.
'But while that will make us better smarter, stronger and better looking, such genetic similarity, or lack of human diversity, leaves room for a single new disease of the future, to wipe out the entire human race.'
As global warming takes hold, humans will also be skinnier and taller, it predicts, as this body shape is better able to dissipate heat.
Our faces may also change dramatically, according to Dr Alan Kwan, who holds a PhD in computational genomics from Washington University in St Louis.
Genetic mutations may cause our eyes to turn red and give us superhuman abilities, the video claims
Dr Kawn has created a stunning series of images which display one possible evolution for the human race over the next 100,000 years.
Dr Kwan believes that key to our future evolution will be man ‘wresting control’ of the human form from natural evolution and adapting human biology to suit our needs.
As genetic engineering becomes the norm, ‘the fate of the human face will be increasingly determined by human tastes’ writes Dr Kwan, while foreheads will continue to expand as our brains continue to grow larger.
As man achieves total mastery over genetics, the human face will become heavily biased towards features that humans find fundamentally appealing: strong, regal lines, straight nose, intense eyes, and placement of facial features that adhere to the golden ratio and left/right perfect symmetry.

Google, part of Alphabet Inc, aims to launch the China version of its Google Play smartphone app store next year, according to people familiar with the matter, its first major foray in the market since ending localized product support in 2010.
The Google Play app store would be set up specifically for China, and not connected to overseas versions of Google Play, two of the people said.
A Singapore-based Google spokesman declined to comment.
Five years ago, Google pulled its major services -- including online search, e-mail and mapping -- out of the Chinese mainland due to disagreements on regulations.

""Google is in constant dialogue with Beijing as it seeks to better serve the country,"" said Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google, during his recent visit to the country in November.
One of the main reasons behind his China visit is to strengthen the links between the company and the country, according to Schmidt.
""About 500 employees remained on the company's roll after we left, and Google has lots of partners (in China) and we also have offices in the greater China region -- in Taiwan and Hong Kong,"" said Schmidt. ""The interesting thing is that Google never left China.""
The US company would use a successful app store as a launch pad to place other products and services in China, said two people familiar with Google's thinking.
They said, however, that the company has not settled on which product might come next.
Chief Executive Sundar Pichai and other top brass have made no secret that the company wants to get back into China, and Google Play would likely be its first foray.
But critics say Google has lost basically all ground in most of its major services, especially search and video streaming, to Chinese players.
For Google, having a product in China would be a symbolic gesture to show that the company values the market, said Shen Si, CEO of Chinese mobile advertising company PapayaMobile and a former Google employee.
""If they want to break the ice with the Chinese market then they have to pick a pretty important product to make available to the Chinese people and make it really localized,"" she said.
Google has had its employees working hard in China to lay the ground for the app store's launch, said one of the people with knowledge of executives' plans.
The US-based firm is hoping to launch Google Play in China some time after Chinese New Year in February next year, and before early summer, that person said. Another person at a company in China that works with Google said the store will go live in 2016.
The company hopes the app store will include payment options such as Alipay, the online payment service from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's finance arm Ant Financial Services Group, and Tencent Holding Ltd's WeChat Payment, said the person familiar with executives' thinking.
Spokeswomen for Ant Financial and Tencent declined to comment.

""The World Internet Conference is important [as we] all have a shared responsibility to harness the enormous potential of innovation for the benefit of global society as a whole,"" Schwab said during the opening ceremony of the China-initiated summit.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0, is the convergence of smart technology including artificial intelligence, robotics, 3D printing, nanotechnology, materials science, energy storage and quantum science, with the Internet. It is not just about advancing products and services, it is about changing whole systems, according to Schwab.
""No institution, government, business, or system is able to govern the Internet alone [...] we need a networked approach, an enabling platform to develop a globally shared view of how technology is reshaping our economic, social, cultural and human environments,"" Schwab said.
He pointed out that to ensure that global values, norms and standards keep pace with scientific and technological progress, the world needed ongoing, agile and results-oriented interaction between governments, international organizations and civil society.
""The historic Paris Climate Agreement last weekend actually stipulates [...]the importance of multi-stakeholder cooperation to address global challenges,"" he added.
The prerequisite of reaping the tremendous benefits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is a harmonious, open global ecosystem with the Internet at its core, according to Schwab.
He said he believed that China, the country with the largest -- and still growing -- number of Internet users, can, and should, take a particularly leading, constructive role in building the global scientific and technological system, as China had done just now in the global climate negotiations.",'% artificial intelligence%'

April Fools' Day is not all about pranks. China's Internet giant Baidu is dead serious about its plan? to be launched on April 1?to include science fiction writers in its research on artificial intelligence.
The Baidu Verne Plan involves setting up a consulting team to bring the world's best science fiction writers together with leading scientists in a quest to turn imagination into reality.
The project, named after French novelist Jules Verne, has already invited six people to be the first group of advisers in the team, according to Beijing-based Baidu.
The company said that some of Verne's imagination seen in his books in the 19th century, such as helicopters, had been realized in the 20th century.
Apart from Andrew Ng, Baidu's chief scientist, the other five advisers are science fiction writers. They include Liu Cixin, who last year became the first Asian author to win the Hugo Award for Best Novel for his book The Three-Body Problem, and David Brin, an award-winning author from the United States.
Baidu said in a statement that the advisers will receive updated information on how the company is developing certain technologies.
They will also be able to communicate with Baidu's research and development team to turn some of the ideas into products through brainstorming.
Liu Cixin told The Paper in an interview: ""This is an innovative organization. Many ideas, along with innovative work, will be born here. The project will focus on artificial intelligence, and there will be an opportunity for us to work with scientists once the project is officially launched.""
Baidu said the project is highly exclusive, open only by invitation.
It is in line with the company's ambitions, as its President Zhang Yaqin has said artificial intelligence is the foundation to empower traditional industries and make them smart. He told China Daily, ""Baidu has made some world-class achievements in the key subfields of artificial intelligence, such as image recognition, voice recognition, machine translation and self-driving cars.""
Artificial intelligence is viewed by many other Chinese companies as the next ""big thing"", especially after Google's AlphaGo artificial intelligence program beat a South Korean world-class Go player recently.
Industry insiders say computers are likely to replace humans in a number of areas.
Beijing-based Internet finance company Jimu.com said it is about to launch a service using robots to offer wealth management advice to middle-class clients.

It was difficult to imagine just 10 years ago how a robot could help you select projects instead of financial advisers when managing money, but nowadays artificial intelligence technology is being increasingly used in investment and wealth management services.
Internet-based equity financing and investment service provider InnoTREE Co Ltd on Tuesday launched a service using robots to offer equity investment advice to investors.
Ma Chao, founder of InnoTREE, said: ""The robot could first establish a database, which covers the investment and financing information of more than 130,000 startups, and then track and analyze the daily operation situation of these startups or their projects.""
Ma said the robot will analyze the business model of these projects, categorize and evaluate them, and finally select the startups that are worth making investments in through its modeling and calculation.
""The workload of a robot each minute is equivalent to the workload of an experienced analyst working for 40 hours. Its cognition level is same as an investment manager with three to four years of investment experience,"" said Teng Fang, co-founder of the company.
It is the first time that robots are being applied in the equity investment market.
Yi Jigang, president of Orient Jiyi Investment, a Beijing-based private equity firm, told China Daily that the amount of equity investment is very small, but has huge development potential.
""AI technology will make the equity market more effective and efficient,"" Yi said.
""AI technology won't shock the investment industry but promote it. People could make use of the technological achievements to devote more time and energy do other higher-level business, and improve working efficiency and value by virtue of advanced machine tools,"" Yi added.
Another Beijing-based internet finance company, Jimu.com, said earlier this month it was going to launch a service using robots to offer wealth management advice to clients.
It is possible that the machines will be able to calculate investment risk, predict investment yield and offer customized financial advice through deep learning and analyzing huge amounts of data, said Dong Jun, the company's chief executive officer.
Yang Fan, a researcher at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys International, told China Daily that ""AI technology could only play an auxiliary role in the equity investment market as a huge pool of fake information exists in the market and the machine couldn't identify its authenticity.""
Yang said that AI technology will not fully replace humans, but may help humans by doing low-efficiency and trivial jobs, which could save time and energy for humans to do more creative work, adding some high-risk equity investment should still be done by humans.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Beyond Xian’er, the temple itself is a top-level research institute with cutting-edge technology and talents from renowned universities.
Standing about 60 centimeters high and clad in a yellow robe, the robot was developed by the temple in cooperation with artificial intelligence experts, and is able to sense its surroundings and engage in basic discussions about Buddhism. The monastery also has its own IT and animation teams, both composed of monks who graduated from top universities like Tsinghua University and Beihang University.
For instance, Master Xianxin, who majored in computer science and graduated from the Beijing University of Technology, is the head of the IT team. He manages digital technology for the temple, as well as the information platform that he built with the help of volunteers.
Liu Zhiyu, a math whiz and recent graduate from Beijing University, gave up a full scholarship offered by the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the U.S. in order to become a monk at Longquan Temple.

In addition to the monks, there are also more than 300 volunteers living in the monastery, some of who also graduated from top universities and won prestigious math honors.
To become a monk in the temple, one has to start as a volunteer, serving in position suited to one’s specific skills. However, only the morally qualified volunteers are ultimately selected as monks.

Recently, a British teenager named Billy Whitaker had his epilepsy cured thanks in part to the efforts of a robot surgeon. With minute accuracy, the robot pinpointed the epicenter of Whitaker’s debilitating attacks and drilled electrodes deep into his brain to remove the tiny piece of seizure-causing tissue.
Whitaker’s case was not the first instance of robots successfully performing surgery. To qualify as a robot surgeon, a robot must possess three major items: sufficiently advanced software and hardware (a brain), a sensor (eyes), and electromechanical devices (hands).
The “brain” works similarly to our computers at home, but its operating system is usually optimized to increase the stability of its software. “Eyes” usually refers to features like pressure sensors and/or video image capture devices. The “eyes” are in charge of collecting information and transferring it to the “brain,” which then issues commands for the “hands” to perform.
Most medical robots today are based on “Leonardo’s robot,” a design originally completed by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century and rediscovered in the 1950s. Doctors sit in front of a screen and use a sort of joystick to perform surgeries. The most important feature of these surgeries is that doctors are able to adjust the scale based on specific needs, which is especially beneficial for delicate and hyperfine surgeries. However, these ”robot surgeries” are usually much more expensive than regular ones.
In addition to robot surgeons, there are also robot chefs and robot executives. With the rapid development and increasing use of artificial intelligence across many fields, it is likely that more and more robots will make significant contributions to humanity.",'% artificial intelligence%'

""Automatic driving technology is more complicated than AlphaGo [the computer developed to play the board game Go],"" Wang said. In Wang's eyes, the successful development of artificial intelligence relies on three things: calculating ability, big data and calculation methods. Currently, the company owns hundreds of thousand servers. The calculating ability of the super computer developed by the company is twice of that of Tianhe-1.
Taking advantage of artificial intelligence, Baidu’s driverless cars have already managed successful, fully automatic drives in a variety of road conditions, including urban roads, elevated roadways and expressways. The car will be tested in the U.S. at some point in the future, said Wu Enda, a chief scientist at Baidu.
Driverless cars are the most significant development so far for the company. A spokesperson has said that they hope to put the car into commercial use within three years, and to enter mass production within five years. However, whether the car will put into commercial use depends largely on cost. A car-based radar on the driverless car that finished testing last year cost 700,000 yuan.
Wang said the company is working with its partner, attempting to bring the cost of the radar down to less than 20,000 yuan within the next three to five years. So far, the cost has been lowered to under 500,000 yuan. Wang said that the cost of a driverless car will only be 20 to 33 percent of the cost of manned cars.

China's banking sector holds huge potential for information technology companies.
The IT expenditure of China's banking sector is expected to rise from 92.32 billion yuan ($13.58 billion) in 2016 to 135.13 billion yuan ($19.88 billion) by 2020, said Frank Fang, senior research manager of IDC at a forum held by the company in Beijing on Tuesday.
The compound annual growth rate of banks' IT spending is estimated at 10.2 percent from 2015 to 2010, he said.
He suggested IT companies to keep abreast with technological innovation and grasp the innovative needs of customers from the banking sector.
However, given banks' high demand for security, IT manufacturers wishing to have long-lasting success should ""lead the users half a step ahead"", he said, warning against hasty moves in applying innovations.
The banking sector's major IT demand lies in compliance and anti-fraud solutions, cloud computing, big data, blockchain and artificial intelligence, according to Fang.
The anti-fraud market is still in the initial stage. The market size was 560 million yuan in 2016 and is projected to exceed 10 billion yuan in the next three years, he said.
Cloud computing has entered a stage of deep application in the banking sector, said Fang. IDC data showed that the private cloud market in China's banking sector reached 3.55 billion yuan in 2016 and the market for cloud services came to 1.28 billion yuan.
The application of big data in the banking sector will be in a fast track during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020) to reach 10.57 billion yuan by 2020, he said.
The application of the blockchain technology has been expanded in the financial sector, but there is room for improvement in security and transaction efficiency, he noted.
The market size for AI in the financial sector is forecast to reach 3.79 billion yuan in 2020, over 368 million yuan in 2016, he said.

Kuaishou, a Chinese video sharing and live streaming app, has become popular among China's rural population as it brings them closer by allowing them to record and share their lives.
What makes Kuaishou distinct is its focus on ordinary people, not glamorous celebrities and stars who abound on mainstream short video and live streaming apps.
""The number of daily active users of Kuaishou has surpassed 40 million, creating millions of short videos via the UGC (user generated content) method,"" said Su Hua, its founder and CEO.
The next goal is to encourage rural folk to record and share lighter-vein videos.
For any social networking app, the key is daily active users. Considering the success of Instagram, Su believes there is still great potential for growing the number of daily active users of Kuaishou.
The APP is popular even in urban centers. Daily active users in first-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen number 10 million.
Stated differently, 30 million users, or more than 70 percent of users, come from outside first-tier cities.
And 87 percent of Kuaishou's users are from the post-'90s generation or the so-called millennials. ""We are devoted to recording the daily life of ordinary people, giving them a stage to express themselves,"" said Su, adding the app aims to improve the user experience and attract more new users.
The app would recommend personalized content to users based on their browsing history and preferences with the help of artificial intelligence technology and a sophisticated algorithm. ""We also pay attention to data confidentiality and user security,"" Su said.
Kuaishou was established over six years ago. The company is now exploring ways of monetizing its assets (user traffic). It believes online virtual tools, gifts, video advertisements, e-commerce, games and other value-added services could prove money-spinners.
Su said Kuaishou's ultimate goal, however, is not to commercialize the platform totally. ""However, excellent commercialization programs will make us strengthen team building, hire more talent, and optimize our products.""
In March, Kuaishou received 350 million yuan ($1.1 million) in financing. The funding round was led by Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. Last year, it received funding from internet search giant Baidu Inc and Sequoia Capital. Their investments valued Kuaishou at over $3 billion.
Apart from Kuaishou, the Su-led startup also provides two video-related apps, focusing on live broadcast assistance and short video, editing features.
Given its large number of short videos, Kuaishou feels the pressure to review all that content, to ensure it is safe, decent and compliant with existing regulations.
""As a video-sharing platform, we need to check the contents of uploaded videos in accordance with the national regulations, before recommending them to users,"" Su said.
""The pressure of manual review is huge. We have spent three years establishing our review system. The professional review team comes from television channels with rich work experience. We'll strengthen the monitoring of live-streaming content, and deal with users who disseminate inappropriate content, including pornography,"" said Su.

It will be the first attempt by an AI to tackle the world’s largest-scale exam.
The computer challenger, AI-MATHS, is an artificial intelligence program designed by Chengdu Zhunxing Yunxue Technology using big data and natal language recognition. Though labeled a robot, AI-MATHS is actually an assembly of over 10 servers, which jointly run an artificial intelligence system. According to the company, AI-MATHS will not only take the math exam used in most regions in China, it will also attempt to complete several provincial math tests.
Joining 9.4 million students taking the exam this year, the robot will begin the test after 5 p.m., when the test for students across the nation is already over. Like most students, AI-MATHS has prepared stringently for the gaokao. It completed 500 sets of practical exercises, including around 12,000 questions, said Lin Hui, chief executive of Chengdu Zhunxing Yunxue Technology.
This is not the first time the robot has attempted a math test. In February, it scored 93 out of 150 on a different math exam, a mark only slightly higher than the passing grade of 90. According to Lin, natural language recognition is the robot's biggest obstacle, as it lacks the ability to make lexical inferences.
“The robot cannot deduce the meaning of new words through context. For instance, the abbreviation for tangent can be ‘tan’ and ‘tg,’ but AI-MATHS can only solve problems containing ‘tan,’ as it has never encountered ‘tg’ before,” explained Lin.
Similar robots have previously been developed by researchers from other nations, but the results are not promising. Japanese scientists have abandoned efforts started in 2011 to make a robot that can score high enough on an entrance exam to gain admission to the University of Tokyo.
China has been working hard to develop a high-scoring robot to take on the gaokao.

The world’s No.1 weiqi (Go) player Ke Jie lost the contest against his artificial intelligence (AI) rival, AlphaGo, in the third and also final match of the summit on Saturday.
This match began at 10:30 BJT in Wuzhen, east China’s Zhejiang Province, with AlphaGo playing the black and Ke white.
Ke showed his brilliant weiqi skills as he said he will “fight till the end,” though he lost his previous two matches against AlphaGo on Tuesday and Thursday.
AlphaGo made the first “impolite” move as it did on Thursday – to put the black stone on the bottom-right corner of the weiqi board. It is a Chinese tradition that the first stone is usually placed around the top-right corner and this is what weiqi coaches always teach beginners.
“I think the black already wins,” said Nie Weiping, vice president of the Chinese Weiqi Association, and a Chinese weiqi legend, one hour after the match.
Just like Ke, Nie thinks AlphaGo is much stronger than any human player.
“I don’t think the match has any meaning because the huge capability gap between the two sides left no doubt who will win,” said Nie. “AlphaGo is a machine. The gap between human player and AlphaGo, for example, is like a race competition, in which we human players are like a bike or car, but AlphaGo is a plane, or even a spacecraft.”
Nie reckoned AlphaGo should be a coach for weiqi players as there is much to learn from the AI program's unusual moves in the three matches.
“I believe AlphaGo should be a coach for our professional weiqi players as a master to improve our weiqi capacity,” he said.
Although Ke fell behind fast in the beginning of the match, he fought hard to catch up with his AI opponent.
The margin became very small when the two players entered the endgame.
Ke and AlphaGo clashed hard on the last empty area on the board – the top edge.
The commentators tried very hard to guess what moves were to be made, but they were left surprised by the two sides.
During the endgame, AlphaGo chose to retreat in all places around the board, giving Ke some territory to keep the situation stable, as the machine was already confident about winning.
But Ke still chose to give up after struggling.
The match lasted over three and a half hours.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Zeng Haiyan, political commissar of the Ministry of Public Security's Criminal Investigation Bureau, said Saturday that the number of telecom cheating cases reached 630,000 last year, equating to 10 percent of all crimes across China.
""We need to establish a close cooperation with high-tech internet companies in order to deal with the different forms of crimes,"" she said.
Zeng added personal information and property were two key elements of cyber fraud, which generally did not have direct linkage with police.
Liu Zhenfei, chief risk officer of Alibaba, said the Alibaba Group provided clues of 9691 suspects, across 23 provinces in China, throughout 2016.
Liu added the company would also like to use its strength in data and technology to construct a safer society.
""The Alibaba Group has, so far, assisted police to find a major suspect who caused a teenage girl to have a cardiac arrest after she was cheated out of 10,000 yuan, over the phone, in August 2016,"" he said.
Qiandun, an application developed by Alibaba last year, identifies forged ID through artificial intelligences and big data, and blocks suspicious asset transfers in banks, internet companies and third party payment platforms, according to Liu.
""It reminds customers of phone calls, QR codes and websites they have accessed, which could be infected with viruses, in a cooperated project with the Ministry of Public Security,"" he said.

A Top Ten Black Technologies list has been released at the 2017 China International Big Data Expo in Guiyang, capital of Southwest China's Guizhou province, stating how innovating the data industry helped to build a stronger, more intelligent life.
Ma Fang, senior media relations manager of Shenzhen-based Royole Corporation, said the structure and 0.01 micrometers of flexible display, seen at the event, can be applied to mobile phones, tablets, personal computers, smart home devices and intelligent transportation systems.
Much like the model, the flexible keyboard, released and featured at the event last year, was transparent, light and thin. It could expand and downsize into a stick no larger than a pen, which was easy for journalists to write stories everywhere, Ma said.
""The mobile phone, which can be worn on the wrist, was also released in the United States in January,"" she said.
""The display will go into production by the end of 2017, and has an estimated annual output of 20 billion yuan.""
Ma added the company, Shenzhen-based Royole Corporation, recently signed a cooperation memorandum with China Southern Airlines and Shenzhen Bus, as an application of flexible materials in the aviation and automobile industries.
""There will be no buttons on the operating desk because orders of playing music, guiding roads or air conditioning can be given through touch control,"" she said.
Wang Hongan, software researcher of the China Academy of Sciences, added the black technology referred to innovative high technology, which was developed generally beyond common sense, and said it would potentially overturn the whole industry.
""The 3D commodity show of the JD Group was enrolled in due to the application of the augmented reality technology in its e-commerce platform,"" he said.
According to Zhao Gang, leader of visual and augmented reality business of JD, the image of a rice cooker could also be put into real-life circumstances, in order to see if a chosen color and size would suit a specific kitchen.
""Some online shop owners may beautify products, but the 3D technology can even help customers to its inside; which, thus, helps them to make decisions,"" he said.
Sun Xuhong, director of central air conditioner of Haier, said a driverless unmanned air conditioner, from the Haier Group, had also been significantly developed to detect the temperature of nearby people and could adjust itself.
""The unmanned control system, called Haier intelligent cloud, can design different operating process for companies due to the mass data collected from various industries,"" he said.
A big data service start-up in China, named Hydata, also developed lip-reading recognition technology, which featured a 70 percent accuracy rate for the Chinese language. It also had an 80 percent accuracy rate for the English language, and was on the way of industrialization, with public security departments, in some provinces.
The technological framework of human-machine emotional interference – put forward by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China Electronics Standardization Institute and Guizhou Xiao I Robot Technology Co in February – won the title of black technology in the artificial intelligence field at the 2017 China International Big Data Expo.
""In the future, we expect to make robots which will be able to learn the emotions of humans, just by taking part in fluent and natural conversations,"" Wang Hao, CTO of Xiao I Robot, said.

Li had an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency lately as the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China is drawing near. (Xinhua/Qin Qing)
HONG KONG, June 24 -- Hong Kong's wealthiest man Li Ka-shing said ""one country, two systems"" has provided the region with ""front row seats"" in the country's development, enabling it to participate in various national development plans.
Ahead of the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China, the 88-year-old billionaire, in the capacity of Chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings and CK Property Holdings, shared his perspectives on the implementation of ""one country, two systems"" in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
Before the return, Li Ka-shing served as a member of the Drafting Committee of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR. He witnessed Hong Kong's journey into a new era under ""one country, two systems.""
Hong Kong's return to China is an important landmark in our history, Li said, adding that the smooth transition eased the concerns of many people about theone country, two systems' as it allowed for the fostering of a mutual symbiotic relationship.
The ""one country, two systems"" principle epitomized the creativity and flexibility of the Chinese leaders, he said. Before 1997 when Chinese and British governments were in negotiations on Hong Kong's future, some foreign companies showed pessimism about Hong Kong's economic and social development after the return. However, Li was more optimistic about Hong Kong and the whole country and increased his investments.
""One country, two systems"" not only ensured the stability of Hong Kong after the return, it also created time and space for its people and businesses to thrive and evolve with a stable social foundation and structure in an increasingly competitive environment, said Li.
Li said ""one country, two systems"" offers Hong Kong ""front row seats"" in the country's development, helping it understand the country better and participate in various national development plans.
With policy dexterity, both Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland could stay competitive, enjoy multiple returns in a high economic growth age, said Li.
Commenting on Hong Kong's economic development during the past two decades, Li said Hong Kong's economy has been symbiotic and intertwined with the mainland.
""Hong Kong is rooted in China, the ebb and flow of daily needs, unique opportunities as well as our role as a financial bridge for China are all safeguarded under the 'one country, two systems',"" he said.
""One country, two systems' is a profound concept. If we cherish freedom and opportunities, we need to be mindful of the essence of mutual tolerance and respect under 'one country, two systems', "" Li said.
""It is Hong Kong people's duty to be engaged and to have faith, to develop our unique system together into a vibrant and civil society,"" he noted.
Born in Chaozhou in southern China's Guangdong Province, Li Ka-shing moved to Hong Kong in the 1940s and started his businesses from manufacturing plastics. According to Bloomburg's billionaires index, Li now remains to be the wealthiest man in Hong Kong and ranks the 22nd around the world.
He said many policies of the central government have been proven very successful in three decades of reform and opening up, which unleashed tremendous productivity and boosted immense growth.
Hong Kong's business sector has always valued every-blueprint for reform and had actively participated in them, he added.
Now the Belt and Road Initiative, in combination with innovation and past infrastructure investment, will certainly become another conduit of growth, Li noted.
Over the years, Hong Kong's overreliance on finance and real estate has been a concern about its future development. Some people worried that there was not enough space for the development of other industries.
In Li's view, high growth returns in the future will be innovative and tech-centric, and the government needs to make more efforts in boosting investment and promoting education and reform.
""This is the same for both the mainland and Hong Kong,"" he said.
The fifth term of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government led by Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor will be sworn in on July 1.
Li believed that the incoming SAR government will push forward more effective policies to advance social development and economic diversification.
A flourishing ""one country, two systems"" civic habitat requires human mind and spirit to interweave with responsibilities and reason, as well as the importance of self-discipline, he said.
The renowned tycoon who will celebrate his 89th birthday next month has kept a young mind with visionary investment choice and swift response to the latest achievement of the world's science and technology.
AlphaGo, an artificial intelligence computer program, has become a tech-star since last year for defeating all human masters in the board game Go, which used to be considered impossible for computer programs in decades.
Li Ka-shing's Horizons Ventures was one of the early-stage investors of DeepMind, the London-based artificial intelligence company which created AlphaGo.
""Actually, Hong Kong has many unique foundations to support innovation and technology, "" Li said during the interview, ""which have not been well tapped over the past several years.""
High housing price, the personal development of Hong Kong's young generation and Hong Kong's social mobility has been a major concern to both the government and society.
As an exemplary figure for operating start-ups, Li said Hong Kong has advanced significantly since 1997. ""With new technology and mindset, we need to gear up for the future. Learning to think differently is more important than ever.""
He believed that the clear winners will be those who know how to marry a high degree of creativity and discipline. ""We must make good use of creativity and imagination,"" Li said, citing the Analects of Confucius: ""it is the individual who can carry forward progress and development, not the other way around"".
Asked about what kind of life attitude the young generations should uphold towards the future development, Li Ka-shing said ""opportunities favor those with ambitions.""
Li quoted Albert Einstein to encourage Hong Kong's young people: ""Never give up on what you really want to do. The person with big dreams is more powerful than one with all the facts.""",'% artificial intelligence%'

According to Zhu Guang, Baidu’s senior vice president, the company will cooperate with the Agricultural Bank of China to launch a financial brain project, as well as to develop applications related to evaluations of clients’ credit and supervision of their financial risks.
“Based on Baidu’s big data and algorithms, we can [deduce] our clients’ ages and educational backgrounds with an accuracy rate of 90 and 85 percent respectively. By generating a financial portrait of our clients, we can attract more customers, which is crucial for our future plans,” Zhu was quoted as saying by Thepaper.cn on June 20. Zhu also noted that AI technologies can be used for identity recognition and data collection, which are vital elements for the development of the financial industry.
“Compared to humans, AI is more accurate in determining the authenticity of cachet and bills. At the same time, by analyzing and studying clients’ behavior and irregular trade events, AI can establish anti-phishing modes to avoid risk,” said Zhu.
Introducing AI technologies into the financial sector is not Baidu’s initiative alone. According to the Wall Street Journal, Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, is building an artificial intelligence engine to automate management of the company.

CHICAGO, June 30 -- The China General Chamber of Commerce - Chicago (CGCC) held its second annual gala celebrating relations between the U.S. Midwest and China here on Thursday.
The gala included an award ceremony recognizing individuals and corporations that have contributed significantly to increasing Chinese industry and relations in the Midwest.
The CGCC recognized corporations such as Boeing, SAIC USA, and Wanxiang for bringing industry, innovation, and jobs to the Midwest region.
BOOMING CHINA-U.S. TRADE
In his opening remarks, CGCC Chairman Ni Pin introduced that in the past 16 years, Chinese companies have invested 20.3 billion dollars in nine U.S. Midwest states, creating over 45,000 jobs.
China is the largest trading partner and the third largest export market for the United States. According to the U.S.-China Business Council, China is the fastest-growing market for U.S. exports, with services to China growing by 301 percent and U.S. exports of goods increasing by 114 percent from 2006 to 2015.
""These are exciting times for U.S.-China relations, and it is crucial that both sides continue working together,"" Ni said.
""I hope that this event can help provide positive outcomes for both the U.S. and China business communities, creating more jobs and trade to boost economic growth in both countries.""
100-DAY PLAN BETWEEN CHINA &U.S.
A ""New Era - Opportunities &Challenges in the U.S.-China Economic Cooperation"" forum was also held during the gala, which falls within the timeframe of the 100-day plan agreed on by Chinese President Xi Jinpingand U.S. President Donald Trump that focuses specifically on promoting U.S. export to China, boosting trade cooperation, and attracting Chinese investment into the U.S. Midwest region.
""The two leaders have pointed a clear direction and laid the foundation for China-U.S. economic cooperation in the new era,"" Chinese Consul General in Chicago Hong Lei said.
""The political and business communities from both sides have focused on deepening economic cooperation between our two countries, carried out in-depth and pragmatic exchanges of view, and achieved a number of positive results,"" he said.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has focused on increasing Chinese investment into Chicago during his time in office. Since becoming mayor, Emanuel traveled to China twice, signing economic agreements with eight Chinese cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Qingdao, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Chengdu.
""This agreement makes Chicago and the eight (Chinese) cities gateways for investment between the two countries. I've worked hard to make this agreement successful and I'm pleased we have seen record-breaking investment from Chinese companies each year since it was signed,"" Emanuel said.
Along with business opportunities, Emanuel made an effort to promote Chinese culture in Chicago.
""From opening two new tourism offices in Chengdu and Guangzhou, elevating Chicago's Chinese New Year celebration with the goal of making it the biggest celebration in the U.S., to hosting numerous Chinese officials, including Vice Premiers Wang Yang and Liu Yandong, I have worked to make Chicago as friendly to China as possible,"" he said.

Internet powerhouse Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has appointed a seasoned scientist at Amazon.com Inc to spearhead its efforts in artificial intelligence, a move that will propel its so-called ""NASA plan"" to double up on technology research.
Alibaba in March announced a major project at its first technical meeting in Hangzhou, to galvanize the group's technological capabilities, code-named NASA.
Since June, Ren Xiaofeng, former senior principal scientist at Amazon and a Chinese citizen, has taken on the role as chief scientist and deputy dean at Alibaba's Institute of Data Science and Technologies, its global research and development center, the company confirmed on Monday.
Ren is recruiting a world-class computer vision team at a fast-expanding site in Bellevue, in the United States.
That's according to Ren's updated resume on the website of the University of Washington, where he also serves as an affiliate assistant professor of computer science and engineering.
In his four years at Amazon, Ren was the lead scientist at Amazon Go, using computer vision and machine learning, to transform retailing. The research led to the launch of an automatic check-out system that eliminates unnecessary and annoying customer waiting.
Prior to Amazon, Ren also had deep experience in vision-related projects at Intel Lab, working on computer vision and its applications in activity recognition and monitoring, robotics, and human-computer interaction. Ren holds a PhD in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley.
Alibaba said that Ren's coming onboard indicated an accelerated pace to carry out the NASA project, proposed by founder Jack Ma in March, to boost the firm's technological capacity in 20 years.
Ma said at the time that to meet the group's strategic goal of serving 2 billion customers, creating 100 million jobs and enabling 10 million businesses to become profitable, Alibaba should invest in technological infrastructure featuring machine learning, chips, the internet of things and biometric identification, among others.
As a new entrant to the international cloud market, Alibaba is off to a good start, being included for the first time in a Gartner Inc report this month as being ""well-positioned to take on bigger players such as Amazon and Microsoft Corp"".
Since the start of the year China's tech majors have been plowing in billions of dollars into consolidating a technical arsenal and talent pool to outgun their rivals.
Search engine Baidu Inc hired former Microsoft executive Lu Qi as group president and rolled out its Apollo Project to help drive the development of autonomous cars.
Tencent Holdings Ltd is also betting on cloud technologies and AI, doubling its offshore data centers this year and identifying AI as being synonymous with its services.
Shanghai-based Gartner Research Director Sandy Shen said that Chinese tech firms were becoming a hot draw for talent globally, given the market fluidity, fast pace and the receptive attitude toward new technologies among Chinese consumers.",'% artificial intelligence%'

A robot is being designed to compete with 12th graders during the college entrance examination in 2017 and get a score qualifying it to enter first-class universities in China, according to Huaxi Metropolis Daily.
The robot will sit three exams, namely math, Chinese and a comprehensive test of liberal arts, which includes history, politics and geography, said Lin Hui, CEO of an artificial intelligence company in Chengdu. The company won the bid for the artificial intelligence program on the robot's math test from the Ministry of Science and Technology in 2015.
Like the other examinees, the robot will have to finish the exams during designated periods. Unlike the usual scene that sees 30 students sit in an exam room, the robot will take its exams in a closed room without anyone else present, except for proctors and a notary.
According to Lin, the robot will be linked to a printer before every exam, and the electronic examination paper will be put into the robot's program when the examination begins. The robot will be totally disconnected from the internet and will solve the problems with its artificial intelligence program. Finally the answers will be outputted through the printer.
It's believed that Chinese and a comprehensive test of liberal arts, rather than maths, will pose challenges to the robot, since questions in maths are objective with specific answers, while in the other test subjects, there are some subjective questions, such as the reading comprehension and essay-writing.
Lin said that the robot writing technique nowadays has been increasingly mature. With key information words, a robot can write an economic news report following the widely-accepted writing mode in Silicon Valley, while nobody could tell it was written by a robot, Li said.
From this point of view, the robot can analyze the topic of the writing session and complete writing. Though the essay may turn out to be an emotionless piece, that slightly affects the grade.
The robot is actually a touchstone for artificial intelligence development and the key technology of the robot lies in understanding language and reasoning, according to Fu Hongguang, who is in charge of the research and development of the artificial intelligence program required in the math test.
The robot is reportedly trying to qualify for admission to Peking University and Tsinghua University in 2020, and its counterpart in Japan is eyeing Tokyo University in 2020.
The robot is just one example of the boom in artificial intelligence after Google's AlphaGo beat a world-class player in the ancient board game Go in March.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Apple and Samsung supplier Foxconn has cut employees in one of its factories from 110,000 to 50,000. The company was able to reduce its labor costs thanks to the introduction of robots, a government official of Kunshan, Jiangsu province revealed.
Within one decade, 47 percent of assembly work will be taken over by robots, and the company already has one factory operating smoothly without lights, said Foxconn's chairman Terry Gou at a summit in Guiyang on May 25.
But Gou stressed that Foxconn will not cut all of its 1 million employees, because cloud maintenance and certain machines are still dependent on human workers to perform properly.
Nevertheless, with so many manual jobs being replaced by machines, the reduction of total employees is already obvious.
A survey by the Kunshan government shows that up to 600 local enterprises plan to utilize robots in the near future. Last year, 35 Taiwanese enterprises invested 4 billion yuan in artificial intelligence technology.
There are a total of 4,800 Taiwanese companies in Kunshan, accounting for 60 percent of the city's GDP. Kunshan is also the world's manufacturing center for laptops.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the best entrepreneurial opportunity in human history, and China has bountiful advantages in creating world-class AI companies, said Kai-Fu Lee, founder and CEO of technology incubator Innovation Works, venture capitalist and former Google China chief.
""In the next 10 years, most unicorns --- start-up companies valued at over $1 billion --- are bound to be AI companies. The technology will spawn huge market values once incorporated into financial, banking and securities services. Its application in the medical industry, like gene-based treatment and cancer diagnosis, are of great value to humanity,” Lee said on Dec. 6 at a seminar headed by 36Kr, a Chinese entrepreneurship service platform.
At the seminar, he commented that China’s excellent math and science education will provide bountiful brain power to AI development around the country.
“Among all the existing theses in the AI field, 43 percent are written by Chinese people. And we can rapidly train young talents to work in AI—that’s what our entrepreneurial platform, Innovation Works, is doing,” he said.
He noted that many traditional industries in China, including banking systems, still use backward algorithms that lag behind those of Western countries. The adoption of AI algorithms will improve the efficiency of such platforms.
Another reason Lee cited is that all Chinese Internet start-ups valued at over $1 billion, such as Chinese Q&A website Zhihu and leading photo app Meitu, are hiring artificial intelligence experts to update their operations.
“China has more such Internet start-ups than the U.S., and its large Internet user base means huge market potential,” he said. In 2015, the number of Internet users in China reached 780 million, which is 57 percent of the country’s population and twice the U.S. population.
“A few days ago I read an article about a letter a U.S. AI company wrote to President-elect Donald Trump, and it notes that the U.S. must face China’s rise in AI. It calls for more funds to be injected into the AI field in the U.S.,” Lee added.",'% artificial intelligence%'

A team at Lanzhou Petrochemical Polytechnic has invented a smart ""robot fish"" that can explore underwater realms, Chinanews.com reported on Nov. 30.
The robotic fish utilizes many advanced technologies, including mechanical electronics, sensors and artificial intelligence. It can be used for pipeline detection, hydrology, water quality monitoring, underwater rescue and more. The robot has won a number of prizes for its sophisticated craftsmanship and advanced technology.
According to Hong Zirong, supervisor of the team that built the robot, the majority of water pollution and logging problems are caused by pipeline ruptures or leakage. Research indicates that current pipeline detection technology has poor accuracy. This situation inspired Professor Hong and his students to develop a new technology that, unlike earlier technology, is able to examine pipelines from the inside.
The robot fish has high detection accuracy and sensitivity, but costs under 100,000 RMB. It can be controlled via both computer and mobile phone.

Ding Jiahui, one of the team's members, said that their professor's encouragement was very empowering. Gao Bo, head of the college, pointed out that the vocational education has overcome many of the shortcomings of traditional undergraduate education. Once the students enter the school, teachers guide them to grasp professional skills with a worker's attitude. Colleges then get feedback about students' post-graduation performance two to three years out, which supports a chain of quality education.
The college plans to introduce more technical teachers in the future to facilitate an environment of innovation and entrepreneurship, said Gao.",'% artificial intelligence%'

The journal lists a series of achievements China made in the aerospace sector while the US, Europe, and Japan suffered errors and failures in several space missions.
China launched the world's first quantum satellite in August and powerful new heavy-lift rocket Long March 5 in November. Its Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the world's largest radio telescope, was put into use in September.
It also highlights the two Chinese astronauts who spent one month aboard the Tiangong II space laboratory, in China's longest manned mission in October and November.
In genetic engineering, a patient with lung cancer at a hospital in China became the first person in the world to be treated with cells edited using CRISPR-Cas9, reports the journal, saying more application of the genome-editing tool is expected in the US and China next year.
In addition, research teams in China, as well as the UK and Sweden, have announced their intentions to use the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to optimize the use of embryos and to study human development, says the report.
The journal also recognizes the positive role of China in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. China signed the international climate agreement on Earth Day, April 22nd, 2016, and its top legislature ratified the agreement in September. The agreement, forged in Paris in December 2015 by representatives from 195 countries, came into force last month.
Other science events that shaped the year, as listed by Nature, include the announcement in February that researchers had detected gravitational waves, the outbreak of Zika virus and the following research, the artificial intelligence AlphaGo beating world-class human player Lee Sedol at the ancient game of Go, the development of assisted-reproduction techniques that mix DNA from three people, as well as the influence of politics and economic events on science.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Samsung's market share dropped by 14.2 percent in the third quarter of 2016, the company's worst performance to date, which has mainly been attributed to widespread battery explosions of Samsung phones over the past year. But there's no guarantee the brand will return to the top even if it survives its current crisis.
Meanwhile, Samsung's foreign peer, Apple, has also failed to maintain its earlier performance. With steadily decreasing sales, China has lost its title as Apple's second largest market. One factor in this decline may be insufficient innovation. Experiencing ""iPhone fatigue,"" more and more Chinese customers are now moving to domestic brands.
Since the first quarter of 2016, shipments of Chinese smartphones for the first time surpassed the totals of Apple and Samsung. Statistics from global market intelligence provider TrendForce showed that production of Chinese smartphones reached 600 million in 2016, accounting for 45 percent of the global total.
In addition to marketing, Chinese brands are also devoting energy to new technologies. For instance, some Chinese phone-makers are already leading in technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and 3-D images.
With the rise of Chinese brands comes frequent patent litigation between Chinese producers and their foreign competitors.

Kentucky Fried Chicken launched its first artificial intelligence-enabled store in Beijing on Friday, and the fast-food chain said it plans to further expand its layout of smart restaurants, creating more innovative and interesting dining experiences for customers.
With the cooperation of Baidu Inc, China's largest search engine, KFC started its first smart restaurant in the Financial Street area in Beijing.
At the store, customers are able to take pictures with a machine, which will recognize the diner's face, sex, age, mood and other features, then help to recommend suitable food and set meals and complete the ordering process.
""If the consumer visits the store again and takes a picture with the machine, it will be able to recognize his or her face and show the previous purchase history, remember the customer's dining habits, and help to place an order faster,"" said Wu Zhongqin, deputy director of the Institute of Deep Learning of Baidu Inc, which helped to develop the technology.
With another machine with an augmented reality, or AR function, customers are able to interact with the machine, change facial expressions by shaking their heads in front of the machine, take photos, and save them to their phones.
In April, KFC, an affiliate of Yum China Holdings Inc, started its first Chinese smart restaurant in Shanghai. The outlet is equipped with intelligent robot ordering, debuting the use of artificial intelligence in chain restaurants.
Zhao Li, general manager of Beijing KFC, said smart restaurants are not only about the cool hardware, but more about providing convenience to consumers.
""Our innovations make use of the cutting-edge technologies and they will help to attract more young consumers who prefer fashionable new things. The digitalization of the restaurant will also help to provide faster and easier services,"" she said.

Wang Changqing, director of the General Design Department of the Third Academy of the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, told China Daily in an exclusive interview on Thursday that future com-bat will require weapons to be cost-efficient and flexible. Therefore, the modular design will be a good solution, he said.
Wang's department has developed a large family of cruise missiles for the Chinese military.
""We plan to adopt a 'plug and play' approach in the development of new cruise missiles, which will enable our military commanders to tailor-make missiles in accordance with combat conditions and their specific requirements, he said on the sidelines of the 2016 Hiwing Forum in Beijing. The forum focused on artificial intelligence and unmanned equipment.
""Moreover, our future cruise missiles will have a very high level of artificial intelligence and automation,"" he said. ""They will allow commanders to control them in a real-time manner, or to use a fire-and-forget mode, or even to add more tasks to in-flight missiles.""
Chinese engineers have researched the use of artificial intelligence in missiles for many years, and they are leading the world in this field, he said.
Modular design is not new to the world's missile developers. The European missile developer and manufacturer MBDA displayed its CVW102 Flexis modular missile concept at last year's Paris Air Show. The system will allow missiles to be configured, according to mission requirements.
The CVW102 Flexis is designed for an aircraft carrier strike group. Missiles will be selected and assembled with different warheads, engines and guidance devices based on target information, according to a report on advanced missiles published by the Beijing Hiwing Scientific and Technological Information Institute, which researches aerodynamic missiles and unmanned systems.
A senior researcher at the institute who requested anonymity said a modular missile system is flexible and multifunctional. This will help manufacturers reduce development and storage costs and will enable a military user, such as an aircraft carrier, to prolong the operational range and duration of a mission.
""It is a promising approach in terms of the design of next-generation missiles, but we should also consider its technological complexity and production costs,"" he said.
Wang Ya'nan, editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said a modular missile will be capable of changing its destructive capacity, flight mode and range, and so is suitable for striking targets on the ground or at sea.
""However, engineers will have to make sure such a missile can be assembled within a very short period of time. Otherwise, the best time to engage the target will be missed,"" he said.

China’s leading ride-hailing app, Didi Chuxing, said on Monday that it will take over the Chinese operations of its U.S. rival, Uber, ending a ferocious battle over the Chinese market that cost both firms billions.
Together, the ride-hailing venture is worth about $35 billion, estimated the financial channel of People’s Daily Online. Uber will receive a 5.89 percent share of the combined entity, with preferred equity interest, which is equal to a 17.7 percent economic interest in Didi Chuxing, read the statement.
Although the two companies have not announced any detailed plans relating to future cooperation, self-driving and artificial intelligence algorithms are expected to be key to future operations.
On Monday, Travis Kalanick, CEO of Uber, posted on Facebook an email that he had send to his China team regarding the massive merger: “This merger paves the way for our team and Didi’s to partner on an enormous mission, and it frees up substantial resources for bold initiatives focused on the future of cities--from self-driving technology to the future of food and logistics,” wrote Kalanick.
Uber has never hidden its ambitions and excitement about a driver-free world. In February 2015, Uber, together with Carnegie Mellon University, announced the creation of the Uber Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The center focuses on the development of key technologies in areas of mapping, vehicle safety and autonomous technology.
On May 19, Uber tested its first prototype of a self-driving car on the streets of Pittsburgh. The car, a hybrid Ford Fusion, collected mapping data at the same time as it tested its self-driving capabilities. The car was equipped with radars, laser scanners and high-resolution cameras to map the details of its environment, according to a blog post written by Uber.
Didi, too, reportedly started working on a design for a self-driving vehicle. On June 4, 2015, Didi Chuxing signed an agreement with Beijing-based BAIC Motor Corporation Co. Ltd., one of China’s leading vehicle manufactures, to cooperate on self-driving cars.
As recently as July 20, the CTO of Didi Chuxing, Zhang Bo, said at an awards ceremony in Beijing that, “self-driving [cars are] an important strategic plan for the company.""
In May 2014, Apple Inc. invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing. Didi Chuxing, in exchange, provided Apple with rich data for its own self-driving car experiments.
The massive merger came after China announced the upcoming legal status of ride-hailing apps last week, allowing qualified private cars and drivers to get involved in the business.
Under the terms of the merger, Didi Chuxing will acquire Uber China’s brand, business operations and data. Didi and Uber will also become each other's minority stockholders, and each company head will join the other's board of directors.
However, according to Bloomberg, the two companies will maintain distinct brands, apps and business operations.
Since Uber launched its China operations a little more than two years ago, both companies have spent billions of dollars subsidizing their China operations, each one vying for dominance in the potentially lucrative market. Earlier this year, Uber announced that it was losing $1 billion annually in China, and Didi was thought to be dropping similar amounts of money.",'% artificial intelligence%'

The plan was announced at a summit on artificial intelligence and robotics in China's southern city of Shenzhen.
Maximilian Doemling, senior manager for highly automated driving at BMW Group, says the self-driving car will hit roads five years from now.
""If you're expecting autonomous function where you can be on the highway, pressing the button and the car is doing everything for you, like lane changing and driving and that stuff, and you can play with smartphone, and you're always safe, I mean we had the big announcement with Intel and Mobileye that we will have the i-Next in 2021.""
The ""i"" series, which has two existing models, are electric vehicles manufactured by BMW.
Self-driving vehicles is a field explored by quite a number of automakers as they seek new ways to boost sales.
Google and Apple are also said to be interested in this area.
IHS Automotive, an US auto market analysis company, estimates self-driving vehicles will account for around 10 percent of the global auto market in 2035.
However, it's been suggested by analysts there is still a long way to go to manufacture a completely reliable driverless car.

Fairfax Media columnist Michael Smith said on Saturday the hub based in Shenzhen near Hong Kong was its version of Silicon Valley, adding that Australia was ""dinosaurs in comparison"" to the Chinese progress in technology.
This is evident as five of the world's 14 privately-owned tech companies valued at more than 10 billion U.S. dollars were now based in China, Smith said quoting figures released by PwC.
""There is a real hunger here (in China) that Australia does not have. The Chinese look at Australians and think you are fat and lazy by comparison,"" an anonymous Australian working in the Chinese tech sector was quoted as saying.
A Huawei executive James Peng said the Chinese government's willingness to give incentives such as tax breaks coupled with its western-style market economy were the other reasons behind Shenzhen's success.
""You will see government efforts to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. What a lot of business people here like is that Shenzhen is a city where there is a recognition that businesses will do well but that some will fail. Failure is okay here, whereas Chinese provincial governments can't have companies failing,"" an unnamed Australian government official said.
Simon Lance, managing director of the China operations for global recruitment agency Hays, said Chinese tech firms like their counterparts in Silicon Valley, also find it challenging to recruit the right talent and have to offer pay rises of up to 25 percent and a career progression plan to get new employees on board.
""The thing that really strikes me about China is that it makes long-term plans ... 10-year plans ... you can set up an industrial park working on virtual reality or artificial intelligence almost overnight. Australians touring here are surprised at how high-tech the facilities are becoming,"" said Lance, an Australian who moved to China 15 years ago.
Drone maker DJI executive said the ability of Chinese companies being able to move fast and adapt was another reason for its success.
""Chinese tech companies used to copy what western firms were producing but then they started improving on it and now they are breaking new ground on their own,"" the unnamed executive was quoted as saying.
Even local banks in China were cashing in on the innovation fun.
Recently HSBC, one of the few foreign banks in China, launched a WeChat banking app which will let its customers transfer money to each other in two seconds.
In conclusion, Smith in his column titled ""China's tech sector leaves Australia in its wake"" believed that it was almost impossible for Australia to compete with China progress in the tech space.
""While there will be opportunities to utilise Australian talent and skills in China, the decision by Uber to pull out of China last month shows how difficult it is for foreign multi-nationals to get a slice of the action,"" Smith concluded.

The original prototype of the robot was debuted at the international Consumer Electronics Show (CES) early last year in Las Vegas.
The core business of the startup has then expanded to two main categories: Segway PT (Personal Transportation) and Segway Robotics.
An artificial intelligence system was installed in the robot to establish look, listening and speaking skills by Intel's computing unit and a variety of sensors, such as RealSense depth perception sensor and microphone array sensor.
On the hardware side, Segway Robot provides a hardware extension bay that connects to additional accessories.
During this year's CES, the company collaborated with BMW to deploy a customized parking assistant service for the latter's vehicles.

Sarah Zhang, senior director and head of Robotics Business Operations of Ninebot, told China Daily that the company is looking forward to working with more auto manufacturers to implement the service for drivers and also is willing to create customizedservice for high-end parking lots, similar to the charging pilesthat set up for Tesla drivers.
Pu Li, vice president of Ninebot Inc, mentioned that Ninebot provides an open platform and has unveiled a software developer kit (SDK) for developers to write their own applications for the new robot.
According to the company, the developers' project started in 2016 and has received thousands of applications from around the world for applying the authorization of development for Segway Robots.
Short-listed candidates chosen by the company will be qualified to purchase the developer version of the robot and receive technology support from Ninebot.
Pu noted that currently 70 percent of the registrations that come from developers, who are aiming to implement robot services, focus on industries such as general public services, medical care for elders, remote collaboration, games and entertainment, education and R&D on artificial intelligence.
""Speaking of business models, we want to accomplish a win-win beneficial success with third-party developers through application R&D and business cooperation,"" according to a written statement of the Ninebot Inc.
From February 10 to 12, the company will be a robotic platform sponsor of a healthcare robotics hackathon in Singapore.
The event will be hosted by MIT Hacking Medicine, originally a Massachusetts Institute of Technology student-run group that brings together innovative thinkers to solve healthcare's most pervasive problems.
Segway Robot will provide 5 Alpha robots for the teams who participate to the event.

AlphaGo, the AI player of the Go board game, hit the headlines again recently by achieving 60 straight online victories over more than 5o of Asia's top Go players.
AlphaGo, under the username ""Master,"" has defeated 59 world-class Go players on online Go platforms since December 29, 2016, including players from China, Japan and South Korea, such as Ke Jie, Yuta Iyama and Park Jeong-hwan. ""Master"" revealed that it is an AI on January 4, before a match with world-class Chinese player Gu Li in which it easily achieved its 60th victory.
""Thanks for the shock AlphaGo brought to the game of Go ... though I knew the identity of Master from the beginning, I still strongly wished that a human could win when watching the games,"" Ke Jie wrote on his Sina Weibo account on January 4.
Man behind the machine
Aja Huang, senior research scientist at Google DeepMind and the lead programmer of AlphaGo, was the one who moved the game pieces for AlphaGo during the matches.
His computer science and information engineering master's tutor at National Taiwan Normal University, Lin Shun-Shii, told the Global Times about Huang and AlphaGo on Thursday.
Huang started to learn Go when he was a child and continued playing into adulthood, which helped him develop AlphaGo, said Lin.
In around 2004, Huang began to develop a Go AI named after his wife Erica. Huang observed other similar programs and often discussed how to improve the Erica AI with Lin.
At the beginning, at competitions which pit Go programs against each other, Erica was an average player, but after gradual improvements, Erica became one of the best programs at the time and won Huang a gold medal at a Japanese competition.
Today, AlphaGo is still using some of the technologies pioneered in Erica.
Lin told the Global Times that AlphaGo was upgraded after playing historic matches against some top Go players in March 2016, when it was ""not so good sometimes.""
However, the AI won all 60 matches this time, which ""never happened in history.""
""No other program but AlphaGo could win 60 matches, so DeepMind, the developer, admitted that 'Master' was AlphaGo,"" Lin noted.
""Now that our unofficial testing is complete, we're looking forward to playing some official, full-length games later this year in collaboration with Go organizations and experts, to explore the profound mysteries of the game further in this spirit of mutual enlightenment,"" DeepMind announced on January 4.
Humans besting humans
Nowadays, with the rapid development of AI, people have mixed feelings about the technology - both hopes and fears.
Lin believed that ""it is an inevitable trend that humans cannot beat computers anymore.""
Our computer systems have become smarter and more powerful, and if the computers are better than you at the most advanced decisions, just let them do it, Lin said. ""You cannot help it.""
""This is a victory for human beings, not for machines,"" said Yu Kai, founder of the Institute of Deep Learning at Baidu Inc and CEO of Horizon Robotics, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
Yu also argues that as the algorithms controlling machines are created by humans, so if their orders are changed, the machines cannot win.
Yu believed that AI could become partners to humans and be used for production, education, medicine and transportation. The development of AI technology does not aim to replace mankind's with machines, but to extend human's abilities, he says. ""Technologies could help humans in the areas that we are not good at.""
When an AI surpasses humans in some areas, it is actually human beings surpassing themselves, said Wang Yuefei, chief of the Beijing-based State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, according to Xinhua.
""How could we benefit more people with these advances is the question that we should consider the most,"" Wang noted.

Chinese talent takes the digital world by storm; giants set to invest big time
When around 2,000 enthusiastic Chinese app-developers gathered for Google Inc's annual conference for their ilk in Beijing in December, they didn't allow sub-zero winter chills to dampen their enthusiasm for the event.
Suitably impressed, Scott Beaumont, president of Google Greater China, told the large audience at the Beijing Google Developer Day, the biggest such event in the Asia-Pacific region, that Google ""is here to know what Chinese (app-) developers want"".
The rapturous crowd cheered him on.
Its internet search engine may have been out of the Chinese mainland since 2010, but Google, like other global tech giants such as Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, has ambitious plans for the world's largest mobile internet market.
The California-based giant has launched a Chinese website for local app-developers and promised help to take their products global.
The developments excited Yan Peng, a Shanghai-based app-developer, no end. ""Finally, it's here. This is the best Christmas gift for me. I couldn't wait to ask for a day off to celebrate this moment.""
Such gushing praise was earlier common among Chinese consumers at the launch of much-awaited gadgets like, say, the latest version of the iPhone. But China is no longer just a humongous end-user market.
Apps developed in China are increasingly popular among domestic and overseas users. For instance, Clean Master, a junk cleaning app, has over 400 million overseas users. Bigo Live, a live streaming app, boasts 7 million monthly active users from Southeast Asian countries, all of whom came on board within three months.
Such developed-in-China apps abound these days. Call China an app-developer hub, if you will.
This new facet of China is not lost on the world's tech giants. ""China is now an indispensable part of the global developer community,"" said Ben Galbraith, head of product and developer relations at Google's developer product group. ""Chinese developers are responsive to new technology and known for high efficiency.""
The trend started a few years back. In 2014, China nosed ahead of India in terms of software developers. Out of 18.5 million professional and amateur software developers globally, China accounted for 10 percent of them, while India had 9.8 percent, data from International Data Corp, the US IT consultancy, show.
Data on the current scene is yet to emerge, but it is reasonable to assume that the mobile internet boom and China's digitalization push would likely have boosted the app-developer numbers significantly, said Sandy Shen, research director at Gartner Inc, a US-based technology research and advisory company.
Sensing future potential, Apple has decided to set up a research and development center in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, South China, later this year.
The US tech giant's Shenzhen announcement came after it set up its first China R&D center in Beijing in September last year. The work is still on and the total cost is expected to reach 300 million yuan ($44.6 million), and staff 500 employees eventually.
Shenzhen, which is an innovation hub, already houses over 100,000 developers for Apple.
During his May 2015 visit to Beijing, Apple CEO Tim Cook held extensive meetings with local app-developers. Apple has also invested $1 billion last year in Chinese ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing.
""Chinese (app-) developers are already technologically strong, and Apple will offer more help in the marketing side to help them venture into overseas markets,"" Cook had said.
China remains key to Apple in spite of tumbling iPhone sales. That's because the country beat the US to become the largest market for Apple's iOS app store last year, according to App Annie, an app-tracker.
In the third quarter of 2016, Chinese consumers spent $1.7 billion on the iOS app store, more than five times what they had spent just two years ago, App Annie said in an email.
Encouraged, Apple organized its first-ever app developer competition in China in October last year, to encourage university students to work on apps.
With spending rising and competition intensifying consequently in the domestic market, Chinese app-developers are venturing abroad.
Outbound Chinese app-developers often start with utility apps like cache cleaners, anti-virus offerings and data transfer tools, before testing waters in the content business, which ranges from social media, live streaming and mapping to mobile payment apps. Some have already had a good start, said Wei Fangdan, CEO of BaijingApp, an online community of more than 40,000 domestic app-developers who have global aspirations.
As of January 2016, they developed about 270,000 apps that were sold via Apple's iOS app store. By May-end, the app-developers earned more than $7 billion?and half of that came in the past 12 months, indicating strong growth momentum.
In the past two years, Chinese gaming and entertainment app-developers saw a 150 percent jump in revenue from the app store Google Play, Google said, without disclosing specific figures.
The United States, Japan and South Korea are the top three overseas markets for Chinese app-developers. Emerging economies such as India, Mexico and Turkey are new growth drivers, data from App Annie show.
Interestingly, Chinese app-developers are graduating to cutting-edge technologies like virtual reality and artificial intelligence.
Perfect World, a Chinese game developer, unveiled its first VR game ""Subnautica"" in March. The game enables consumers to be immersed in a virtual sea world and play with underwater creatures.
As of June 2016, the PC version of Subnautica generated more than $1 million in monthly sales. The firm is working on mobile VR games.
""There is an abundance of breakthrough innovation coming from China versus 'me too' technology we saw in the past,"" said Zack Weisfeld, general manager of Microsoft Global Accelerators.
In December, Microsoft said it would launch its mixed-reality headset HoloLens in China this year, so that more local developers can work on apps for the gadget. ""We believe China could be leading the world in terms of mixed reality. We are seeing more virtual reality activities here than in the United States,"" said Terry Myerson, executive vice-president of Microsoft's Windows and devices division.",'% artificial intelligence%'

In an email to Thepaper.cn, DeepMind wrote that they have been improving the calculation and learning abilities of the AlphaGo program. The recent spate of game-playing was actually preparation for official competitions later this year, the company said.
DeepMind was established in London in 2011 and acquired by Google three years later. It became internationally famous after launching its AI program AlphaGo. After the acquisition, DeepMind kept its London headquarters, where 140 employees currently work.
According to DeepMind, it plans to delve deeper into Go-centered artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, it will also focus on better calculations, social influence and the establishment of ethical norms.
""They want to enter the field of medical treatment, but the acquisition of medical data is quite costly,"" said Dai Wenyuan, CEO of technology company Fourth Paradigm. In response to DeepMind's intended expansion into the gaming industry, Dai noted that the development of AI in this field will be difficult.
In the past, DeepMind has explored a new method of refrigeration system management with teams from Google. Such technologies could save energy and help protect the environment. In addition, the company has cooperated with several U.K. hospitals in a bid to increase the accuracy of diagnoses and improve medical treatment.
""We hope to apply our technologies to the world to help solve the most urgent social problems, from medical diagnosis to environmental models,"" said Demis Hassabis, one of the founders of DeepMind.",'% artificial intelligence%'

""Master"" even beat a number of professional players from China and South Korea, including Park Jeong-hwan, Chen Yaoye and Lian Xiao.
Many advanced players attempted to beat the apparent expert out of curiosity, but no one was able to secure a victory. Chinese player Gu Li even offered a 100,000-RMB reward for the first player able to beat ""Master.""
Many people believe the mystery player is actually an artificial intelligence (AI) program. The coach of China's national Go team, Yu Bin, said that ""Master"" is not likely to be a human player because of its landslide victories against top players from around Asia. In addition to its overall easy victories, ""Master"" also makes very fast moves.
So far, no organization has claimed responsibility for the username. Meanwhile, some people believe that ""Master"" is an account secretly created by the player Ke Jie, who is currently ranked No. 1 in the world under Rémi Coulom's unofficial ranking system. On the last day of 2016, Ke posted a message on Weibo, saying that human players will achieve a new level with AI.

Researchers at Stanford University have created an artificially intelligent (AI) diagnosis algorithm for skin cancer that matched the performance of certified dermatologists.
By making a database of nearly 130,000 skin disease images and training their algorithm to visually diagnose potential cancer, the researchers tested the final product against 21 certified dermatologists. In its diagnoses of skin lesions, which represented the most common and deadliest skin cancers, the algorithm matched the performance of dermatologists.
There are about 5.4 million new cases of skin cancer in the United States every year, and while the five-year survival rate for melanoma detected in its earliest states is around 97 percent, that drops to about 14 percent if it's detected in its latest stages.
Diagnosing skin cancer begins with a visual examination. A dermatologist usually looks at the suspicious lesion with the naked eye and with the aid of a dermatoscope, which is a handheld microscope that provides low-level magnification of the skin. If these methods are inconclusive or lead the dermatologist to believe the lesion is cancerous, a biopsy is the next step.
In hopes of creating better access to medical care, the researchers set out to create an algorithm for skin cancer and reported their findings in this week's issues of Nature.
""We realized it was feasible, not just to do something well, but as well as a human dermatologist,"" said Sebastian Thrun, an adjunct professor in the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. ""That's when our thinking changed. That's when we said, 'Look, this is not just a class project for students, this is an opportunity to do something great for humanity.'""
Bringing the algorithm into the examination process follows a trend in computing that combines visual processing with deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence modeled after neural networks in the brain. ""We made a very powerful machine learning algorithm that learns from data,"" said Andre Esteva, co-lead author of the paper and a graduate student in the Thrun lab. ""Instead of writing into computer code exactly what to look for, you let the algorithm figure it out.""
""There's no huge dataset of skin cancer that we can just train our algorithms on, so we had to make our own,"" Brett Kuprel, co-lead author of the paper and a graduate student in the Thrun lab, was quoted as saying in a news release from Stanford University in Northern California on the U.S. west coast.
""We gathered images from the internet and worked with the medical school to create a nice taxonomy out of data that was very messy - the labels alone were in several languages, including German, Arabic and Latin,"" Kuprel said.
After going through the necessary translations, the researchers collaborated with dermatologists at Stanford Medicine, as well as Helen M. Blau, professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford and co-author of the paper. Together, the interdisciplinary team worked to classify the hodgepodge of internet images. Many of these, unlike those taken by medical professionals, were varied in terms of angle, zoom and lighting.
In the end, they amassed about 130,000 images of skin lesions representing over 2,000 different diseases.
During testing, the researchers used only high-quality, biopsy-confirmed images provided by the University of Edinburgh and the International Skin Imaging Collaboration Project that represented the most common and deadliest skin cancers - malignant carcinomas and malignant melanomas. The 21 dermatologists were asked whether, based on each image, they would proceed with biopsy or treatment, or reassure the patient.
The researchers evaluated success by how well the dermatologists were able to correctly diagnose both cancerous and non-cancerous lesions in over 370 images.
The algorithm's performance was measured through the creation of a sensitivity-specificity curve, where sensitivity represented its ability to correctly identify malignant lesions and specificity represented its ability to correctly identify benign lesions. It was assessed through three key diagnostic tasks: keratinocyte carcinoma classification, melanoma classification, and melanoma classification when viewed using dermoscopy.
In all three tasks, the algorithm matched the performance of the dermatologists with the area under the sensitivity-specificity curve amounting to at least 91 percent of the total area of the graph.
Although the algorithm currently exists on a computer, the researchers believe it will be relatively easy to transition the algorithm to mobile devices.",'% artificial intelligence%'

The Internet Plus concept was first presented by Premier Li Keqiang in March this year when delivering the government work report.
The action plan will integrate mobile Internet, cloud computing, big data and the Internet of Things with modern manufacturing, to encourage the healthy development of e-commerce, industrial networks, and Internet banking, and to help Internet companies increase their international presence, Li said.
The campaign will be very important to creating a new engine for economic growth, said Premier Li.
According to the action plan, China will push forward the integration of the Internet and traditional industries, fueling its expansion from consumption industries to manufacturing.
The action plan maps development targets and supportive measures for key sectors, which the government hopes can establish new industrial modes, including mass entrepreneurship and innovation, manufacturing, agriculture, energy, finance, public services, logistics, e-commerce, traffic, biology and artificial intelligence.
""The government aims to further deepen the integration of the Internet with the economic and social sectors, making new industrial modes a main driving force of growth by 2018,"" according to the action plan.
By 2025, Internet Plus will become a new economic model and an important driving force for economic and social innovation and development.
To this end, ""China will solidify its development basis by promoting Internet technology, infrastructure, [while] tackling the technological bottlenecks of industries and strengthening risk control.""
The government will add impetus to innovation. Enterprises will be encouraged to set up platforms and weaving networks for innovation. Industrial standards will be formulated for the integration of Internet and industries, while intellectual property rights will be protected.
China will clear barriers and lower limits for the market entry of Internet Plus-related products, optimize the credit system, draft a big data strategy and promote legal services.
Taking advantage of the China-proposed Belt and Road initiative, the government will encourage more Internet companies to increase their presence in the global market.
To meet the need of ""Internet Plus"" development, China will train, and make a better use of local and foreign talent, according to the action plan.
The government will provide finance support and tax references to key projects related to the Internet Plus plan, and encourage local governments to follow suit, while welcoming investors from home and abroad.
A ministerial joint conference system will be introduced in order to address important problems in implementing the action plan.
The cabinet also vowed to launch more pilot zones and encourage innovation demonstration zones such as Zhongguancun, the Chinese version of Silicon Valley.
Local governments were urged to come up with their own action plans.
""The favorable wind of Internet Plus is set to push the Chinese economy to a higher level,"" Li said earlier this year.
The action plan comes as China enters a crucial period for deepening reform and restructuring after the economy registered a growth rate of 7.4 percent in 2014, its lowest pace in 24 years.
China has the most Internet and cell phone users in the world. The country had 649 million Internet users by the end of 2014, and some 557 million used cell phones to access the Internet, according to the China Internet Network Information Center data.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been developing rapidly in China, according to experts and business leaders at an AI expo in Beijing. These authorities acknowledge that China has become a major AI power in the world, with speech recognition technology that tops that of any other nation.
Addressing the 2016 AI World Expo, which opened on Oct. 18 in Beijing, experts like Wang Feiyue, deputy director-general at the Chinese Association of Automation (CAA), and Yang Jing, founder of Beijing-based think tank AI Era, noted that China is becoming an increasingly prominent player in AI technology.
In 2016, two of the six fellows of the Association for the Advance of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) are overseas Chinese with foreign nationalities; another is a Chinese citizen. These numbers are especially dramatic given that the association has only made 15 Chinese people fellows since 1990, according to Yang.
At this year’s ImageNet - the Olympics of the IT world – the Chinese delegation came out on top in a variety of categories. The most prominent teams included those from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the No. 3 Research Institute Affiliated with the Ministry of Public Security and domestic IT company SenseTime, Yang added.
In the field of speech recognition, the software of Shenzhen-based company iFLYTEK boasted 95 percent accuracy, having won multiple championships at global speech synthesizer competitions, according to the company’s president, Liu Qingfeng. Liu also said that iFLYTEK’s software is now being used in BMW, Audi and Mercedes Benz vehicles worldwide.
“I believe that human-computer interaction platforms will be mainly controlled by vocals within the next 10 years, with assistive touch on screens or keypads. AI will enter everyday life as an essential along the lines of water and electricity,” Liu said at the expo.
Liu’s speech was broadcast in real-time on a screen using the company’s speech recognition software. Containing barely any mistakes, the transcription earned much admiration at the expo.
“We need Chinese people to get into this field both in technology and economy,” said Yoshua Bengio, head of the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, in a video clip sent to the expo.
“China holds a great advantage in its number of data pieces and user population, which can contribute greatly to AI development,” said Zheng Nanning, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering Sciences.
Zheng pointed out that AI development is especially crucial against the background of China’s ambition to become an innovative power by 2020, and a major science power by 2030. These goals are part of a strategic development guideline on innovative power that was issued by the central government in May.
(Yang Jing, founder of Beijing-based think tank AI Era, speaks at the expo.)
Stanford University’s leading AI scientist Fei-Fei Li predicted in a video clip sent to the expo that applications dependent upon perception, such as self-driving vehicles, industrial-use robots and augmented and virtual reality, will improve a great deal in the next five to 10 years. Li also thought that the industry’s focus would shift to cognitive AI.
At a sideline panel discussion about self-driving technology, IT giant Baidu announced that it would launch another road test of its self-driving car on the open road before the end of 2016, after a successful road test on a closed ring road in Beijing in 2015, according to James Peng, a chief architect working on Baidu’s self-driving initiative.
Peng admitted that a Level 4 road test, which lacks any human assistive control, will be especially hard in China, given the complex traffic condition that are complicated by jaywalking pedestrians and overly aggressive drivers.
Nevertheless, Peng boasted that Baidu’s self-driving car has 95 percent accuracy for pedestrian detection, and 99.9 percent accuracy in traffic light reading. Not only has the car passed China’s driver’s license examination, it also took an open road test in the U.S.
“It may take several decades before Level 4 self-driving can be realized. So far, human assistive control is unavoidable in almost all self-driving cars. But it is possible that China will create the best self-driving technology, despite the challenges posed by our traffic system, which is more complicated than those of other countries,” said Yu Kai, founder of Beijing-based AI company Horizon Robotics.",'% artificial intelligence%'

The Hangzhou government launched a new project, titled ""City Brain,"" with Alibaba Group and Foxconn Technology Group at the 2016 Computing Conference in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province on Oct. 13.
City Brain, an artificial intelligence hub, will use big data to help the city ""think"" and make decisions. It aims to build Hangzhou into a smart city with the ability to self-regulate and even interact with human beings.
""The core of City Brain will use the ET artificial intelligence technology of Ali cloud, which can conduct overall real-time analysis of the city, automatically deploy public resources and amend defects in urban operations,"" said Wang Jian, chairman of Alibaba's Technology Steering Committee.
The first step of the City Brain project is to collect data relating to infrastructure facilities including transportation, resources and water supply. From there, the partners will integrate data resources scattered around the city to navigate its ""neural network.""

According to Hua Xiansheng, a machine vision scientist at Ali Cloud, City Brain will be the only artificial intelligence system in the world that can achieve real-time analysis of city-wide videos. The transportation module has already been in use since September on Hangzhou's Shixin Road. Test data shows that, through the intelligent regulation of traffic lights, traffic flow on the street has improved 3 to 5 percent on average, and even up to 11 percent on some sections of the road.
""It's just the beginning,"" said Wang. ""City Brain is an unprecedented … experiment of bringing artificial intelligence into city management.""

China has long been seen as the""world's factory,"" churning out vast mountains of low-quality goods, but it is also considered a nation incapable of producing innovative products and ideas.
Now, this is beginning to change -- China is closing the innovation gap. From drones to artificial intelligence, the Internet to genetic engineering, innovative Chinese companies are leading global innovation and reshaping the country's technology and business landscape.
""There is a huge market with great opportunity,"" said Dai Xiang, co-founder and general manager of Enpower Energy, a manufacturer of aqueous ion batteries, which are cleaner, safer and more cost-effective than lead-acid batteries.
After 20 years in the United States, working as a senior manager for start-ups in Silicon Valley, Dai decided to go back to China and start his own business. To tap into the energy storage market, Dai and his friends set up Enpower Energy in 2012, with registered capital of 5 million yuan (about 746,270 U.S. dollars), in eastern Jiangsu Province.
""We get a lot of support from the local government,"" Dai said. Enpower Energy provides wind and solar energy storage solutions for households and businesses, and favorable policies allow it to attract talent and stay in Jiangsu for three years without paying rent.
The company, now with more than 50 employees and nearly 66 million yuan in total investment, plans to complete large-scale tests of its aqueous ion batteries by the end of the year and move to mass production in the middle of 2017, Dai said.
""We will become the world's second producer of aqueous ion batteries, after Aquion Energy in the United States, and we expect the company's business revenue to top 2 billion yuan by 2020,"" Dai said.
For much of China's economic boom over the past decades, labor and capital flocked to garment and mobile phone manufacturers. But now China is trying to move beyond just being the world's factory. Policy makers want the country's future growth to drain strength from new technologies, new ideas and new business models.
""To make China an innovative country and a leader in science and technology is what China must do now in pursuing development,"" President Xi Jinping said at the opening of the B20 summit in September.
High research and development spending, large numbers of engineering and science graduates and a wave of new businesses all signal that China has the potential to occupy the forefront of global innovation.
According to a global survey by Cornell University, INSEAD, and the World Intellectual Property Organization, China is now of the world's 25 most innovative economies.
China moved up four places from the 2015 survey to 25th overall, making it the first middle-income economy to break into the top 25, an area traditionally dominated by highly developed economies.
China's rise up the global innovation rankings has also been reflected in its businesses. It is now home to some of the world's most innovative companies, particularly in the fields of mobile technology, biotechnology and medical services.
In Forbes magazine's ""World's Most Innovative Companies 2016,"" which ranks businesses on their ability to be innovative ""now and in the future,"" Shanghai RAAS Blood Products ranked 16th.
A separate survey by Fast Company magazine ranked Huawei 13th""for taking the upper hand in the global mobile competition.""
Rising from a small workshop in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen in 1987, Huawei has grown into one of the world's leading manufacturers of telecoms equipment. Spending 10 percent of its annual budget on research and development, Huawei is the subject of particular scrutiny now that the government is encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship in the hope that creativity can spur a slowing economy.
Despite embracing innovation, China still lags behind on some issues.
Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei, said China must do more to protect intellectual property.
""Only if it protects intellectual property will China see more inventions. Ensuring originality is respected will attract more people into this field and help original ideas grow into industries,"" Ren said.
Dai Xiang believes the Chinese government needs further reform to cut red tape.
Calling it a painful process, Dai said it took him about eight months to register a joint venture with the Institute of Tsinghua University, Hebei Province.
""The administrative procedure should be simplified,"" he said.",'% artificial intelligence%'

It all started as instrumentation and later the intelligent machines emerged. Today, they have advanced to the humanoids. Call them the machine human beings or artificial citizens, and the import of their being would not be overstated. Or what else would you call a machine that seems to know more than you, just the substitute human being that can call you to order and direct that you are taking the wrong way, or better still ask you question if you would need assistance. It also talks your questions and respond or act accordingly.
Baby and robot
It would be apt to call them artificial citizens of the world and the creators have got millions of them all over the place. In China, such citizens are increasing in numbers. And to showcase the extent the makers have gone in introducing these beings into the ecosystem, they held the symposium in the outskirts of Beijing between October 21 and 24.
The ensemble was a deluge of inventions and creativity. The exhibitors came from even other countries and held the visitors and enthusiasts spellbound by the wonders they made.
In May this year in Beijing, the T3 – China, Japan and South Korea met in their annual Triennial Conference and the focus was advancing manufacturing and industrialization to high end index, especially the production of intelligent machines to effectuate production.
Maybe, with these ‘citizens’ spawning, the countries that worry about an ageing population that would run the society might spare the sweat and headache and just proliferate these machines to fill the demographic gaps.
Actually automation has been long with man from the automobile machines to the auto factory production lines. But it was later in the 1960s that artificial intelligence started taking the form of robotics exploiting the properties of the electromagnetic wave that enabled and fastened communication using remote sensors depicted in handheld phones and the internet. This aspect of technology has today permeated all sectors of the human society from defense to entertainment, from industrial use to home appliances, from factory production lines to service points at the airports and banks and even the hospital wards. Judging from the exhibition in Beijing, the robots rave just seems to be picking up now. The inventions keep coming in diverse ways, functions and uses.
At the entertainment aspect, many visitors to the fair were really captivated to see a stage peopled by robots that acted as comperes, chaperons, waiters and masters of ceremony. They direct and address the audience and even entertain in songs and dances. A particular podium had a display of a motley clan of dancing robots doing Michael Jackson dance steps and his moonwalk. Some sang and others jumped around in their stiff mechanical gait.
It was quite amazing watching a kid of less than two years play and dance about with a robot that was just his height. The baby was so excited to be in the company of this machine that blared out music he swayed to the rhythm akin to a child having a playmate at home. The tot was lost in the company of the little machine that looked like his age that for some many minutes he didn’t worry to look around for his mother.
At another stop, a contraption stood at the entrance to the pitch, the exhibitor explained that the machine is like an alternate member of a family. As the family goes out, the machine is left at home to watch and run errands. It monitors that nothing goes wrong like a stove left burning or a pot over fire or forgotten running tap flooding the home. In such situations or in case of fire outbreak, it helps in switching off a problematic appliance or turn off the stove and at the same time alerts the owner of the home through phone contact about what is going wrong. If it is what could be handled from a distance, through the activation of the machine, an intervention would be made.
Some other intelligent machines assist you at the banking hall, at the airport checking in terminal, at the hospital, at the hotel lobby and reception and also direct you when you don’t know what next step to take.
The exhibition also had the loose components that are pieced together to work the humanoids and artificial labour hands.

BEIJING, Oct. 26 -- China is set to be a key player in future innovative technologies, according to international investment banking group UBS.
The accumulation, utilization and application of big data will lead to the development of technological innovation in many fields, including artificial intelligence and financial technology, and bring significant investment opportunities, with China as a major player and market, said Amy Lo, Greater China head at UBS Wealth Management, on the sidelines of a technology CEO summit.
The world will see the growth of the Internet user population rise by 2.5 billion in the next ten years, mostly driven by increases in China, India and other Asian countries, according to Hyde Chen, director of the chief investment office at UBS Wealth Management.
The rise of millennials will underpin the continuous growth of technological innovation, especially in China, which has about 415 million young people, who have increased spending power and a growing interest in services related to the sharing economy, augmented reality and artificial intelligence, Chen pointed out.
Artificial intelligence is a key future trend that will impact the development of almost all sectors, according to Lo, who estimates the industry may soon see its revenue grew to 12.5 billion U.S. dollars, more than doubling that of 2015.
The rise in artificial intelligence could impact 50 million to 75 million low-skilled jobs, but it will also offer more creative jobs and investment opportunities, Chen said.
China has the world's largest online population and is the world's largest industrial robots market, however, its population dividend is running out as the country faces the troubles that come with an aging population.
UBS expects more mergers and acquisitions to help Chinese IT companies to complement their competitiveness and expand into overseas markets and grow into global tech giants.",'% artificial intelligence%'

These include steps like forming a world class industry cluster, nurturing 10 benchmark AI innovative enterprises with substantial influence, building six AI innovative application demonstration areas and launching more than 100 application demonstration projects.
""Shanghai's rich big data resources, wide application of smart technologies, sufficient industries, as well as its affluent research talents have laid a solid foundation for the development of the AI industry,"" said Chen Mingbo, director of the Shanghai Commission of Economy and Information Technology.
According to Chen, although Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, the trio of Chinese internet giants, are not based in Shanghai, the city could be the birthplace of AI unicorn companies, as its conditions are mature.
But to achieve such a goal, Chen said Shanghai should deepen the integration of AI and related industries including high-end equipment, integrated circuits, biomedical, and automotive to establish a set of innovation centers for intelligent manufacturing and industrial internet.
In addition, AI industrial clusters will be built across the city with different focuses like intelligent driving, intelligent robots, intelligent software and hardware. Tailor-made policies will be in place for attracting better talent both from home and abroad to Shanghai, and a strategic advisory committee for experts will be established to aid the city's AI planning and development, Chen said.

Seizing the Opportunity of a Global Economy in Transition
And Accelerating Development of the Asia-Pacific
Keynote Address by H.E. Xi Jinping
President of the People's Republic of China
At the APEC CEO Summit
Da Nang, 10 November 2017
Chairman Vu Tien Loc,
Leaders of the APEC Business Community,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,
Good afternoon! I am glad to come to Da Nang and meet all of you again.
Our region, the Asia-Pacific, has the biggest share of the global economy; and it is a major engine driving global growth. The business community is a primary contributor to growth, as it keeps exploring new ways of development. That's why during the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting over the last several years, I have always taken time to meet business leaders and discuss with you approaches and measures to address the challenges we face.
It has been 10 years since the international financial crisis broke out. Over the last decade, the international community have worked in concert to steer the global economy back to the track of recovery. Thanks to our efforts, the global economy is improving. Despite risks and uncertainties, global trade and investment are picking up, people are more optimistic about the outlook of financial markets, and confidence is growing in all sectors.
Development is a journey with no end, but with one new departure point after another. An ancient Chinese philosopher once observed, ""We should focus our mind on the future, not the past."" We live in a fast changing world, and the global economy is undergoing more profound changes. We must therefore closely follow the trend of the global economy, identify its underlying dynamics, keep to the right direction, and, on that basis, take bold action.
-- We are seeing a profound change in growth drivers. Countries are turning to reform and innovation to meet challenges and achieve growth. The potential of structural reforms is being unlocked and its positive impact of boosting growth of various countries has become more evident. A new round of technological and industrial revolutions is gaining momentum. Digital economy and sharing economy have registered rapid growth. New industries as well as new forms and models of business are flourishing. As a result, new growth drivers are being created.
-- We are seeing a profound change in the model of global growth. As time advances, development has taken on profoundly richer implications. The vision of innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all is gaining increasing public support. To achieve more comprehensive, higher quality and more sustainable development has become the shared goal of the international community. To implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and adapt to climate change and other challenges of a global nature has become an important international consensus.
-- We are seeing a profound change in economic globalization. Over the last few decades, economic globalization has contributed greatly to global growth. Indeed, it has become an irreversible historical trend. Against the backdrop of evolving global developments, economic globalization faces new adjustments in both form and substance. In pursuing economic globalization, we should make it more open and inclusive, more balanced, more equitable and beneficial to all.
-- We are seeing a profound change in the system of global economic governance. The evolving global economic environment demands more from the system of global economic governance. We should uphold multilateralism, pursue shared growth through consultation and collaboration, forge closer partnerships, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. This, I believe, is what we should do in conducting global economic governance in a new era.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,
Faced with the profound changes in the global economy, should we, the Asia-Pacific economies, lead reform and innovation, or just hesitate and proceed haltingly? Should we steer economic globalization, or dither and stall in the face of challenge? Should we jointly advance regional cooperation, or go our separate ways?
This is my answer: We must advance with the trend of times, live up to our responsibility and work together to deliver a bright future of development and prosperity for the Asia-Pacific.
First, we should continue to foster an open economy that benefits all. Openness brings progress, while self-seclusion leaves one behind. We the Asia-Pacific economies know this too well from our own development experience. We should put in place a regional cooperation framework that ensures consultation among equals, wide participation and shared benefits, build an open Asia-Pacific economy and promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. We should make economic globalization more open, inclusive and balanced so that it benefits different countries and people of different social groups. We should proactively adapt to the evolving international division of labor and actively reshape the global value chain so as to upgrade our economies and build up new strengths. We should support the multilateral trading regime and practice open regionalism to make developing members benefit more from international trade and investment.
The building of a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) is the long-cherished dream of the business community in our region. It was in response to the call of the business community that APEC leaders, for the first time, initiated the FTAAP vision in Hanoi in 2006. In 2014, the FTAAP process was launched in Beijing. We should get into action, fully implement the Beijing Roadmap, move toward the FTAAP and provide an institutional underpinning for growing an open economy in the Asia-Pacific.
Second, we should continue to pursue innovation-driven development and create new drivers of growth. The current global economic recovery is, to a large extent, the result of cyclical factors, while the lack of self-generating driving forces remains a nagging problem. To avoid the risk of the global economy entering a ""new mediocre"", we must sustain growth through innovation.
The new round of technological and industrial revolutions is unfolding before us. Digital economy and sharing economy are surging worldwide, and breakthroughs have been made in new technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum science. We in the Asia-Pacific cannot afford to be just onlookers. What we should do is to seize the opportunity, increase input in innovation, change the model of development and nurture new growth areas. We should promote structural reform, remove all institutional and systemic barriers to innovation and energize the market. We should implement the APEC Accord on Innovative Development, Economic Reform and Growth adopted in Beijing, deepen cooperation on the internet and digital economy and strive to be a global leader of innovative growth.
Third, we should continue to enhance connectivity and achieve interconnected development. Interconnected development is the best way to achieve mutual benefit and win-win outcome. We the Asia-Pacific economies are closely connected, and our interests are interlocked. Such an interconnected development will both open up new horizon for our own development, and create driving force for us all to achieve common development as partners. In 2014, the APEC Connectivity Blueprint was formulated. This Blueprint should guide our efforts to build a comprehensive, all-round and multi-tiered Asia-Pacific connectivity network. We should boost the real economy through the building of connectivity, break bottlenecks to development and unlock potentials. With these efforts, we can achieve coordinated and interconnected development.
In May this year, the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation was successfully held in Beijing. The Belt and Road Initiative calls for joint contribution and it has a clear focus, which is to promote infrastructure construction and connectivity, strengthen coordination on economic policies, enhance complementarity of development strategies and boost interconnected development to achieve common prosperity. This initiative is from China, but it belongs to the world. It is rooted in history, but it is oriented toward the future. It focuses on the Asian, European and African continents, but it is open to all partners. I am confident that the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative will create a broader and more dynamic platform for Asia-Pacific cooperation.
Fourth, we should continue to make economic development more inclusive and deliver its benefits to our people. The current headwinds confronting economic globalization is mostly generated by the lack of inclusiveness in development. Hard work is still needed if we are to bring the benefits of development to countries across the globe and people across our society, and thus turn our vision into reality.
Over the past few years, we have actively explored ways to promote inclusive development and have built strong consensus about it. We should deepen regional economic integration, develop an open and inclusive market and strengthen the bond of shared interests. We should make inclusiveness and sharing a part of our development strategies, improve systems and institutions to uphold efficiency and fairness, and safeguard social equity and justice. We should invest more in education, medical care, employment and other areas that are important to people's livelihood, and address poverty and the widening gap between the rich and the poor. We should reach out to disadvantaged groups, improve business environment for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and enable the workforce to better adapt to industrial transformation, so that everyone will have his fair share of opportunity and benefits.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,
As an old Chinese saying goes, a commitment, once made, should be delivered. Boosting development in the Asia-Pacific requires real actions by all of us members. As the world's second largest economy, China knows fully well its responsibility. Over the past five years, we have taken proactive steps to adapt to, manage and steer the new normal of China's economy and deepened supply-side structural reform. As a result, China's economy has maintained steady performance, and we are pursuing better-quality, more efficient, fairer and more sustainable development. Over the past four years, China's economy has grown by 7.2% on the average annually, contributing over 30% of global growth. China is now a main driver powering global growth.
We have worked hard to remove systematical institutional barriers that impede development through comprehensive reform. As many as 360 major reform initiatives and more than 1,500 reform measures have been taken. Breakthroughs have been made in key areas, and general frameworks for reform have been put in place in major sectors. We have sped up efforts to build new institutions of the open economy and transform models of foreign trade and outbound investment to continue the shift from quantitative to qualitative improvement in trade.
We have advanced theoretical, practical, institutional, cultural and other explorations to unleash new impetus for growth. China has become a huge platform where all factors and players of innovation converge to make a real difference. From infrastructure to various economic sectors, from business models to ways of consumption, innovation is leading the way.
We have pursued a people-centered philosophy of development to make our development more inclusive and beneficial to all. Individual income has registered sustained growth, outpacing GDP growth for many years. Income gaps between urban and rural areas and between different regions have been narrowing, middle-income group expanding, and Gini coefficient dropping. More than 13 million new urban jobs have been created every year for four consecutive years. Significant advances have been made in pursuing green development, resulting in considerable reduction in the intensity of energy and resource consumption and marked improvement in the ecological environment.
To lift all the remaining poor people out of poverty is a solemn commitment made by the Chinese government to the people. It is uppermost in my mind, and I have spent more energy on poverty alleviation than anything else. Over the past five years, I have been to many poor areas in China to pin down the causes of poverty and address them in a targeted way. As a result, decisive progress has been made in the fight against poverty. Over the past five years, we have lifted more than 60 million people out of poverty. The poverty headcount ratio has declined, and per capita rural income in poor areas has maintained double-digit growth. This has not come easily, and we are proud of what we have achieved in poverty alleviation.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,
China's development is an evolving historical process. Last month, the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was successfully convened in Beijing. Responding to our people's desire for a better life, the Congress formulated a guide to action and a development blueprint for China in the new era. It is envisaged that by 2020, China will turn itself into a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and by 2035, China will basically realize socialist modernization. By the middle of this century, China will become a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally-advanced, harmonious and beautiful. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people will embark on a new journey.
First, this is a new journey of deepening reform across the board and unleashing dynamism for development. To resolve difficulties and problems on the way forward, we must deepen all-round reform. We will focus more on solving problems, get rid of all outdated thinking and ideas and all institutional ailments and break through the blockades of vested interests to inspire creativity and vitality throughout society. We will develop a set of institutions that are well conceived, fully built, procedure based, and efficiently functioning and achieve modernization of China's system and capacity for governance. Next year, we will celebrate the 40th anniversary of China's launching of the reform and opening-up initiative. China's reform will cover more areas; and more and stronger steps will be taken in pursuing this endeavor.
Second, this is a new journey of moving with the times and exploring new model of development. China's economy is in a transition from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development. We will be guided by a new development philosophy, put quality first, give priority to performance and develop a modernized economy. We will pursue supply-side structural reform as our main task, work hard to achieve better quality and higher efficiency performance, and create more robust growth through reform. We will raise total factor productivity and accelerate the building of an industrial system that promotes coordinated development of the real economy with technological innovation, modern finance, and a talent pool. We will endeavor to develop an economy with more effective market mechanisms, dynamic micro-entities, and sound macro-regulation. All these efforts will make China's economy more innovative and competitive. We will promote further integration of the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence with the real economy, and cultivate new drivers of growth in digital economy, sharing economy, clean energy and other areas. We will continue to explore new mechanisms and pathways for achieving coordinated development among regions, promote coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze Economic Belt, Xiongan New Area, and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, build world-class city clusters and foster new source of growth.
As China works hard to pursue innovation and higher quality of growth, new forms of business will keep emerging, more innovations will be used, and development of various regions in China will become more balanced. All this will create a more powerful and extensive impact, present more opportunities of cooperation and enable more countries to board the express train of China's development.
Third, this is a new journey toward greater integration with the world and an open economy of higher standards. China will not slow its steps in opening up itself. We will work together with other countries to create new drivers of common development through the launching of the Belt and Road Initiative. We will adopt policies to promote high-standard liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment. We will implement the system of pre-establishment national treatment plus a negative list across the board, significantly ease market access, further open the service sector, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors. All businesses registered in China will be treated as equals. We will grant more powers to pilot free trade zones to conduct reform, and explore the opening of free trade ports. We will speed up negotiations with partner countries on the concluding of free trade agreements and investment treaties, advance the building of FTAAP, work for the speedy conclusion of RCEP negotiations, and endeavor to establish a global network of free trade areas.
In the next 15 years, China will have an even larger market and more comprehensive development. It is estimated that China will import US$24 trillion worth of goods, attract US$2 trillion inbound direct investment and make US$2 trillion of outbound investment. In November next year, China will hold the first China International Import Expo in Shanghai, which will provide a new platform for expanding cooperation in China's market among all parties.
Fourth, this is a new journey toward a better life for the people. To secure a better life for our people is what we aim to achieve in everything we do. We will ensure and improve living standards through development and meet people's ever-growing needs for a better life. We will continue to promote social fairness and justice to see that our people will always have a strong sense of gains, happiness, and security. We will continue to implement targeted poverty reduction and alleviation measures and ensure that by the year 2020, all rural residents living below the current poverty line are lifted out of poverty. Each and every one of the over 1.3 billion Chinese people should lead decent lives. No one will be left behind!
We will speed up institutional reform for ecological conservation, pursue green, low-carbon and sustainable development, and implement the strictest possible system for environmental protection. By 2035, there will be a fundamental improvement in the environment; the goal of building a Beautiful China will be basically attained. We will actively tackle climate change, and protect our common home for the sake of human survival. China's carbon dioxide emission is expected to peak around 2030, and we will make every effort for such emissions to reach the peak ahead of time. We will increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030. Once we set a target, we will not stop our efforts until it is met!
Fifth, this is a new journey toward a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind. The dream of us Chinese is closely connected with the dreams of people of other countries. Our world is full of challenges and the road ahead will not be smooth. But we will not give up on our dream. We will double our efforts and work with all others to build an open, inclusive, clean, and beautiful world that enjoys durable peace, universal security, and common prosperity.
We Chinese believe that peace is most precious and that there should be harmony among all nations. We are committed to peaceful development and we will remain an anchor for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. China will, guided by the principle of upholding justice while pursuing shared interests, actively develop global partnerships, expand the convergence of interests with other countries, and work to foster a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation. Acting on the principle of achieving shared growth through consultation and collaboration, we will get actively involved in reforming and developing the global governance system to make the international political and economic order more just and equitable.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,
All of our people in the Asia-Pacific deserve peace, stability and prosperity; and all of us in the region should jointly deliver a bright future for the Asia-Pacific. Partnerships based on mutual trust, inclusiveness, cooperation and mutual benefit: This is what keeps our big Asia-Pacific family together and ensures the success of Asia-Pacific cooperation. Let us take solid steps to promote cooperation and usher in an even brighter future for the Asia-Pacific.
Thank you.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Turnover of the Beats online store on Tmall, Alibaba’s e-commerce platform, is expected to increase during the shopping festival, but the operating officer of the store, Wu Miaoyu, does not see logistics as an issue.
The pre-allocation of the Beats products covers all the first- and second-tier cities, said Sun Wei, an employee of the Beats Tmall store.
According to Sun, Cainiao’s smart allocation system can realize a 99.99% accuracy rate this year, greatly reducing the number of mis-deliveries.
In addition, through artificial intelligence, Cainiao will, for the first time, realize real-time prediction of total shipment and transport capacity in order to avoid the busiest express delivery companies and thus possible delays.
After Beats’ cooperation with Cainiao, it only takes less than 24 hours for the customers to receive their orders.
On a recent promotion day, sales of Beats headsets on the Tmall store were several times higher than normal. However, Cainiao helped the store send out 70% of the orders on the same day, and 80% of the orders were received within 2 days.

In 2011, he surprised his circle by turning down offers to teach at top American universities, including MIT, in order to join the Beijing International Center of Mathematical Research. Having acquired a PhD from Princeton University, he became a rising star in algebraic geometry for his postdoctoral work at MIT.
Joining the Center in 2012, Xu has continued to keep his exuberant creativity. On November 4, 2016, to recognize his outstanding works on log canonical pairs and on Q-Fano varieties, and on the topology of singularities and their dual complexes, the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) awarded him the Ramanujan Prize for Young Mathematicians from Developing Countries. The International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) has invited him to deliver a 45-minute speech at their 2018 gathering to be convened in Aug in Rio de Janeiro. Hosted once every four years, the meeting is the world’s largest and one of the most important for the topic of mathematics.
Drawn by the Center’s competitive and free atmosphere, Xu’s colleagues are an array of eminent young scholars who are overseas returnees. Among them are topology expert Liu Yi, who holds a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley; Yang Shiwu, who holds a PhD from Princeton University and is a postdoctoral researcher in Cambridge, Massachusetts, specializing in general relativity and hyperbolic partial differential equation; Liu Ruochuan, who holds a PhD from MIT and studies p-adic Hodge theory; and Dong Bin, a world-leading expert in mathematical methods in medical image processing, to name just a few.

A visit to their office is just sheer delight and enjoyment. It might be the world’s quietest math academy. On the country’s distinguished campus of Peking University behind a small but dense forest north of Weiming Lake is an enclosure surrounded by grey walls. Seven Siheyuan, or courtyards surrounded by small houses on all four sides, are hidden behind the vermilion gate with copper knockers. The entrance leads to narrow, intersecting passages with towering old trees, rocks, and flowers, and each yard is an exquisite garden where birds occasionally visit and joyfully break the silence. It used to be an imperial garden in the Qing Dynasty (1616-1911), but was later transformed into Siheyuan for residential use.
Today, Siheyuan offers space, comfort, and quiet for Xu and his colleagues to pursue higher heights. “Math gives you the freedom and space to slow down, to concentrate on one small matter. It feels pure and classical”, Xu said.

Many mathematicians at the Center, including Xu, returned to China under China’s national recruitment program for innovative talents. Since 2010, China has rolled out at least four projects to attract young overseas high-level scholars in the fields of liberal arts and social sciences to work in China on a full-time basis.
One of the reasons that these projects are alluring is the ample research funding provided. A scholar recruited under the Thousand Talents Plan can receive a 1-2 million yuan ($150,000-$300,000) academic subsidy from the Chinese government, which according to Xu, a program awardee, “Is usually only available for faculty from renowned universities in foreign countries.”
Besides, researchers in applied mathematics at the Center are grabbing fat chances from the booming industrial sectors in China, as mathematical modeling is the foundation of a gamut of technologies from aerospace science to artificial intelligence. Medical image processing expert Dong Bin said he is working with arguably China’s best medical research center – the Peking University Health Science Center, as well as eight first-class hospitals in Beijing, which, according to him, is “a once in a lifetime chance” if he was working in United States. Many experts like Dong and companies have dedicated themselves to computer-assisted diagnosis technology, a computer system that can automatically interpret X-rays, MRI scans, and ultrasounds. Through the technology, people from China’s vast remote areas without access to fine doctors can get more precise diagnosis and treatment.

BEIJING, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- As China steps into a ""new era"" of development, the next chapter is beginning for the country's supply-side structural reform with a stronger focus on supply quality and economic rebalancing.
The reform, initiated two years ago, was set as the main task for economic growth at the recent 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), as the consensus was reached that China's economy has been transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development, and more attention must be paid to quality and efficiency than speed.
The past two years have been fruitful. Progress has being made on major tasks including cutting excess capacity, destocking, deleveraging, reducing costs and shoring up weak areas, laying the base for future reforms.
The advancing of supply-side structural reform has improved the supply-demand structure, and companies have enjoyed better profitability and lower production costs, said He Ping, statistician with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
In the first three quarters on this year, industrial companies with annual revenue of more than 20 million yuan (about 3 million U.S. dollars) reported a 22.8 percent of profit growth, faster than the 21.6 percent recorded from January-August, NBS data showed.
Efforts in supply-side structural reform have also lowered financial risks. At the end of September, the debt-asset ratio of large industrial companies had dropped 0.6 percentage points from a year ago to 55.7 percent.
However, more needs to be done in a changing economic landscape. Given the solid progress, more focus will now be put onto improving the supply system quality, which will be a key direction for building a modernized economy for the following stage, according to economists.
After a long period of breakneck growth, the Chinese market for major products has become oversupplied, and the demand steering the Chinese economy has shifted from product quantity to quality, according to Zhang Liqun with the State Council's Development Research Center.
""It is the most important and necessary change for a new development stage,"" said Zhang.
In the ""new era,"" instead of high GDPgrowth, China will pursue fairness and common prosperity, support underdeveloped regions and speed up technological innovation and industrial upgrading, according to Jiang Chao, chief economist at Haitong Securities.
China has previously set targets to double its economic size in the first two decades of this century, but no such targets were mentioned during the 19th CPC National Congress, which outlined a two-step approach to making China into a great modern socialist country.
""For the economy, the most prominent problem now is growth quality, and we need to address unbalanced and inadequate development through changes in quality, efficiency and growth drivers,"" said Yang Weimin, deputy head of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs.
China will accelerate the real economy, build itself into a manufacturer of quality products, while moving its industries toward the medium-high end of the global value chain and fostering a number of world-class advanced manufacturing clusters.
To bring forward the supply-side structural reform, strides are expected in both the upgrading of traditional industries and the development of emerging and high-tech industries, said Lian Ping, an economist at the Bank of Communications.
Industries like the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence will be further integrated with the real economy, with new growth areas and growth drivers to be fostered in medium-high end consumption, innovation-driven development, the green and low-carbon economy, the sharing economy and modern supply chains, Lian said.",'% artificial intelligence%'

With VR facilities reaching 8.2 million and the number of VR users surpassing 25 million, China’s VR market will account for 34.6 percent of the world’s total, CCID forecasted. The organization said that revenue in the sector will reach $10 billion globally this year.
The VR industry began to grow in 2016, and has been applied to a wide range of areas, including military, space and aviation, equipment manufacturing, medical science, education, tourism, e-commerce, and other sectors close to people’s life, said Zhao Qinping from the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a member of the Industry of Virtual Reality Alliance, China’s first government-endorsed VR industry alliance.
The government pays close attention to advancing VR technologies. In May 2016, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council released an innovation-driven development strategy to enhance research on VR technologies and apply VR to more industries.
A document to promote the healthy and orderly development of the internet released in January also stressed to step up efforts to develop key technologies such as VR, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality.
Talent shortages and lack of technologies for sustainable innovation are two difficulties to address, among others, Zhao said, adding that some start-ups are in need of policy and financial support from governments to attract more talents and investment and improve management.",'% artificial intelligence%'

During these five years, many internal and external events occurred, both with negative and positive influences. However, this all corroborated that it is essential to have adequate planning to face all kinds of adversities.
Externally, there were political, economic, and social issues that affected much of the world, either directly or indirectly. In working toward the goal of the “China Dream,” it was necessary to be united, determined, and competent.
Marriage is necessary for the success of any country. The government, the Party, the military, and the people must all be on the same page. In this way, it was possible to give all Chinese a ""moderately prosperous life"" and advance the goal of poverty eradication. Being close to the population and listening to their suggestions and complaints is fundamental to keeping the Party on the right course, and China has mastered this strategy.
Another critical variable was determination. Over the past few years, President Xi has emphasized and carried out essential steps toward deepening reforms.
This has been fundamental because besides from demanding political will, a great determination was necessary to change or alter wrong courses. The Chinese government has acted steadily, but other essential reforms remain for the next administration.
Finally, the last variable that contributed to the success was competence. We will now present the hypothetical Governance Model of President Xi Jinping, which we have consolidated into six main pillars. We will cite from recent political and economic achievements of the government.
The six pillars are: National Sovereignty, Deepening of Reforms and Rights, Educational and Cultural Development, Economic Development and Environment, Foreign Policy, and Creation and Monitoring of Institutional Norms.
In the last five years, I have highlighted the following about National Sovereignty. For example, the implantation of the modernization of the armed forces, the fair recognition of the value of the military, the development of deterrent and informatization capacities, creation of strong ties through the concept of duality, where military and civilians began working partnerships to generate products with higher added value.
The firm position was maintained on the legitimacy of Chinese Sovereignty in the South China Sea and the start of the strategic ""Grand Bay"" project that integrates Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau.
Regarding the deepening of reforms and rights, we highlight several actions to combat poverty and carry out tax reforms, reforms in the financial market, and changes in judicial bodies.
Regarding health, China has increased housing for the needy and has taken actions such as hospital reforms and creating better financial conditions for doctors and other health professionals
Regarding educational and cultural development, we highlight the effort to adapt education to the new world technological context. And regarding culture, there was the more significant dissemination of Chinese culture, improvements in the maintenance of cultural heritage, and the encouragement of the population to carry out tourism within China.
Concerning economic development and the environment, we highlight macroeconomic policies to equalize economic growth under the conditions of the ""New Normal,"" policies to encourage the services sector, facilitation of foreign capital investments, and development of innovation within the new context of the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"" among other necessary measures.
About the environment, the government reinforced measures to improve the situation through the deactivation or restructuring of ""zombie companies,"" the creation of more environmentally friendly locations, such as ""Ecological Buildings,"" and a firm policy against environmental polluters.
In foreign policy, the government acted in several areas, depending on the characteristics of the other country. For example, we highlight discussions on the issues of nuclear arms control, counter-terrorism, combating social inequality and eradicating poverty, the development of the grand world-wide strategic plan for Belt and Road, and other critical related actions.
Finally, subjects on the creation and monitoring of institutional norms showed us two critical actions. First, the policy of the government-party-population approach, which as we said was of utmost importance to China's success, and two, the government's vigorous activity against waste and especially in the fight against corruption.
What challenges and measures can be discussed and determined at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party for the next administration?
This question is incredibly complex, because of the planning required for the next five years of a country as great and important as China.
I will outline some challenges and some guidelines, which in my opinion, may arise at this critical meeting.
”""Innovation"" will certainly be one of the most important issues over the next five years. That's because, we know we're going through the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution,"" and its effects will be massive in most activities. Also, there are still enormous tasks for the Chinese government to look at and use their resolve to solve many challenges.
Regarding National Sovereignty, I believe that the insertion of ""cyber-physical"" systems will be intense in the processes of manufacturing equipment for national defense. Also, the Chinese government has determined that the development of military equipment, where possible, obey the principle of duality. This means that defense companies and private companies must work together more closely in the development of new equipment. In this context, ""cybersecurity"" should also have a special treatment, because its control will be fundamental to the sovereignty of any country.
I do not doubt that through ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,"" China will achieve its goal of building a moderately prosperous society, but it will be necessary to worry about some essential aspects.
For example, the process of deepening social reforms has very similar characteristics in any country in the world. First, improvements are more accessible to carry out, but once the process increases, the pace slows down, and more determined the government and Party will need to be to implement them.
An essential subject that must also be addressed will be how to prepare young people from their studies to their work.
In this new digital world, there isno way to follow old ways. The modernizations and demands of potential employers will have a very significant diversity and speed of change.
Therefore, I believestudents will need to be matched with the demand of companies. I only see one way. Educational institutions and companies must work together to create curriculum. With this, the number of unemployed young people will be reduced. The need for more vocational schools and startups in China also emerges.
In defining the growth of the economy for the next few years, not only should macroeconomic fundamentals be considered, but these technological and structural changes in productive modes should be predicted.
This is not an easy task, because every day new combinations of tools and sectors arise that focus on changing demands. However, I believe that among other areas of knowledge: nanotechnology, robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and energy storage systems, among others, should be the new priority.
Lastly, we must speak of measures for the tireless fight against corruption, which is being improved every day.

Scalpers who expected to rake in huge profits from the sale of Apple's iPhone X may think twice as prices of Huawei Technologies new ultra-high-end smartphone soared to dizzying heights as of Wednesday and made it one of the most expensive models on sale in the country.
Prices for the Chinese company's Porsche Design Huawei Mate 10, priced at 8,999 yuan ($1,360), rose to around 20,000 yuan ($3,023) in the country's leading online platforms of JD.com and Taobao.com, with the highest price peaking at 26,999 yuan.
In comparison, the price of its rival iPhone X on e-commerce websites was roughly similar or even lower than its official price tag.
A Beijing-based retailer on Taobao.com, who sells Porsche Design Huawei Mate 10 at a price of 18,500 yuan, said that the high price is due to the limited supplies of the device. ""A lot of people have made enquires, but very few have made the purchases,"" he added.
Since it became available in the Chinese mainland on Nov 15, Huawei has sold only a limited number of its ultra-high-end handset on its official online website at 10:08 am every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Chen Bo, a 38-year-old teacher, said that he failed to buy one from the official website even though he tried to buy after it opened for sales.
""I tried three times and it turned out that the type of phones were sold out within seconds. Jokingly speaking, it is harder to buy a Porsche Design Mate 10 than a Porsche,"" he said.
With a diamond black appearance and a custom Porsche Design interface, the 256-GB handset, as part of Mate 10 series, is targeted mainly at high-end consumers. It also boasts a slate of fancy artificial intelligence features such as intelligent photography.
""The ultimate reason is that there is an acute shortage of the Porsche Design Huawei Mate 10 handsets. The device uses an active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display screen from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. The short supply of such screens may pose challenges for Huawei as it tries to catch up with the top smartphone firms,"" said Jia Mo, an analyst at market research company Canalys.
Unveiled just a few weeks before the much-expected shipment date of Apple's iPhone X, Mate 10 series marks the company's efforts to challenge Apple in the premium segment.
""Given that the competition has just started, it does not mean that the Porsche Design Huawei Mate 10 will sell better than the iPhone X in the fourth quarter,"" he added.",'% artificial intelligence%'

The essay, published on Medium.com on May 6, describes the research by Wu Xiaolin and Zhang Xi as “deeply problematic, both ethically and scientifically.” Wu and Zhang, from Shanghai Jiaotong University, authored a paper titled “Automated Inference on Criminality using Face Image.”
The essay read: “This is especially unfortunate given that the correlation they measure — assuming that it remains significant under more rigorous treatment — may actually be an important addition to the already significant body of research revealing pervasive bias in criminal judgment. Deep learning based on superficial features is decidedly not a tool that should be deployed to ‘accelerate’ criminal justice.”
The essay was jointly written by Google scientists Blaise Aguera y Arcas and Margaret Mitchell, together with Alexander Todorov from the Social Perception Lab at Princeton University.
This is only the latest criticism of the controversial research. Previously, the paper by Wu and Zhang has been attacked both at home and by international scholars. In their paper, the two researchers detailed the results of computer tests that used 1,856 images of real people, which they claimed produced evidence for ""the validity of automated face-induced inference on criminality, despite the historical controversy surrounding the topic.”
In response to the latest round of criticism, Wu said that the team has no interest and lacks the social science academic background to offer an explanation of their results or discuss how they were formed. “Nor have we ever implied that we would put [the results] into law enforcement or the judiciary. They were forcing those intentions on us,” Wu told Thepaper.cn.
Wu also pointed out that the writers ignored their original introduction, which stated unambiguously that the intent of their research was not to discuss or debate societal stereotypes. “Rather we want to satisfy our curiosity about the accuracy of fully automated inference on criminality,” the introductory passage read.

“Last year, it was still like a human when it played. But this year, it is like a god of Go,” said Ke Jie, the world’s No.1 human Go player, after his defeat by Google’s AlphaGo Artificial Intelligence (AI) in their first game of Go - an ancient board game.
Last year, AlphaGo’s victory over South Korean Go player Lee Se-dol shocked the whole world. However, people are not so surprised by its win over the world’s best Go player this time. “The chance of Ke Jie to win is merely 10%, though he is the only human being to create this 10% chance on the planet,” said Hu Yaoyu, a professional Go player.
Many people are not familiar with Go, an ancient and mysterious intellectual game from China. According to the game rules, the number of possible games of Go is 10^768, while that of chess is only 10^120. These two are not even in the same order of magnitude. Therefore, many people regard Go as the last pride of Human Intelligence, the last dignity of human beings in the new era of AI. However, as AlphaGo won again and again, AI seems to have more possibility to “burst” on Human Intelligence.
Nevertheless, we don’t have to be so frustrated. Whether AlphaGo defeats humanity or not, the very last winner is still human as AI is an embodiment of human wisdom. As long as we develop it step by step, strengthen the management of regulations and techniques, it will only benefit and inspire mankind in the future.

The world’s No.1 weiqi (Go) player Ke Jie lost the contest against his artificial intelligence (AI) rival, AlphaGo, in the third and also final match of the summit on Saturday.
This match began at 10:30 BJT in Wuzhen, east China’s Zhejiang Province, with AlphaGo playing the black and Ke white.
Ke showed his brilliant weiqi skills as he said he will “fight till the end,” though he lost his previous two matches against AlphaGo on Tuesday and Thursday.
AlphaGo made the first “impolite” move as it did on Thursday – to put the black stone on the bottom-right corner of the weiqi board. It is a Chinese tradition that the first stone is usually placed around the top-right corner and this is what weiqi coaches always teach beginners.
“I think the black already wins,” said Nie Weiping, vice president of the Chinese Weiqi Association, and a Chinese weiqi legend, one hour after the match.
Just like Ke, Nie thinks AlphaGo is much stronger than any human player.
“I don’t think the match has any meaning because the huge capability gap between the two sides left no doubt who will win,” said Nie. “AlphaGo is a machine. The gap between human player and AlphaGo, for example, is like a race competition, in which we human players are like a bike or car, but AlphaGo is a plane, or even a spacecraft.”
Nie reckoned AlphaGo should be a coach for weiqi players as there is much to learn from the AI program's unusual moves in the three matches.
“I believe AlphaGo should be a coach for our professional weiqi players as a master to improve our weiqi capacity,” he said.
Although Ke fell behind fast in the beginning of the match, he fought hard to catch up with his AI opponent.
The margin became very small when the two players entered the endgame.
Ke and AlphaGo clashed hard on the last empty area on the board – the top edge.
The commentators tried very hard to guess what moves were to be made, but they were left surprised by the two sides.
During the endgame, AlphaGo chose to retreat in all places around the board, giving Ke some territory to keep the situation stable, as the machine was already confident about winning.
But Ke still chose to give up after struggling.

A Top Ten Black Technologies list has been released at the 2017 China International Big Data Expo in Guiyang, capital of Southwest China's Guizhou province, stating how innovating the data industry helped to build a stronger, more intelligent life.
Ma Fang, senior media relations manager of Shenzhen-based Royole Corporation, said the structure and 0.01 micrometers of flexible display, seen at the event, can be applied to mobile phones, tablets, personal computers, smart home devices and intelligent transportation systems.
Much like the model, the flexible keyboard, released and featured at the event last year, was transparent, light and thin. It could expand and downsize into a stick no larger than a pen, which was easy for journalists to write stories everywhere, Ma said.
""The mobile phone, which can be worn on the wrist, was also released in the United States in January,"" she said.
""The display will go into production by the end of 2017, and has an estimated annual output of 20 billion yuan.""
Ma added the company, Shenzhen-based Royole Corporation, recently signed a cooperation memorandum with China Southern Airlines and Shenzhen Bus, as an application of flexible materials in the aviation and automobile industries.
""There will be no buttons on the operating desk because orders of playing music, guiding roads or air conditioning can be given through touch control,"" she said.
Wang Hongan, software researcher of the China Academy of Sciences, added the black technology referred to innovative high technology, which was developed generally beyond common sense, and said it would potentially overturn the whole industry.
""The 3D commodity show of the JD Group was enrolled in due to the application of the augmented reality technology in its e-commerce platform,"" he said.
According to Zhao Gang, leader of visual and augmented reality business of JD, the image of a rice cooker could also be put into real-life circumstances, in order to see if a chosen color and size would suit a specific kitchen.
""Some online shop owners may beautify products, but the 3D technology can even help customers to its inside; which, thus, helps them to make decisions,"" he said.
Sun Xuhong, director of central air conditioner of Haier, said a driverless unmanned air conditioner, from the Haier Group, had also been significantly developed to detect the temperature of nearby people and could adjust itself.
""The unmanned control system, called Haier intelligent cloud, can design different operating process for companies due to the mass data collected from various industries,"" he said.
A big data service start-up in China, named Hydata, also developed lip-reading recognition technology, which featured a 70 percent accuracy rate for the Chinese language. It also had an 80 percent accuracy rate for the English language, and was on the way of industrialization, with public security departments, in some provinces.
The technological framework of human-machine emotional interference – put forward by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China Electronics Standardization Institute and Guizhou Xiao I Robot Technology Co in February – won the title of black technology in the artificial intelligence field at the 2017 China International Big Data Expo.

Zeng Haiyan, political commissar of the Ministry of Public Security's Criminal Investigation Bureau, said Saturday that the number of telecom cheating cases reached 630,000 last year, equating to 10 percent of all crimes across China.
""We need to establish a close cooperation with high-tech internet companies in order to deal with the different forms of crimes,"" she said.
Zeng added personal information and property were two key elements of cyber fraud, which generally did not have direct linkage with police.
Liu Zhenfei, chief risk officer of Alibaba, said the Alibaba Group provided clues of 9691 suspects, across 23 provinces in China, throughout 2016.
Liu added the company would also like to use its strength in data and technology to construct a safer society.
""The Alibaba Group has, so far, assisted police to find a major suspect who caused a teenage girl to have a cardiac arrest after she was cheated out of 10,000 yuan, over the phone, in August 2016,"" he said.
Qiandun, an application developed by Alibaba last year, identifies forged ID through artificial intelligences and big data, and blocks suspicious asset transfers in banks, internet companies and third party payment platforms, according to Liu.
""It reminds customers of phone calls, QR codes and websites they have accessed, which could be infected with viruses, in a cooperated project with the Ministry of Public Security,"" he said.
Wang Yihua, director of Alibaba's security department, said the data collected from the background of the app could also help the police to find sources of fraud.

Through the Apollo project, Baidu will build a collaborative ecosystem using its strength in AI technology to work with other companies to promote the development and popularization of autonomous driving technology.
The Apollo project provides platforms for vehicles, hardware, software and cloud data services and Baidu will share resources and capabilities in obstacle perception, trajectory planning, vehicle control, operating systems and other functions, as well as a complete set of testing tools.
Baidu will first introduce its autonomous driving technology in restricted environments in July, then expand to cars running autonomously on simple urban road conditions toward the end of the year. It will gradually introduce fully autonomous driving capabilities on highways and open city roads by 2020.
The company will work with partners with the best and most compatible vehicles, sensors, and other components and offer references and recommendations to participants.
""AI has great potential to drive social development, and one of AI's biggest opportunities is intelligent vehicles,"" said Lu Qi, Group President and Chief Operating Officer at Baidu.
Baidu has been investing in R&D for autonomous driving technology since 2015. It conducted successful road tests for its fully autonomous cars on the highways and roads of Beijing in late 2015 and finished open trial operations of its autonomous car fleet in late 2016 at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang Province, where over 200 guest passengers rode in the cars.
Baidu is the first among the major global autonomous driving players to open its technology and platform to the industry.

Addressing the Future Network Development Summit in Nanjing, Master Xiandu from Beijing's Longquan Temple said that rapidly developing technology is not in conflict with religion.
""As material and technological developments become seemingly infinite, men begin to consider spiritual demands, pondering inner peace, intelligence and the meaning of life. Technology without intelligence is like air carriers without eyes. Buddhists have also been seeking ways reform the way we preach the religion,"" said the master.
Longquan Temple is famous for its enthusiastic embrace of advanced technology, as many masters and monks are talented graduates in the field of science and technology. Master Xiandu holds a postgraduate degree in computer science, for example. Last year, the temple made a deep impression with the debut of its AI robot, Xian'er.
Master Shuguang from Foding Temple in Nanjing agreed that the fast development of internet in China casts a profound influence on Buddhism, as numerous Buddhist classics have been digitized and made available online for believers around the world.
Of the 32,000 Buddhist temples in China, some 10,000 use the internet for management, public communication and preaching.

China announced Saturday it would establish the Xiongan New Area in Hebei Province, as part of measures to advance the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. The New Area, about 100 km southwest of downtown Beijing, will span three counties that sit at the center of the triangular area formed by Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei's provincial capital Shijiazhuang. (Xinhua/Wang Xiao)
XIONGAN NEW AREA, April 12 -- Expansive economic zone in the making, Xiongan New Area is like a magnet for those seeking fortune.
Since an announcement was made April 1, people have crowded squares and streets in front of government buildings in Xiongxian, Anxin and Rongcheng counties, taking photos, exchanging information and looking for places to set up shop.
When a brief property craze died down, private entrepreneurs, internet engineers, scholars, restaurateurs and lawyers came here, joined by ministries and state-owned companies from Beijing. More than two dozen state-owned enterprises have pledged support for development of the new area.
Feng Chuan, 28, drove with his wife and a friend to the gates of Xiongxian County government on the weekend.
""I come to see for myself what Xiongan looks like now, and to understand why this area was chosen. I should be prepared for future opportunities here,"" Feng said.
Feng quit a well-paying post at Standard Chartered Bank to work with a software firm in Tianjin. ""Xiongan will become the capital of innovation in the future. We are looking for opportunities in the Internet industry,"" he said.
""I hope specific plans for the area will be made public as soon as possible,"" Feng added.
""We hope to start our own business and make the first bucket of money in our life,"" said his wife Bi Ying, giggling shyly.
A family from Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, about 1,000 kilometers to the southeast, drove here overnight to look into the possibility of opening a branch of their restaurant business here.
""People have to eat, right?"" said Yu Hongping, the father.
On April 1, China announced plans to create Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing. The new area spans the counties of Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin in Hebei, and is home to Baiyangdian, a major wetland in northern China.
Chinese leaders hope the new area will help address severe ""urban ills"" of traffic congestion and air pollution in Beijing, by curbing the capital's population growth and moving non-capital functions out of Beijing.
Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, called for efforts to build Xiongan into ""a demonstration area for innovative development.""
""General Secretary Xi has set the goal, we need to figure out how to realize it, how to innovate,"" an official with the preparatory committee of Xiongan told Xinhua.
""Xiongan is a move to adjust China's economic and spacial structure,"" said Xu Kuangdi, a renowned metallurgist and former mayor of Shanghai. Xu is also director of an experts council for coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.
""Xiongan represents a strategic effort to seek coordinated development between big cities and small towns. It is a ground to test new economic growth models and push for supply-side reform,"" Xu said.
Growth based on innovation, new ideas and methods, not exports or investment, is seen as a solution to China's growth conundrum. Top Chinese leaders have called for efforts to eliminate barriers to innovation and unleash productivity.
Experts said new rules regarding household registration and real estate management may be enforced in Xiongan, which is expected to be an example of a future city in China.
Xiongan New Area will initially cover around 100 square km and expand to 2,000 square km in the long term. Location of the central area and industrial layout, among other details, have yet to be published.
An official with the preparatory committee said they might welcome hi-tech industries such as 5G communications, bio-medicine, artificial intelligence and internet finance industries.
""There will not be large communities like Tiantongyuan in northern Beijing, no broad streets, but a green, organically connected and well-functioning place, a forest city, you might call it,"" the official said.
According to a government circular on Xiongan, the three counties feature geological advantages, convenient transport, an excellent environment and ample room for development.

Q:Thank you very much for your time. I hear that you will visit China soon. The first time you visited China was in 1994, still remember your first impression of China?
A: Every time I go, you know China’s advancing, whether it’s the buildings, or the people we are meeting with, or the technology. So it’s been exciting to keep going back and see how quickly it’s improving.
Q: You’ve made so many trips to China over the years. What do you think is the most significant change that has taken place in China?
A: I’d say two things. One is the miracle of Chinese economic development, lifting people out of poverty, building up the infrastructure, and developing world-class universities.
I remember almost every year somebody says, well now the China boom will reach its limits. And then 3 years later, they’ll say it’s reached its limits…Of course, even today there’s some strains and challenges, but still the growth is lifting people up. And it’s quite impressive.
The second thing I’d say is that China is embracing its role in the world more. Of course its first priority was the poverty in the country, but in parallel to that now China has joined the World Trade Organization, and China’s made really big commitments to Africa, both financially and about partnership. And in the region, the Belt & Road project is about tying together the economies for mutual benefit. So all of that has been exciting to see.
Q: What's the strategic focus of the Gates Foundation in China? How do you see China’s role in global development and governance?
A: The work of the Gates Foundation in China has two phases. One is the work in China itself, helping people with HIV, helping avoid people getting infected, working on tuberculosis and smoking (control).
Our second phase is a three-way partnership, where developing countries, China and the foundation find ways to work together. And taking some (of China’s) strengths like livestock vaccines; rice, including super green rice, where China’s very strong. So, (there’re) many examples. Ethiopia is a good example, where funding animal vaccine projects are what we are working on together. A group called CADFund is the local Chinese partner.
So the commitment to help other parts of the world is very important. That’s something that historically the U.S. has been very good at, but I’d be disappointed if the US cuts back. But it’s fantastic that China, because of its success, is joining in and in its unique way. So I am glad to see the leadership. For example,the $60 billion commitment made in Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation to help the African countries is a realistic acceleration under China's leadership.
The Chinese partnership will go and help to accelerate that improvement. And there are many lessons and things that China did very, very well, in the agricultural economy and manufacturing economy.
Q: Being a successful entrepreneur and philanthropist, you have made substantial contribution to communication and collaboration between the two countries. Based on your own experiences, how do you see the role that business collaboration plays in Sino-U.S. relations?
A: I do think that the business context is quite critical. We cannot rely just on government to government, we need business to business, and we need people to people type things as well, such as student exchange. We need to keep the level of interaction up at every level.
Q: Your life story is legendary to many people. What do you personally find as your greatest achievement in life and in work?
A: I am super lucky. I’ve been in the area where things have been changing and been part of the digital revolution, the magic of software, the internet, the computer, and now the cellphone… so it’s been a great privilege. For me, I like to read and learn. There are always so many new things, like artificial intelligence, is now a big thing. We are making rapid advances. All the top companies and universities, rapid advances there.",'% artificial intelligence%'

""We used to see artificial intelligence only as a way to improve our computing and processing abilities. But, actually, AI can use data for self study and make our rules,"" said Ma Huateng, chairman and CEO of Tencent, at the China IT Summit in Shenzhen on Sunday.
In March 2016, Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo scored a 4-1 victory over South Korean Go master Lee Se-dol in a five-round showdown. The machine's victory was noted by AI enthusiasts around the world.
Tencent developed its own AI program Jueyi, which has scored several victories in matches around the world.
""If we develop a simulator, define its parameters, let it fully explore, study and make mistakes, programs will make out how things work, far exceeding our imagination,"" Ma said.
Ma said Chinese IT companies were actively developing AI.
""Many companies are taking cities and seizing territories,"" Ma said.
Internet giant Baidu set up a national deep learning technology lab in Beijing in March. The lab gathered AI experts from Baidu, Tsinghua University, Beihang University and the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.
""The Internet is just an appetizer. The main course will be AI. In the future, machines will develop to a point where they can understand humans and their intentions,"" said Li Yanhong, chair of Baidu.
Baidu has invested heavily in machine-aided study, image recognition, voice recognition and driverless vehicles.
""AI will be a magnanimous industry and will last for a very long time. I'm certain that the industry will develop fast in the next 20 to 50 years,"" Li said.
At a separate AI conference in Beijing last week, Zhang Yongqiang, deputy director of Zhongguancun Management Committee, said the AI industry would see a ""new age,"" promoted by many government policies.
In May last year, the government made a three-year action plan to develop AI.
The industry market size was 23.9 billion yuan (about 3.5 billion U.S. dollars) last year, and will reach 38 billion yuan (about 5.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 2018, according to the China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
AI has been applied widely in security, finance and medical fields. DeepGlint is a Beijing-based company which has developed a smart video surveillance system, which will help police track suspects.
""If you upload facial images, or other information such as clothing, height, body size and car license plate number, into the system, it will scan hours of video for matches,"" said Zhao Yong, DeepGlint founder. ""It is impossible for police officers to scan millions of hours of video footage to locate a suspect, but it is possible for the system to do it.""
""Machines can do what people can't. We must make machines our best partner, rather than letting them replace us,"" said Jack Ma, founder of Internet commerce giant Alibaba. ""We shall not be worried about how much the Internet is impacting traditional business. Rather, we have to use Internet and AI to our advantage.""",'% artificial intelligence%'

Jia Jia was invited as a special reporter of the Xinhua News Agency to conduct the man-machine dialogue with Kelly on Monday. Jia Jia was unveiled in 2016 by Chen's robot research and development team at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. It took the team three years to research and develop this new-generation interactive robot, which can speak, show micro-expressions, move its lips, and move its body. (Xinhua/Guo Chen)
HEFEI, China, April 26 -- ""Jia Jia, I am really confused,"" Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired magazine and famous technology writer, said on Monday when his Skype conversation with Jia Jia, a Chinese humanoid robot, was interrupted by the network latency for a moment.
""Well, I said that all the time about life,"" replied Jia Jia, moving her thin and curved lips at the same time.
Impressed by the robot's answer, Kelly nodded approvingly in California, which also gave a relief to the research team across the Pacific Ocean in Hefei, east China. After that, the robot's performance began to improve as the internet stabilized.
Kelly's conversation with Jia Jia was part of the experimental dialogues initiated and live streamed by Xinhua. Besides Kelly, the experiment also involved influential artificial intelligence (AI) scientists from the United States, Europe and Singapore.
This conversation can be seen as a concise episode of Jia Jia's performance throughout the whole day, during which she managed to give satisfactory answers to most questions despite some mistakes.
""What Jia Jia did today was really challenging,"" Professor Chen Xiaoping, the leader of the Jia Jia's research team at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Hefei, told Xinhua after the experiment. ""Indeed, she made some mistakes. But her overall performance was good and had clearly improved compared with her last public appearance, so I am satisfied with it.""
He noticed that Jia Jia's performance improved greatly once the internet connection became better. The professor explained that most of the time Jia Jia needed to search the corpus in the cloud for suitable answers. During Monday's dialogues, video chats and live stream took up a large part of the bandwidth and thusly created several problems for the robot.
""We should have foreseen the problem,"" Liu Song, an assistant of Professor Chen, admitted. However, he also pointed out that despite the difficulties, Jia Jia managed to answer most of the questions, and some of the answers were surprisingly good: during her talk with Professor Bart Selman from Cornell University, Jia Jia humorously said that what she was looking forward to in her life was Friday and paycheck.
Professor Chen gave Jia Jia 70 points out of 100 for her performance, which, for reporters who witnessed all the dialogues, was an accurate evaluation. For those who had expected a ""Westworld"" android, Jia Jia is far from perfection. But no AI in the world could do substantially better under the same circumstances.
In fact, Jia Jia is one of the few robots in the world that have both high intelligence - for robots of course - and a very human-like appearance, which is why she has received so much attention from the scientific community.
Building a smart android that can move, think and talk like human beings is the holy grail of robotics and computer science. The human body is probably the most complicated and incredible entity we have seen so far. In designing human-inspired robots, machines are developed to the highest standard, which embodies the ambition and curiosity of the human race.
""We human beings should try to go beyond some traditional boundaries,"" said Professor Chen from the USTC, noting that what Jia Jia improved in Monday's dialogues was only a small step in the long path toward the destination but it was a step beyond the boundaries.
""Smart humanoid robots are basically an uncharted domain. No one can show us the right path. This is why it's so hard to continue improving Jia Jia,"" said Chen. ""But that's also why we have so much fun.""
Chen Zhang, a young engineer in Jia Jia's research team, also said that he was thrilled to see the improvement the robot made in the Skype conversations. ""Every step forward, no matter how small, is encouraging,"" he said.
""Every experiment has imperfections. But in some way, they light up our future path,"" the young engineer said, while looking at Jia Jia affectionately.
Jia Jia's engineers all said that it was an ineffable feeling to look at Jia Jia, who has alluring eyes, rosy and translucent skin, and long black hair braided in a traditional Chinese style. One could even see the light flickered in the artificial eyes for a moment as if she was alive.

BARCELONA, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Mobile World Congress (MWC) opened its doors here on Monday, showcasing the latest innovations of the mobile phone industry.
In the lead-up to the congress, the King of Spain, Felipe VI, said on Sunday: ""the mobile industry, which is at the heart of this Congress, is an expression of the best combination of cutting-edge technology and business efficiency, the most advanced communications services to offer better products in order to better meet the citizens' needs.""
This year's event has a new theme, ""Mobile, the Next Element"", which is based on the idea that mobile is more than everything (last year's theme), organizers said.
""The 2016 theme was 'Mobile is everything'. This year we want to go a step further. We were thinking about what is more than everything and the answer to that is mobile is elemental, it is part of everything in our lives, it is part of every new innovation,"" the chief marketing officer for the GSMA, a trade body which represents the interests of more than 800 mobile operators, Michael O'Hara said.
""Right now I have heard a lot about 5G, I guess we have more and more smart connected devices, Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality"", Stephanie Baghdassarian of U.S. internet technology research firm Gartner told Xinhua about what she expected of this year's edition.
During the weekend, several companies launched their new devices including Huawei, ZTE, LG, Lenovo Moto, Samsung, Blackberry and Nokia.

The new move will boost the country’s artificial intelligence (A.I.) progress.
The lab, approved by the National Development and Reform Commission, is dedicated to research and application of deep learning. The laboratory will focus on visual and sensory technologies, biometric identification, human-computer interaction, standardized services and deep learning intellectual property.
A national engineering lab in China, usually research and development entity established by enterprises, research institutions or universities, now represents an important part of the national scientific and technological innovation system. China had 167 national engineering laboratories as of last September.
China's progress in artificial intelligence research has attracted more limelight in recent years. In a report titled ""China’s Intelligent Weaponry Gets Smarter” published in early February, the New York Times commented that as consumer electronics manufacturing has moved to Asia, both Chinese companies and the nation’s government laboratories are making major investments in artificial intelligence.
A White House reportreleased last October said that Chinese scholars have published more research papers related to artificial intelligence than their American counterparts.
Baidu is not only one of China's top three Internet companies, but also a notable one in the world. Its CEO Robin Li, at the annual sessions of National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 2015, called for the development of artificial intelligence by introducing a plan called “China Brain”.
This engineering lab was launched less than two years after Li’s proposal, said Lu Qi, Baidu’s president and chief operating officer, adding that it revealed China’s leapfrog progress in artificial intelligence technology.
Lu, together with Wu Enda, chief scientist of Baidu, are heavyweights in artificial intelligence sector.
New York Times also linked Lu with the industry of the whole country, saying that “the advance of the Chinese was underscored last month when Lu Qi, a veteran Microsoft artificial intelligence specialist, left the company to become chief operating officer at Baidu, where he will oversee the company’s ambitious plan to become a global leader in A.I.”",'% artificial intelligence%'

As China's population declines, experts are calling for more research into artificial intelligence, big data and smart manufacturing to maintain an economic and industrial edge and to drive development.
China's rapid development means it's no longer unusual to see fixed robot arms working around the clock, performing simple, highly repetitive tasks, such as welding and moving components on a typical production line.
For the factories, robots make good employees; they work long hours, don't claim wages and never complain. Meanwhile, for an aging China, with its declining birth rate, robots, particularly the industrial kind, may offer a solution to a looming labor shortage that could potentially drag down economic growth over the long term.
The expected population shortfall has prompted widespread concerns that China will be over the hill before attaining its goal of becoming the world's leading economy. In response, the central government has relaxed the three-decades-old family planning policy that restricted most couples to one child.
Lu Jiehua, professor of sociology at Peking University, ruled out the possibility that the new policy will be the game changer that reverses the population decline, citing a change in public attitudes toward reproduction and family size.
By April, only 1.37 million of the 11 million couples eligible to have a second child had filed an application, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.
Official statistics showed that China's potential workforce, people ages 16 to 59, peaked around 2011, and has been in decline since. At the same time, the number of people working has been declining as a proportion of total population.
Last year, there were 916 million people between the ages of 16 and 59 in China, roughly 66 percent of the entire population. The proportion hit a peak of 74.5 percent in 2010, and has been falling ever since.
Lu's perception that robots offer a relatively simple solution to the problem is shared by other experts, such as Wang Weiming, deputy director of the Equipment Department at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
""The development of the robotics industry will solve the labor shortage in China efficiently, thus reducing labor costs for manufacturing industry,"" Wang said, adding that skilled workers only account for 13 percent of national employment, resulting in a shortfall of 33 million people.
Despite the fact that manufacturers are offering ever higher salaries, the majority of young people are unwilling to engage in labor-intensive occupations.
An industrial robot, however, can do the work of an average six skilled workers on two shifts on a production line.",'% artificial intelligence%'

The enterprise aims to apply deep learning to voice recognition, natural languages processing, machine translation, and data mining.
Voice Input, the app developed by the company, is able to convert voice messages in Chinese to English text messages, and English text messages into Chinese voice messages. It can also understand different Chinese dialects.
Apart from phone applications, iFlytek is committed to developing WIT 120.
The enterprise established cooperation with the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, inputting hospital medical records using voice recognition and inputting technology. The two also announced to set up a research center to jointly push forward the application of AI in basic medical and clinic research.
In addition, the enterprise established the country’s first WIT 120-equipped hospital in collaboration with Anhui Provincial People’s Hospital, where the voice assistant developed by the company can provide the patients with proper medical guidance.
Most importantly, the system is expected to provide AI-assisted remote medical diagnosis and treatment for 41 county hospitals after it is put into use, as it has learned nearly one million medical images and videos, 53 professional medical textbooks, two million medical records, and 400,000 medical documents and reports.

It takes approximately 10 seconds for a costumer to pay their bill using the facial recognition service, greatly increasing payment efficiency.
CNBC, Reuters, Yahoo News, and other Western media outlets praised China for taking the lead and putting the technology into commercial use.
Data shows that the market size of the facial recognition industry in China exceeded 1 billion RMB ($153.3 million) in 2016, and is estimated to reach 5.1 billion RMB by 2021.
However, many factors from the amount of light and to different angles influence the accuracy of the technology, so this mode of payment cannot be the only way for user authentication right now, said Liu Yunhuai, an expert at the third Research Institute of China’s Ministry of Public Security.
In addition, the future of the payment service still depends on safety assessments by supervision departments, and the aided validation process limits its convenience, so it is difficult to promote the application of the technology widely, Li Junhui, a researcher at the China Institute of Political Science and Law, noted.

BEIJING, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) -- China has made a series of achievements in science and technology over the past month as the country quickens its pace in becoming a leading science and tech power by the middle of the century.
China has been a leader in quantum technologies, which eliminate the possibility of wiretapping and secure communication. In early September, it was announced the Beijing-Shanghai quantum communication network has met requirements to open for service.
The 2,000-km network, the world's first, will be used for secure data transmission in the military, finance and government affairs fields.
The country has also completed a test of its high-throughput satellite Shijian-13, designating it as Zhongxing-16. With a transfer capacity of 20 Gbps, the satellite is capable of providing better Internet access on planes and high-speed trains, as well as in less-developed regions.
In a step toward launching a Mars probe around 2020, planners have mapped out a 400-million-yuan (61 million U.S. dollars) development plan to turn a red rock basin in Qaidam basin in northwest China's Qinghai Province into a Mars scientific research base and eco-tourism site.
The base is expected to consist of a ""Mars community"" and a ""Mars campsite."" The campsite will have a number of experimental module-like accommodations.
Underground research has also moved swiftly. Researchers recently acquired hot dry rock (HDR), with temperatures of 236 degrees Celsius, from 3,705 meters below Gonghe basin in Qinghai Province.
HDR is usually buried 3,000 to 10,000 meters under the earth's surface. It can be used to generate clean electricity via its high temperatures. The breakthrough means China is a step closer to easing environmental problems related to the greenhouse effect and acid rain.
China has made innovation the core of its 13th five-year plan (2016-2020), with the aim of becoming an ""innovation nation"" by 2020, an international leader in innovation by 2030, and a world powerhouse in scientific and technological innovation by 2050.
""We will accelerate R&D and commercialization of new materials, artificial intelligence, integrated circuits, bio-pharmacy, 5G mobile communications, and other technology to develop industrial clusters in these fields,"" said a government work report issued this year.
Such efforts will help the country improve convenience of transportation, raise living standards, resolve energy resource shortages, and boost economic development.
Developers said on Wednesday that track has been laid for China's longest high-speed railway at high latitudes, and the railway is scheduled to open in June 2018.
Running at 200 km per hour, the 343-km railway linking Harbin, capital of the northeast province of Heilongjiang, and Jiamusi in the same province, runs through four tunnels and over 120 bridges. It will cut travel time to 1.5 hours from 7 hours.
On the environmental front, an in-orbit test of China's first orbiting carbon observatory satellite was successfully completed in September. Scientists will convert magnetic signals received from the satellite into visible spectral signals, and then calculate the concentration of carbon dioxide.
While development of science and technology promises a better future, it also saves the lives of millions of people today.
According to a study published in late August, Chinese scientists have found a compound that helps a tumor-targeting virus kill liver cancer more effectively while sparing healthy cells, offering new hope for treating the world's second most common cancer killer.
A therapy that uses viruses to selectively kill cancer cells is rapidly progressing through clinical evaluation, but the therapeutic efficacy in humans has been less than expected from pre-clinical studies, according to the study published in the U.S. journal Science Translational Medicine.
China needs science and technology more than ever and the country's scientists should occupy the world's science and technology high ground, said Bai Chunli, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

China has compiled a new index to reflect the contribution of new growth drivers to the country's economic growth, said its statistical head on Thursday.
""After five years of exploration and application, China has established a statistical system that can reflect the development of the country's new growth drivers and industries,"" said Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics.
He made the announcement at the ninth meeting of the heads of national statistical offices of the BRICS countries in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province.
The New Growth Driver Index shows the role of economic vitality, digital economy, restructuring, knowledge capacity and innovation as new growth drivers.
Each of the five is again measured by way of a sub-index.
The new index has 2014 as its starting point. In 2015, it reached 129, up 29 percent year-on-year, said Ning.
The rise of the index in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, shows that China's new growth drivers are expanding at a fast pace.
China's economic vitality is growing, said a development report on China's new economic momentum, released for the first time by the NBS at the BRICS meeting.
The Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development, a think tank affiliated to the Ministry of Science and Technology, released a similar index in January to reflect the role new growth drivers, such as innovation and emerging industries, have played in expanding the Chinese economy.
That index had continued to grow in the 2012-15 period.
China has made strenuous efforts to restructure its economy, with focus on maximizing the potential of the economy through encouragement of innovation and support for the development of some key emerging areas such as new materials, artificial intelligence, internet and the digital economy.
NBS data show that from January to July, China's patent applications rose by 8 percent year-on-year to 1.83 million.
During that period, China's online retail sales increased by 33.7 percent, 6.2 percentage points higher than the same period of last year.
In the Global Innovation Index rankings compiled by the World Intellectual Property Organization, China stood at the 22nd place this year, up from 34 in 2012 and is the highest among mid-income economies.
The two-day statistical office head meeting of BRICS?Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa?opened in Hangzhou on Thursday, shortly after the three-day BRICS Summit ended in Xiamen in East China's Fujian province.

GUANGZHOU, Sept. 5 -- After a villager reported a foul odor in the air, environmental authorities of Dongguan City in south China's Guangdong Province dispatched a drone to Zhancui Village.
Equipped with several high-precision gas sensors, the drone is capable of detecting eight air pollutants, such as volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and PM2.5.
Hovering around 100 meters from the ground, the flying machine transmitted real-time monitoring data and geographic coordinates. Within 30 minutes, the drone produced a distribution map showing the levels of VOCs. Three red dots on the map indicated abnormal levels of the gas in the area.
Law enforcement officers then located the source of the pollution and punished three factories that had directly discharged waste gas into the air.
Known as the world's factory, Dongguan is a leading production base for garments and gadgets. One-fifth of the world's smartphones are produced there, as are one-fifth of the world's sweaters.
As of the first half of 2017, the total number of registered market entities in Dongguan had surpassed 900,000.
With so many factories crammed into a region around twice the size of Hong Kong, detecting pollution sources has long been a challenge for environmental inspectors.
Drones have offered a solution.
Dongguan started using drones to assist law enforcement in environmental protection in 2016.
At the very beginning, the city used common drones to take aerial photos to detect polluters. The photos were analyzed by environmental inspectors based on their own knowledge and experience.
""For example, the walls or work sheds of polluting factories showed signs of corrosion,"" said Chen Baihui, deputy director with the environment monitoring branch of the Dongguan Environmental Protection Bureau.
The pollution-detecting drone, co-developed by Shenzhen-based SciflyTech and Guangdong IntelFlight UAV Ltd., was introduced to the city early this year.
Jiang Shutong, the founder of SciflyTech, installed the ""nose"" and ""brain"" of the drones after he realized that drones, combined with artificial intelligence, may help China in environmental protection, which has been high on the country's agenda.
Attracted by a vibrant drone market, Jiang returned to China after graduating from the University of Auckland in New Zealand in 2016 and set up his own company in Shenzhen.
In addition to detecting eight types of pollutants, the drone can record information, including time, longitude and latitude, while collecting data to create an analysis report.
According to Chen, it was the third public tip-off in Zhancui Village. In the previous two reports, environmental inspectors failed to locate the exact pollution sources without the help of drones.
He estimated that one pollution-detecting drone can do the work of more than 60 environmental inspectors.
Take Zhancui Village's case for example. Traditional investigations require six law enforcement officers to work two days. ""And they may ultimately fail to locate the source of pollution,"" he said.
""Pollution-detecting drones are good at detecting waste gases in a certain region and can help the government fight pollution,"" said Li Qi, deputy general manager with IntelFlight.
Drones are also being used for creating news reports, delivering packages, and taking selfies.
Chinese online retailer JD.com started conducting trial deliveries using smaller drones in 2016. It plans to roll out a drone that can carry packages weighing as much as 200 kilograms for long-distance deliveries.
The overall market for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, is expected to reach 75 billion yuan (around 11 billion U.S. dollars) by 2025 in China, according to an iResearch report last year.
The report predicted that aerial photography by drone will generate 30 billion yuan alone. The revenue from drones in agriculture, forestry, power inspection and security is expected to be about 40 billion yuan.
The drone market is booming, but so is the counter-drone service industry, as critics worry that too many flying machines may infringe on privacy and threaten national security and public safety.
The pollution-detecting drone has been used in Zhejiang and Guizhou provinces, and it will be used overseas soon.
In October, Jiang will bring the drone to Silicon Valley for an international industrial drone exhibition, seeking cooperation with foreign partners.",'% artificial intelligence%'

The world’s No.1 weiqi (Go) player Ke Jie lost the contest against his artificial intelligence (AI) rival, AlphaGo, in the third and also final match of the summit on Saturday.
This match began at 10:30 BJT in Wuzhen, east China’s Zhejiang Province, with AlphaGo playing the black and Ke white.
Ke showed his brilliant weiqi skills as he said he will “fight till the end,” though he lost his previous two matches against AlphaGo on Tuesday and Thursday.
AlphaGo made the first “impolite” move as it did on Thursday – to put the black stone on the bottom-right corner of the weiqi board. It is a Chinese tradition that the first stone is usually placed around the top-right corner and this is what weiqi coaches always teach beginners.
“I think the black already wins,” said Nie Weiping, vice president of the Chinese Weiqi Association, and a Chinese weiqi legend, one hour after the match.
Just like Ke, Nie thinks AlphaGo is much stronger than any human player.
“I don’t think the match has any meaning because the huge capability gap between the two sides left no doubt who will win,” said Nie. “AlphaGo is a machine. The gap between human player and AlphaGo, for example, is like a race competition, in which we human players are like a bike or car, but AlphaGo is a plane, or even a spacecraft.”
Nie reckoned AlphaGo should be a coach for weiqi players as there is much to learn from the AI program's unusual moves in the three matches.
“I believe AlphaGo should be a coach for our professional weiqi players as a master to improve our weiqi capacity,” he said.
Although Ke fell behind fast in the beginning of the match, he fought hard to catch up with his AI opponent.
The margin became very small when the two players entered the endgame.
Ke and AlphaGo clashed hard on the last empty area on the board – the top edge.
The commentators tried very hard to guess what moves were to be made, but they were left surprised by the two sides.
During the endgame, AlphaGo chose to retreat in all places around the board, giving Ke some territory to keep the situation stable, as the machine was already confident about winning.
But Ke still chose to give up after struggling.
The match lasted over three and a half hours.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Huawei’s newest flagship phone, with artificial intelligence-powered features such as instant image recognition, will leave rivals Samsung and Apple playing a game of catch-up, a top executive said on Sunday.
Richard Wu, chief executive of Huawei’s consumer business, on Saturday revealed a powerful new mobile phone chip Huawei is betting on for its upcoming flagship Mate 10 and other high-end phones to deliver faster processing and lower power consumption.
Huawei will launch the Mate 10 and its sister phone, the Mate 10 Pro, in Munich on October 16, Wu confirmed. He declined to detail new features, but the phones are expected to boast large, 6-inch-plus full-screen displays, tech blogs predict.
Artificial intelligence (AI) built into its new chips can help make phones more personalized, or anticipate the actions and interests of their users, Wu said.
As examples, he said AI can enable real-time language translation, heed voice commands, or take advantage of augmented reality, which overlays text, sounds, graphics and video on real-world images phone users see in front of them.
Wu believes the new Kirin 970 chip’s speed and low power consumption can translate into features that will give its phones an edge over the Apple iPhone 8 series, set to be unveiled on September 12, and Samsung’s range of top-line phones announced this year. Huawei is the world’s No. 3 smartphone maker behind Samsung and Apple.
“Compared with Samsung and Apple, we have advantages,” Wu said in an interview during the annual IFA consumer electronics fair in Berlin. “Users are in for much faster (feature) performance, longer battery life and more compact design.”
The company asserts its newly announced Kirin 970 chip will preserve battery life on phones by up to 50 percent.
Huawei describes the new chip as the first Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for smartphones. It brings together classic computing, graphics, image and digital signal processing power that have typically required separate chips, taking up more space and slowing interaction between features within phones.
Most importantly, Huawei aims to use the Kirin chips to differentiate its phones from a vast sea of competitors, including Samsung, who overwhelming rely on rival Snapdragon chips from Qualcomm, the market leader in mobile chip design. Among major phone makers, only Apple and Huawei now rely on their own core processors.
The 970 is designed by Huawei’s HiSilicon chip design business and built using the most advanced 10 nanometer production lines of contract manufacturer TSMC.",'% artificial intelligence%'

(David Chen, vice president of Microsoft,in an interview with People's Daily Online. Zhang Hongyu/People's Daily Online)
“Microsoft is anxious to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative, and is seeking more opportunities in areas of Internet, big data, and artificial intelligence, both as a company in China and as a global company,” David Chen, vice president of Microsoft, told People’s Daily Online in an exclusive interview during the Media Cooperation Forum on Belt and Road on Sept. 19.
“The Belt and Road Initiative is a great initiative. I have seen support from many countries at the forum, as it helps the countries along the Silk Road to participate in the global economy. Its future is going to be very promising,” Chen noted.
In Chen’s opinion, China’s success in the past decades makes itself an example for other countries. “Over the past over 30 years, China has grown from a country facing many challenges to the second largest economy in the world. It has alleviated about 800 million people from poverty. It has many experiences that would be valuable to be shared with countries along the Belt and Road, so the forum also serves as a platform to share experiences, resources, and know-how with the rest of the world. I see many opportunities to work together in the initiative,” Chen explained.
China’s leapfrog development of new technologies in recent years, especially the development of e-commerce due to China’s market size and government support, have impressed Chen. He said Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent are now at the forefront of new technologies and have gone outside of China to participate in the global economy. They have a lot for other companies in the world to learn from.
According to Chen, Microsoft has been going through transformations for more than three years. The company is no longer a software licensing company, but is transforming into an important stakeholder for digital transformation, with a mission to empower every person and organization to achieve more by focusing in three areas: intelligent cloud, personal computing, and restructure for productivity. It hopes to be an enabler and partner of industries and companies in its journey of digital transformation. As China has over 700 million Internet users, with the majority of them being mobile ones, the opportunity is enormous for both new and traditional companies. Microsoft wants to be a partner with them.
Microsoft is already working with many companies in China and around the world that will find opportunities in the initiative. The company hopes to look for more concrete opportunities to work with the key stakeholders, so that its technologies can be used to facilitate the digital transformation of the companies, Chen pointed out.
On Sept. 21, Microsoft announced that Microsoft Azure IP Advantage will be available in China beginning Oct. 1, ensuring that customers in China can enjoy the same IP protection benefits as customers in the rest of the world. This move will help Chinese companies to manage intellectual property infringement risks when they taking advantage of opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative.
The 2017 Media Cooperation Forum on Belt and Road was held in Dunhuang, northwest China’s Gansu province.

Investors who inflate their income can be identified through new technologies, said Yang Jun, deputy chief risk officer of the Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd., at a conference on Sept. 20, Thepaper.cn reported.
A senior executive of the company said that they can help financial institutions identify eligible investors using five technologies: biological recognition, big data and risk management, block chain, artificial intelligence, and cloud technology, as they have obtained data on 880 million Chinese users so far.
The new technologies can help match product risks with investors’ risk tolerance, Yang noted.
Chief product officer of the company, Ou Haiying, explained that the company can judge the credit line of customers based on collected data ranging from their ages, income levels, genders, and telephone expenses.
He added that the company is currently focused on research into intelligent cognition. Since biological recognition technology like fingerprint identification and facial recognition is likely to be broken, the company will try to integrate voiceprint recognition with facial recognition and identity information.

One notable reason behind the progress was the diverse areas that Chinese entrepreneurship and scientific innovation are able to take place in. The scenario and technology have been the two gears that pushed history forward.
The US has been using technology to drive business situations, while China’s progress in technology has been pushed by new situations. For example, search technique led to the legend of Google, whereas in China, the e-commerce platform and payment system of Alibaba resulted in cloud computing, mobile payment, biometric identification, which turns out to be the synonyms of “China Wave”.
China’s progress is recognized by the world without doubt.
First of all, talent aggregation. A great amount of talents with skills in technology are coming back to China in recent years. In 2014, the number of Chinese students coming back from foreign countries surpassed students going abroad for education for the first time. In 2015, the number of students returning home is 77% of the total amount of students studying abroad. The percentage is only 23% 15 years ago.
Among the list of Innovators under age 35 by MIT Technology Review in 2017, six of them are Chinese. American author and public speaker John Naisbitt once said that more star entrepreneurs emerged in China, as it did in America during information revolution, and made the world aware of Chinese brands.
Second, progress in technology. The traffic of Chinese high-speed railway within five years outweighed France, that has 34 years’ history in operating railways. Its construction cost is only 1/3 to 1/2 of the cost of railway in German and France. China’s Tiangong will become the only operating space station in the foreseeable future.
China’s Sunway TaihuLight ranked top among 500 leading supercomputers worldwide. Its research and application in artificial intelligence has earned an authoritative place globally. As for financial technology, China’s mobile payment scale is 50 times as large as the amount of America.
Third, Chinese people’s convenient life amazes the whole world. Five years ago, we could hardly imagine our life would be like this:
It takes merely 5 hours to travel from Beijing to Shanghai, 1/4 of the travel time in the past; few people queue up any more. Everything can be done using a mobile phone; wallet is not necessary. In the era of facial recognition, you can simply “smile to pay” even without bringing a mobile phone.
Fourth, the power of China’s exports is worthy of noticing. Every wave is a revolution from technology to business models, and to lifestyles. Currently, China has become the learning object of many countries.
In India, QR codes are used in many restaurants, gas stations, bakery stalls, and teahouses. In Indonesia, people use mobile phones not only to arrange transportation services, but also to order food, package delivery, and dry cleaning services. Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Russia all intend to import China’s high-speed train technology. Traveling around the world on China’s high-speed rail is not a dream any more. We also see the Thai version of Headlines Today, the Malaysian version of Taobao, and the Singaporean version of Xian Yu, a second-hand online marketplace developed by China’s Alibaba Group. All of these mentioned above make Chinese tourists feel at home.
On a bigger scale, the mobile lifestyle of Chinese people is influencing the whole world. One can use Alipay to shop from Printemps in Paris, the UK’s Harrods, Finnair?Norwegian Cruise Line, City Sightseeing South Africa, or even within the Arctic Circle. “Hi, thank you, and Alipay” are the three things each foreigner has to learn. Bike-share services provided by Chinese companies are also available in more than 100 cities worldwide including Berlin and London.
The impact of “China Wave” is so huge that The Economists comments, “Western consumers are having their experience of the mobile internet shaped by a Chinese success story. Companies that want a glimpse of the future of mobile commerce should look not just to Silicon Valley but also to the other side of the Pacific.”",'% artificial intelligence%'

Luo Jun, CEO of the world's 3D printing Technology Industry Alliance, said during the third World 3D Printing Technology Conference & Expo.
Held in Chengdu, capital city in southwest China's Sichuan province, from June 4 to 5, the conference focuses on the 3rd generation of 3D printing. More than 1,200 delegates from over 10 countries and regions are taking part. Luo Jun predicts that the number of professional visitors will exceed 30,000.
""The Chinese government has just issued Made in China 2025"", said Luo. ""This is a document that looks forward to the future of China's manufacturing industry in 2025. The overall environment for 3D printing is improving fast, and prospects for the industry have never looked brighter.""
He pointed out that the global value of 3D printing reached 30 billion yuan last year, and China accounted for 10 percent of this total. In recent years China's government has placed 3D printing, together with robotics and artificial intelligence, at the forefront of technological development in the field of intelligent manufacturing. In the first half of this year, the government issued two important documents to promote the development of 3D printing industry.
At a news conference during the Expo, Bill O'Neill, Director of Cambridge Industrial Photonics Center, pointed out that 3D printing technology has been in existence for more than 30 years. But problems in adapting it to practical applications meant that for a long time it had remained an interesting phenomenon of limited commercial use.
Luo Jun confirmed the problem: ""Although 3D printing could be used on a wide range of products, it was not a commercially viable substitute for existing production methods as it was not suitable for mass production. We lacked a mature business model which could integrate 3D printing into industries like fashion, art, education, and training.""
Experts believe that the 3D printing must integrate with big data, cloud computing, networking, artificial intelligence, digital control technology and other advanced technologies. Ian Gibson, Professor of Machine Design at Deakin University in Australia, also pointed out that 3D printing has great potential in niche segments of major industries such as automobile production, aerospace, and biotechnology.
Following the Second World Conference & Expo of 3D printing in Qingdao in 2014 , the China Innovation Center of 3D Printing, the 3D Printing Research Institute, and several companies involved in online 3D printing set up in Qingdao's National High-tech Zone. They will be fully open in late June this year, providing a solid cluster as a base for the development of the 3D printing industry.

The traditional intelligence technology now can hardly meet the requirements of the vast amounts of complex information processing in the modern information society. With the development of brain cognition and neuroscience, academics realized that intelligence technology can draw inspiration from brain science and neuroscience in order to develop new theories and methods to improve the machine intelligence level.
According to Zheng Nanning, an academician at Chinese Academy of Engineering, brain-computing is one of the major challenges the scientific community faces in this century. It is a ""big issue"" that draws much concern from the computer science and artificial intelligence fields.
Tan Tieniu, an academician at Chinese Academy of Sciences, stressed that brain-like intelligence research has become a strategic behavior of the major developed countries. China should accelerate and promote its artificial intelligence development and seize the high ground for this new industrial revolution.

Event focusing on local high-tech industries
The 9th Central China Investment and Trade Expo opened on Monday, with delegations from various provinces hoping to strike deals that could boost economic development in the country's inland regions.
Running until Wednesday, the event, also known as Expo Central China 2015, is being held in Wuhan, capital of Central China's Hubei Province, and is designed to promote investment in six provinces - Hubei, North China's Shanxi, East China's Anhui and Jiangxi, and Central China's Henan and Hunan.
According to information posted on the Hubei provincial government website, some other cities and provinces in the ""Jing-Jin-Ji"" region - short for Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei - as well as those along the route of the ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative are also participating in the event.
The local governments of Northeast China's Jilin Province and Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region have also sent delegations to the expo.
""The event is a good opportunity for local authorities to present their advantages and seek suitable partners to push the transformation and upgrading of their local industries,"" Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times Monday.
More than 100 large-sized domestic companies and 192 delegations from overseas chambers of commerce, enterprises and associations are participating in the expo, including representatives of industries such as finance, logistics, tourism and e-commerce, according to information on the Hubei government website.
As the host province, Hubei on Monday launched a list of local projects, involving investment totaling 2.35 trillion yuan ($378.8 billion).
Bai noted that Hubei has advantages in high-tech and emerging industries thanks to a steady supply of graduates from local universities.
Ahead of the opening of the event, the Hubei government on Sunday signed a partnership deal with China Minsheng Investment Corp (CMIC) and signed a cooperation memorandum with the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association (TEEMA) to push forward the transformation and upgrading of local private enterprises, according to a statement posted on the Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission's website.
CMIC is expected to help develop Hubei's new-energy and optoelectronic industries, while TEEMA Chairman Guo Tai-chiang was quoted by the statement as saying that the association's member companies will strengthen ties with enterprises in Hubei.
The Hubei government also said in the statement that it intends to set up a partnership with e-commerce giant Alibaba Group to promote cross-border e-commerce and rural e-commerce in the province.
Other provinces are also trying to promote various businesses during the expo.
For instance, the delegation from Anhui is focusing on sectors like new-energy vehicles and artificial intelligence, while Shanxi is concentrating on solar-powered vehicles and drones, according to a report Sunday by cnhubei.com, the news portal of local newspaper the Hubei Daily.
""Finding their own distinct areas of strength is important, as it can help with collaborative development and avoid repeated construction in Central China,"" Xu Hongcai, director of the Department of Information under the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, told the Global Times Monday.
In addition, provinces should take advantage of the ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative and the Yangtze River economic belt strategy to make themselves more appealing to investors, said Xu.
The Central China Investment and Trade Expo has been held every year - apart from 2014 - since 2006, as part of the central government's efforts to boost development in Central China.
A ""Rise of Central China"" strategy was put forward by the central government in 2004, aiming to realize more balanced development and enable central regions to catch up with eastern coastal areas.
In March 2015, the State Council, China's cabinet, unveiled a plan to develop city clusters along the Yangtze River, mainly consisting of cities in Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, in order to create a new economic growth engine.
The country also started creating an economic belt along the Yangtze River in 2014.
The government's continued emphasis on developing Central China has already made the region an attractive place for investors in China and from abroad.
Since 2006, the expo has attracted more than $130 billion in overseas investment in total, according to a report by the Hubei Daily in early May.
A total of 292 projects are expected to be signed during this year's event, amounting to 394.4 billion yuan, of which 293.7 billion yuan is set to come from foreign investors, the Hubei Daily reported on Monday.
Apart from potential policy support, the greater abundance of low-cost labor in Central China compared to eastern areas is also something that appeals to investors, said Bai.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Last year, the US released its robot development plan and roadmap, which focuses on developing new generation robots that can work closely with human beings. South Korea also issued its second five year plan on developing intelligent robots. Robots have become an important growth point of the new industrial revolution, and will exert significant influence over the global manufacturing industry.
According to information released by the Ministry of Science and Technology, after nearly 30 years work, China's robot research and development chain, extending from basic research for applications to industrialized production, is now in place. The industrial robot and service robot industry is taking shape.
Moreover, China's research and development of robots serving in special environments has made great progress. China has successfully developed its Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) capable of exploring the ocean down to 6,000 meters, a long-voyage underwater robot, an underwater vehicle designed for maximum dive depth of 7000 meters (Jiaolong), and the Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV). These achievements have laid a solid foundation for the research into and large-scale application of robots. China's self-developed operating maintenance robots for multiple types of nuclear reactors have been brought into service. Several types of robots designed for disaster relief, public security and other fields have entered the pilot stage.
China's robot industry offers huge prospects for growth. In recent years, the number of newly installed industrial robots has increased by 30 percent annually. According to statistics released by China Robot Industry Alliance, 37,000 industrial robots were sold in China in 2013, ranking the Chinese market first in the world. Assuming that China has a total of 100 million industrial workers, by 2020, China is expected to have installed 1.3 million robots to meet the average level of 150 robots per 10,000 workers; and by 2030, China is expected to have installed 2.5 million robots to meet the developed level of 250 robots per 10,000 workers.
Cai Hegao, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, said: ""We can't give up China's robot market to foreign suppliers. We need to develop our own technologies and occupy the market with self-developed robots.""

For decades, people have been predicting how the rise of advanced computing and robotic technologies will affect our lives. On one side, there are warnings that robots will displace humans in the economy, destroying livelihoods, especially for low-skill workers. Others look forward to the vast economic opportunities that robots will present, claiming, for example, that they will improve productivity or take on undesirable jobs. The venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who recently joined the debate, falls into the latter camp, asserting that robots will save us from a future of high prices and low wages.
Figuring out which side is right requires, first and foremost, an understanding of the six ways that humans have historically created value: through our legs, our fingers, our mouths, our brains, our smiles and our minds. Our legs and other large muscles move things to where we need them to be, so our fingers can rearrange them into useful patterns. Our brains regulate routine activities, keeping the leg- and finger-work on track. Our mouths - indeed, our words, whether spoken or written - enable us to inform and entertain one another. Our smiles help us to connect with others, ensuring that we pull roughly in the same direction. Finally, our minds - our curiosity and creativity - identify and resolve important and interesting challenges.
Thiel, for his part, refutes the argument - often made by robot doomsayers - that the impact of artificial intelligence and advanced robotics on the labor force will mirror globalization's impact on advanced-country workers. Globalization hurt lower-skill workers in places like the US, as it enabled people from faraway countries to compete for the leg-and-finger positions in the global division of labor. Given that these new competitors demanded lower wages, they were the obvious choice for many companies.
According to Thiel, the key difference between this phenomenon and the rise of robots lies in consumption. Developing-country workers took advantage of the bargaining power that globalization afforded them to gain resources for their own consumption. Computers and robots, by contrast, do not consume anything except electricity, even as they complete leg, finger, and even brain activities faster and more efficiently than humans would.
Here, Thiel offers an example from his experience as CEO of PayPal. Instead of having humans scrutinize every item in every batch of 1,000,000 transactions for indications of fraud, PayPal's computers can approve the obviously legitimate transactions, and pass on the 1,000 or so that could be fraudulent for thoughtful consideration by a human. One worker and a computer system can thus do what PayPal would have had to hire 1,000 workers to do a generation ago. Given that the computer system does not need things like food, that thousand-fold increase in productivity will redound entirely to the benefit of the middle class.
Put another way, globalization lowered the wages of low-skill advanced-country workers because others would perform their jobs more cheaply, and then consume the value that they had created. Computers mean that higher-skill workers - and the lower-skill workers who remain to oversee the large robotic factories and warehouses - can spend their time on more valuable activities, assisted by computers that demand little.
Thiel's argument may be correct. But it is far from airtight.
In fact, Thiel seems to be running into the old diamonds-and-water paradox - water is essential, but costs nothing, whereas diamonds are virtually useless, but extremely expensive - albeit in a sophisticated and subtle way. The paradox exists because, in a market economy, the value of water is set not by the total usefulness of water (infinite) or by the average usefulness of water (very large), but by the marginal value of the last drop of water consumed (very low).
Similarly, the wages and salaries of low- and high-skill workers in the robot-computer economy of the future will not be determined by the (very high) productivity of the one lower-skill worker ensuring that all of the robots are in their places or the one high-skill worker reprogramming the software. Instead, compensation will reflect what workers outside the highly productive computer-robot economy are creating and earning.
The newly industrialized city of Manchester had the highest level of labor productivity the world had ever seen. But the factory workers' wages were set not by their extraordinary productivity, but by what they would earn if they returned to the potato fields of pre-famine Ireland.
So the question is not whether robots and computers will make human labor in the goods, high-tech services, and information-producing sectors infinitely more productive. They will. What really matters is whether the jobs outside of the robot-computer economy - jobs involving people's mouths, smiles, and minds - remain valuable and in high demand.
From 1850 to 1970 or so, rapid technological progress first triggered wage increases in line with productivity gains. Then came the protracted process of income-distribution equalization, as machines, installed to substitute for human legs, and fingers created more jobs in machine-minding, which used human brains and mouths, than it destroyed in sectors requiring routine muscle power or dexterity work. And rising real incomes increased leisure time, thereby boosting demand for smiles and the products of minds.
Will the same occur when machines take over routine brainwork? Maybe. But it is far from being a safe bet on which to rest an entire argument, as Thiel has.

The autonomous flying robotic waiters, known as Infinium-Serve, will be first launched at an outlet of Timbre Group. Local broadcaster Channel NewsAsia said it is believed to be the world's first commercial attempt.
Infinium Robotics and Timbre Group signed a memorandum of understanding in October. Both companies are seeking productivity- related government grants to help offset deployment costs.
Infinium Robotics Chief Executive Officer Woon Junyang said the project is estimated to cost a ""low seven-figure sum"" for the five outlets, subject to final negotiations and certain variables.
The company has showcased a prototype of Infinium-Serve to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the inaugural launch of the National Productivity Month in early October.
Woon said he is confident that such robotic solutions will help alleviate the labor crunch in Singapore. It would help take away mundane tasks of serving food and drinks, and allow human waiters to focus on higher-value tasks such as getting feedback from customers, he said.

Wearable body sensors are becoming the latest ""must-have"" technology. Now scientists from the Tsinghua University in China report they are using silk to develop a more sensitive and flexible device that could monitor a slew of body functions in real time.
Body sensors, which are usually made with semiconductors, have shown great potential for monitoring human health. But they have limitations. For instance, strain sensors, which measure changes in force, cannot be highly sensitive and highly stretchable at the same time.

Silk, a natural fiber that is stronger than steel and more flexible than nylon, could overcome these problems, according to a new report by Science Daily.
""Silk is the ideal material for fabricating sensors that are worn on the body,"" said Ph D Yingying Zhang, who led the research.
At the same time, the material is also lightweight and bio-compatible.
""One possibility is to be used as an integrated wireless system that would allow doctors to more easily monitor patients remotely so that they can respond to their medical needs more rapidly than ever before,"" Zhang said.
However, this material doesn't conduct electricity very well. To address this challenge, researchers tried two methods to boost the conductivity of silk so that it could be successfully be used in body-sensing devices.
Silk sensors could speed development of new infrastructure, aerospace and consumer materials /Phys.org Photo
In one method, researchers treated silk in an inert gas environment with temperatures ranging from 1,112 degrees to 5,432 degrees Fahrenheit. Consequently, the silk became infused with N-doped carbon with some graphitized particles, which is electrically conductive. Based on this theory, researchers have developed different sensor product, including strain sensors, pressure sensors and a dual-mode sensor, all of which are capable of measuring temperature and pressure at the same time.
In the other method, the team fed either carbon nanotubes or graphene to silkworms. Some of these nanoparticles were naturally added into the silk produced by the worms. Though this method has not produced electrically conductive fibers so far, researchers are still experimenting with it. It could be used to build more practical robots that need to be more sensitive to touch and temperature and can even differentiate between people's voices, researchers said.",'% robot%'

Beijing declared its strategic vision of building a global innovation center for the robot industry by 2025 at the ongoing 2017 World Robot Conference (WRC).
The WRC, a feast for both tech geeks and general visitors, kicked off on Aug. 23 in Beijing.
China is transiting from a major market of robot applications to an innovation base for the industry.
Sales volume of industrial robots in China has seen an average annual growth of 35% in recent years. A total of 72,000 industrial robots have been produced by the country in 2016, accounting for a quarter of the world's total.
In addition, China is now leading the world in terms of voice and image recognition technologies, and has made major breakthroughs in the development of key components, such as controllers, servomotors, and precise reducers.
As the hotbed of China's cutting-edge information technologies, Beijing has its advantages in the development of the robot industry. In 2016, the city's revenue of software and information service industries totaled 728.76 billion yuan. Meanwhile, Beijing is also home to more than 240 AI enterprises, with 7,841 patents.
Beijing will take two steps to achieve its strategic vision. By 2020, the capital will have established 10 leading industry enterprises, 10 research and innovation centers, and 10 major industrial robot projects, raising revenue by 12 to 15 billion yuan.
For the second step, the city plans to forge a world-leading system of robotic technology synergy innovation, and complete the construction of the innovation center before 2025.",'% robot%'

China's internet has seen rapid developments in online purchases and public services over the past two years and will continue to benefit from the two areas, a national internet authority said on Friday.
A report released by the China Internet Network Information Center said China had 751 million netizens by the end of June — 19.92 million more than the number in December.
Of the netizens, 514 million used online platforms for purchases, a 10.2 percent increase compared with the figure at the end of last year, the report said.
""Netizens can not only buy food and clothes online, but also intelligent products, such as sweeping robots and dishwashing machines,"" said Zhang Xiao, deputy director of the center, which issues the report every six months.
""Our choices while shopping online have been more diversified,"" she said, adding that the way of purchasing online has also extended from big cities to rural areas, stimulating e-commercial development in villages.
As online purchases increase, the number of netizens using the internet to serve their daily lives, such as those ordering takeout food or paying water fees online, has been booming, the report said.
By the end of June, for example, 295 million netizens had ordered takeout meals online, which was 86.78 million more than in December, it said, adding that 274 million of those had ordered food via mobile phones.
""About seven years ago, online games were main forces to push internet development. But now, the impetus has become public services,"" said Liu Xin, deputy director of the center's internet research department.
""The internet is not only a stage to search news and information, it has also been a major platform to improve our consumption as well as an effective way to serve our daily lives,"" he said. ""The change has been significant over the past two years.""
He added that online purchasing and public services will continue contributing to cyberspace growth. He estimated that online entertainment, including livestreaming, will bring new economic growth to the internet.
Kong Yiying, 29, a resident of Guangzhou, Guangdong province, said she spends more than six hours daily online for purchases, and the monthly expense is about 5,000 yuan ($745).
""I can buy what I want online, and it's very fast and convenient. I purchase baby diapers in the morning, and my son can wear them in the afternoon,"" she said.
""I prefer online shopping because I'm not familiar with Guangzhou. I just came to the city two years ago when I got married,"" she said, adding that young people have not been the main driving force of online purchases.

After DPRK’s recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, U.S. President Donald Trump took to social media to complain that China is doing nothing to help although China can “easily solve this problem.” Trump believes the “greatest immediate threat” to the U.S. is North Korea and that China can “easily solve this problem,” but the real question might be why North Korea feels the need to arm itself to the teeth.
In a commentary by the state-run North Korean government newspaper Minju Choson, North Korea accused the U.S. of developing an “insect-size micro robot weapon” to be used for a “beheading operation” against the regime. Although the newspaper’s claim cannot be independently verified, it is no secret at least some in the U.S. government desire to destroy the country, as U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham reminded the world on NBC News. “There is a military option to destroy North Korea’s program and North Korea itself.”
North Korea’s recent claim is, of course, one of many, but the overarching theme remains the same: In the eyes of North Korea, at least according to its media, the U.S. is determined to pursue military action against the country. It should be no surprise then that North Korea feels insecure, and this has led to a vicious cycle.
The case can be made that North Korean nuclear weapons are the only reliable deterrent to American aggression. In North Korea, they have an interesting children’s story about a peaceful community that feels threatened by a ruthless tiger. The story ends on a happy note, at least for North Korea, with the tiger running off with its tail between its legs after a brave porcupine steps up to accept the challenge. The underlying meaning is simple: The ultimate thing keeping the U.S. from ripping the country to pieces is its nuclear deterrent.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. does not seek regime change in North Korea and would like to sit down and have dialogue about the future. But obviously, such statements are not credible to North Korea and do nothing to end the vicious cycle.
The solution to the dilemma is to not aggravate the explosive situation. Venting frustration over the failure of U.S. foreign policy; threatening economic coercion against China; and threatening the security of North Korea are only adding fuel to the fire. If the U.S. sincerely hopes China will help the U.S. solve its conflict with North Korea, then it should take seriously China’s “dual-track” approach and “suspension-for-suspension” proposal, which calls on North Korea to suspend its missile and nuclear activities in exchange for a less aggressive U.S. military posture, to help break out of the security dilemma and launch meaningful talks.
While China certainly has an important role to play in helping the two sides avoid a head-on collision, it is ridiculous to assume China has control over North Korea or is responsible for solving America’s security problem. Saying China can easily solve the problem is like saying peace in the Middle East is “not as difficult as people have thought”; and the so-called “China responsibility theory” is based on a poor understanding of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, as well as baseless efforts to shift responsibility for the complicated problem onto China and others.
If the U.S. aim is to promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, then the region would be best served through collective efforts to create a situation in which the best formula for survival is not nuclear or other forms of hard power. But one thing is for certain: China is not to blame for North Korea’s missile and nuclear ambitions. As China has repeated over and over again, it is the U.S. and North Korea that hold the key to peace.",'% robot%'

CANBERRA, Sept. 26 -- Australian scientists developed a prototype autonomous vehicle, ""Outback Rover,"" to help scientists to improve the accuracy of Earth observation satellites that provide valuable data to Australia's mining and agricultural industries, according to a latest research statement from CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, on Thursday.
Just as the Mars Rover Curiosity is gathering information about our neighboring planet, CSIRO's affectionately nicknamed 'Outback Rover' is helping to calibrate satellites that provide clues to Earth's soil condition, mineralogy and vegetation.
According to the statement, accompanied by researchers from Japan, China, Israel and France, CSIRO scientists recently took the rover prototype on a mission to Lake Lefroy -- a huge salt lake in remote Western Australia -- to see if they can automate the satellite calibration process.
This is where information gathered by satellites is matched against measurements taken on-ground and compared for accuracy, said Professor Arnold Dekker, Director of Earth Observation and Informatics at CSIRO.
""Satellite data is used for resource exploration, environmental monitoring and agricultural management such as soil mapping. So it must be regularly cross-checked to ensure that observations are accurate,"" Dekker explained.
""This process is called vicarious calibration and is undertaken by ground crews who walk in grids or transects, taking measurements with hand-held devices known as spectrometers, as satellites travel overhead,"" Dekker added.
CSIRO's science leader for robotics Dr. Alberto Elfes said this could be about to change. He hopes the rover will be able to collect calibration data autonomously and send it wirelessly back to researchers.
""The ultimate goal is to have the rover operate alone, with scientists from over the world able to retrieve data from it or control it remotely in real-time,"" Dr. Elfes said. ""For example, scientists could tell the robot to turn left or right, follow a sensor signature that is interesting or do a more detailed analysis in a particular area.""
""Once we know we have acquired accurate data from satellites, it can be used for a range of applications. It can show us where to explore for mineral deposits and even allow us to monitor soils, which can provide great benefit to our farmers,"" Dr. Elfes said.
In addition, as well as ensuring the accuracy of the current suite of space traveling cameras and sensors, the information collected by the rover could also be used for the next-generation of satellites that will use high-resolution 'hyperspectral' images.
Owing to its sheer size, Australia is one of the world's biggest consumers of Earth observation data however it doesn't own any remote sensing satellites.
""This is why international collaborations like this are vitally important, and have led to major achievements such as our world- first continental scale mineral maps, derived from the Japanese ASTER sensor on board the NASA TERRA satellite,"" Professor Dekker said.

“Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour” by Cirque du Soleil combines the music and vision of Michael Jackson as well as acrobatic performance.(Shanghai Daily)
A Michael Jackson dance competition Sunday draws fans from around China to watch MJ imitators strut their best moonwalks, robots, toe stands, anti-gravity leans and Egyptian flares. Zhang Qian talks to dance fans.
Michael Jackson fans will imitate his legendary moves — moonwalk to the robot — in a dance competition on Sunday, to commemorate the King of Pop who died four years ago.
The event also marks the anniversary this month of Jackson’s birth, August 29, 1958.
Around 20 fans, ranging in age from 11 to 36, have registered for the competition at Windows Too of Jiuguang Department Store on Nanjing Road W., starting at noon.
French choreographer Michael Sumana and overseas MJ imitators will perform as guest dancers.
The Chinese winner will receive a certificate and VIP tickets for Sunday night’s “Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour” presented by the Cirque du Soleil at Shanghai Mercedes-Benz Arena.
Jackson, who was preparing for a comeback, died of an overdose on June 25, 2009, at the age of 51.
Fans around the world keep his music alive, including those in China, and many from around China are expected to watch the competition Sunday and share their memories of MJ. Expats also come for the show.
The contest Sunday is the third MJ dance competition organized by MJJCLUB since 2011.
The participants present their best MJ imitations, judged by professional choreographers and previous MJ dance competition winners. Favorite pieces are “Billie Jean,” “Dangerous” and “Smooth Criminal.”
Fans can expect to see the super moonwalk, the anti-gravity lean, toe stand, Egyptian flare, the robot and other moves. Probably not the famous crotch grab.
The annual competition arose from the fan club’s aim to commemorate the King of Pop and the number of contestants keeps rising, according to Michael Chan, the organizer of the competition.

The joint venture platform, Maker2, or Maker Squared, will integrate service resources of Beijing Makerspace (BM) from the capital and Shanghai's WeWork-like co-working space People Squared (P2), and expand services to another five large cities. It will offer shared working space with a total area of 150,000 square meters nationwide.
BM, one of China's biggest laboratories for makers, houses about 300 innovators in the capital, while P2 offers Chinese makers the biggest shared working space in the country. The total amount of financing of the projects served by the two reach 4 billion yuan (614 million U.S. dollars).
Chuangke, or makers, are hands-on technology enthusiasts who use 3D printers, robotics, and other advanced tools to turn creative ideas into pervasive products.
As the Chinese government promotes mass entrepreneurship and innovation to refuel the economic engine, Chuangke have been marked out as more than a creator, inventor or innovator, as the word has an entrepreneurial slant to it.
Currently there are 40,000 to 50,000 makers in China, according to Wang Shenglin, CEO of BM. Co-working has become a popular style of work for the rapidly growing start-up community as it is more economical and some places like P2 also offers incubation and funding services.

According to the latest edition of MIT Technology Review, a start-up company named Brain of Things is building three ""robot homes"" in the state of California. These homes will contain sensors and other automated systems that learn residents' habits and facilitate their lives.
Some technicians predict that robots will become an important part of human families one day, and houses, too, may become automated. Houses will know what people are doing, explained Ashutosh Saxena, founder of Brain of Things. If people walk around the house, the house can also track their actions.
Among other things, the house can turn on the lights when you want a drink of water in the middle of the night. It can automatically open the curtains at the time you typically wake up, and close the curtains at night; it even knows to open the curtains later after you stay out late on weekends.
There are about 20 motion sensors in the ""robot homes,"" including sensors for lights, electric appliances, entertainment systems, heating systems, air conditioning and water heating systems. Residents can use manual switches or mobile applications to operate the functions of each house.

China’s supply-side structural reform has scored positive results, Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) told reporters on Monday, citing optimized industrial, investment and consumption structures.
A new economy led by information technology and high-tech industry is just around the corner, said Ning, referencing the thrilling match between South Korean Go master Lee Se-dol and the artificial intelligence AlphaGo as he said that Chinese robot output has already increased by 17 percent in the first two months of this year.
He noted that the output of new energy vehicles also doubled in that same period. At the same time, the production of crude steel dropped by 5.7 percent and output of nonferrous metal also declined by 4.3 percent.
Ning, also a deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, pointed out that the data indicated that China’s economy underwent stable growth in January and February, citing the stable fundamentals in employment, domestic demands and commodity prices.
In the first two months of the year, the registered unemployment rate in 31 major cities stood at about 5.1 percent, lower than that of the same period in last year, said Ning. Fixed-asset investment was up 10.2 percent from a year earlier.
Retail sales, used as a measure of domestic consumption, maintained steady growth of 10.2 percent in the same period, implying that China’s economy now relies more on domestic demands.
The country’s industrial, investment and consumption structures have been optimized, according to the NBS head.
He said that the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, increased by 1.8 percent year-on-year in January and by 2.3 percent in the following month, which still falls short of the goal to ""keep the increase in CPI at around 3 percent"" set in this year’s government work report. Commodity prices demonstrated a stable rise without large fluctuations.
Though industrial growth slowed, growth in the service industry was rapid. It accounted for more than 50 percent of total GDP, further optimizing the economic structure, Ning said.
Hailing a better investment structure, Ning said that China has invested more in the high-tech and infrastructural sectors but less in energy-intensive industries.
Income from tourism saw double-digit growth during the Spring Festival holidays, witnessing a drop in banquet and tourism at the public’s expense but an increase in mass catering and tourism, Ning said, adding that in the first two months, income from the catering sector also soared 11.3 percent from a year earlier.",'% robot%'

There are still accidents caused by unmanned technology, however. A self-driving car developed by Google crashed into a bus last month during a test drive. When will people actually begin to benefit from unmanned technology?
Accident caused by Google self-driving car
One of Google's self-driving cars crashed into a bus in California on Feb. 14. There were no injuries.
The crash happened when the robotic SUV had to move into the center lane to make a right turn around some sandbags. The accident occurred because both the vehicle and its test driver incorrectly assumed that a bus approaching from behind would slow or stop to let the car through.
It may be the first instance of a Google self-driving car being at fault for an accident. Google said that in the past six years, its cars have been involved in 17 minor accidents over the course of more than two million miles of autonomous and manual driving.
That its software made a decision that led to a crash might be bad news for Google, as the company is devoted to improving its self-driving technology. People also have doubts about self-driving driving technology. Who is to be blamed for this accident? The computer? The company? Or the constantly changing road conditions?
Insurance companies are also reluctant to compensate for accidents caused by small-size drones.
Unmanned technology has been used more than anything with drones so far. The development of drones is more comprehensive than that of self-driving car technology. Drones are widely used in military and civilian industries. Small-size multirotors and reconnaissance UAVs in the U.S. military all belong to drones.
However, risks exist when it comes to small-size drones. Last Christmas, the sales volume of drones saw a rapid increase in the U.K. Nevertheless, insurance companies announced an exception clause, saying they would not compensate for damage caused by drones.
More seriously, drones have been involved in incidents where they nearly collided with passenger aircraft in the U.S., Japan and China.
Police have come up with methods to cope with these risks. Police in the Netherlands train eagles to capture illegal drones in the sky. Japan uses UAVs to deal with illegal drones.
Will people get enjoy unmanned delivery sooner or later?
With the development of unmanned technology, e-commerce has begun exploring unmanned delivery.
Amazon.com was the first to try unmanned delivery. The company has developed a drone, Amazon Prime Air, for delivery. Amazon Prime Air uses multirotor Miniature Unmanned Air Vehicle technology to autonomously fly packages to customers’ doorsteps within 30 minutes of ordering. The drone can also return autonomously.
However, unmanned delivery is restricted by government regulations. Furthermore, drones used for delivery face limitations when it comes to payloads, endurance and weather conditions.
London is currently testing a self-driving truck, but a driver will sit in front of the steering wheel for the sake of safety.
For the time being, delivery of goods bought online still relies on couriers.
Can people become snipers without being trained?
A new rifle, called TrackingPoint rifle, developed by a start-up company in Texas, went on sale in the U.S. in 2013. Its unique feature is that it uses lasers and computers to make shooters exceptionally accurate.
Experts said that the new gun, which aims automatically, cannot shoot with great accuracy in actual combat, and is not a substitute for a human shooter, as 32 different elements can affect accuracy of shooting, including air pressure, temperature and altitude. The automated system cannot cope with multiple elements at one time.",'% robot%'

In the latest report issued by Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday, the internationally famous credit rating agency downgraded its outlook on China’s credit rating from “stable” to “negative,” while affirming the still-respectable Aa3 grade on its sovereign debt.
But the credibility of Moody’s encountered a challenge in the Chinese market since its bearish prediction was not echoed by other voices in the financial market. Neither the currency exchange nor the Asia-Pacific share market seconded the negative outlook.
Generally speaking, operation and supervision of the financial market has shown increased reliance on credit rating tools in recent years. As industry giants, companies such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's now have a major influence.
The downgrading of a sovereign credit rating or outlook from a major player like that often leads to financial panic for implicated country. Even worse, if those involved are major powers, the panic can spill to other countries in the region or other countries encountering similar economic woes.
However, the forecast made by Moody's about China was not followed this time by a market panic. On the contrary, the RMB currency rate remained stable and the Asia-Pacific stock market kept rising following the downgrade.
A weakening of Moody’s authority may result from this prediction, which can be attributed to a poor understanding of the Chinese economy.
First of all, Moody’s misjudged what rising government debt means for China.
When downgrading China’s outlook, some of the reasons Moody's cited were uncertainty over authorities' capacity to implement economic reforms, rising government debt and falling reserves. However, one thing that was not taken into consideration was the differences between the debts of China, the U.S., Europe, Japan and other emerging markets.
Since investment is a big piece of China’s government expenditure, most debts have corresponding assets. This means that the same debt ratio would bring far less burden to China than to other debtors.
What’s more, the reason the Chinese government shouldered more liabilities is that it can partially prevent deflation caused by capital flight.
The moderate expansion of China’s deficit and debt within its settlement ability is not only good for short-sellers, but also healthy for the overall economy because it indicates that China’s currency supply is able to meet the demand brought by economic growth.
It also implies that currency creation relies less on foreign countries, and China’s financial system can be more independent as a result.
Similar to the rising government debt, China’s failing foreign currency reserve is not necessarily a bad thing for its economy.
The recent decrease in the reserve is mostly attributed to currency conversions of enterprises, financial agencies and residents.
Also, since the beginning of the new century, China’s policymakers have been distracted by rising foreign reserves as China has paid an enormous amount of seigniorage, or profit from issuing a currency, to western countries.
Therefore, in the past decade, the Chinese government has been encouraging the stockpiling of foreign exchange reserve in State coffers so as to diversify external assets and improve structure.
Even today, when the reserve has been cut down significantly, China still holds more foreign currency than any other country, which is more than enough to meet its foreign settlement demand.
At the same time, constant trade surplus and the influx of direct foreign investment bring the country more reserves.
When China’s ability to meet foreign settlement demand is not at risk, shortening the foreign exchange reserve means optimizing its structure of foreign assets.
In the long run, this will benefit the economy rather than undermining it.
For international rating giants like Moody’s, who misinterpret China’s national conditions and economy, it is essential to step up their game if they intend to maintain their dominance in the market.

Restaurant with robot waitresses closed. (Photo/Guangzhou Daily)
Robot waitresses at restaurants used to be a somewhat common gimmick in Guangzhou. Many customers came to the restaurants more for the experience of being served by a robot than for the food. But now, of the six restaurants in Guangzhou using robot waitresses, three are experiencing issues with their robot employees.
The very first restaurant in Guangzhou that used a robot waitress has now closed. A hot pot restaurant that once spent 140,000 yuan on two robot waitresses has also closed, while another restaurant actually fired its robot waitress.
Instead of spreading throughout Guangzhou, how and why have robot waitresses become an obstacle for restaurants?
Industry experts explain that although robot waitresses present an excellent marketing opportunity, robots can only replace low-level labor. Compared with human beings, robot waitresses are overly simplistic — not yet able to serve customers satisfactorily since all they can do is follow simple instructions without feelings.
Moreover, using a robot waitress costs much more than employing a human waitress. For example, each robot waitress costs 65,000 yuan with an additional 1,000 yuan maintenance fee and a 1,080 yuan electricity fee. Those numbers far exceed the average salary of a human waitress — only 46,800 yuan a year. It takes at least five years for most restaurants to cover the cost of a robot waitress.",'% robot%'

The human race has long dreamed of living on the moon.
That dream, thanks to international collaboration and the latest scientific breakthroughs, is now a step closer.
Some scientists are imagining a futuristic lunar ""village"" on the Moon's surface, created using smart 3D-printing rovers, to create structures from the Moon's own natural sources.
Johann-Dietrich Woerner, who became the director general of the European Space Agency last July, believes that human beings will eventually live and work on the Moon.
His vision of a lunar settlement includes various space-faring nations, all living and working together.
""The Moon village, we would like to combine the capabilities of different space-faring nations, be it robotic or be it human, to look also for different activities, be it pure science, be it also business, even tourism, or mining or whatever, to put them together on the same place, and this is the idea of the Moon village.""
Woerner sees a permanent lunar base as the next logical step, particularly following successful collaboration between space enabled countries on the International Space Station.
""The idea is that the different actors, the different players worldwide, they look in their special capabilities, and their special interests, and they bring just their small part into the idea. That means we can start with a small landing mission, which many countries are already planning, up to a huge investment for instance for some telescope, radio telescope, on the far side of the Moon. So it's multiple uses by multiple users, but a single place.""
But how could you build such structures so far away from Earth?
One idea is to use the Moon's own natural resources to build and sustain a lunar base.
Roaming rovers could gather ice, metals and minerals to 3D print a structure or building.
A rover would land on the surface, inflate a dome, and then begin constructing a building to protect it and the astronauts inside.
Woerner hopes establishing a lunar base will allow experts to set up a radio telescope on the far side of the moon, shielded from radio pollution from Earth.
Astronauts could also be sent to the Moon's pole regions, where unmanned missions have previously found water ice.
He says as more nations make plans to return to the Moon, the need for a permanent base will grow.
""The first step is already done. The first step is that we are discussing it and there are several member states of ESA, but also outside ESA, which are interested in doing some missions to Moon. So we have also from ESA we have a cooperation together with the Russians for some Moon landing ideas. So, all of these now have to be in a further discussion process, come together. So it's started already. ""
China has long advocated collaboration in space research, and a mission to the moon to collect samples is scheduled for later this year.
China is also well on the way to launching a manned space station into low Earth orbit in the coming years.",'% robot%'

IFA 2016 contained a number of popular Asian brands, such as TCl and LeTV, in addition to products from the U.S. and Germany. The drone industry proved its ongoing popularity at the event, as well-known companies like DJI and ZEROTECH brought their products to IFA’s international stage.
China becomes a drone industry leader
Thanks to China’s upgrade of its domestic manufacturing and information technology industries, DJI was able to take another big step into the American and European markets, after launching its Phantom series in 2012. At the same time, more and more Chinese drone companies are growing quickly and launching “must-have” products. DJI and ZEROTECH are both industry leaders in flight control, camera stabilizers, image transmission and more. In fact, several Chinese drone companies have climbed to the same level as U.S. drone company 3DR and French drone company Parrot.
Chinese companies take the lead in small consumer drones
2016 has been a good year for drone companies, and ZEROTECH attracted a lot of attention with its very first Pocket Drone, DOBBY. Drone lovers from all over the world became fans of this mini consumer drone. Other companies like Yuneec and Zero Zero Robotics also followed the trend, launching their own small consumer drones.
ZEROTECH’s DOBBY was the first pocket drone with a built-in Qualcomm Snapdragon chip. Weighing in at only 199 grams, DOBBY can be controlled via a smart phone and offers a number of intelligent features such as target tracking and 10-second auto track short videos. DOBBY will be available in North America and Europe in late September. According to FAA regulations, drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds (around 250 grams) need to be registered before flight. However, the lightweight DOBBY is exempt from this requirement.
The future of the drone industry is bright, and China is likely to remain an industry leader due to the country’s advanced AI and unmanned control technology. Companies like DJI and ZEROTECH have every reason to be optimistic about the coming years.",'% robot%'

A bomb was detonated by police at a New Jersey station hours after five people in a SUV were pulled over near New York City's Verrazano Bridge on Sunday night and taken into custody in connection with Saturday's Chelsea bombing.
Officers at Elizabeth train station were startled by the huge bang that erupted without warning just before 1am on Monday morning when a robot cut the wrong wire on one of five devices - causing it to explode.
While there was no immediate sign of damage to the station, authorities warned the public there may be more detonations through the night as they attempt to diffuse the IED's.
'This was an explosive device' containing as many as five devices, said Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage . 'Based on the loudness, I think people could have been seriously hurt'.
Authorities raised the frightening possibility that an active terror cell was currently in the midst of unleashing attacks across New Jersey and New York and around 9.30pm two men discovered up to five suspect packages in the trash and alerted the police.

Factories have struggled to keep up with overseas orders due to the rising labour cost and instead opted for machines, according to a report by China Central Television Station (CCTV).
One boss, from Guangdong Province, said his factory started using robots after they realised the labour cost in China was twice as much as that of Mexico and four times as that of India.
Footage from CCTV shows how two Chinese factories have used robots to replace workers
More and more Chinese factories have opted for machines in order to cut labour cost
One factory, which produces lenses for German brand Carl Zeiss in Guangzhou, replaced 70 workers with robots between 2012 and 2015 and managed to increase the output
A reporter from CCTV visited two robot-equipped factories, both situated in Guangdong Province.
The region, located in southern China, is well-known for its large number of factories handling overseas orders for famous brands including Disney.
One factory, which produces lenses for German brand Carl Zeiss in Guangzhou, started using robots four years ago in a bid to improve productivity and to cut costs.
Its manager Zeng Zhiyong told the reporter that they were informed in 2012 that China's labour cost is twice more expensive than Mexico's and four times more expensive than India's.
Zeng told CCTV: 'We were very surprised at this huge gap and started to think of how to improve productivity.'
Between 2012 and 2015, Zeng cut down the number of workers by 70 people - from 440 to 370 - but managed to increased the output from four million to five million lenses per year.
Rongxin Packaging Corporation produces 1.8 million cans per day.
Impressively, the entire production process does not involve any workers, its general manager Ji Yonghong told CCTV.
However, Ji said the factory has employed younger, more skilled and better-educated workers to maintain the machines and control the quality.
Automated machine, tools and robotics have been marked by Chinese authority as one of the 10 priority sectors of China in the next nine years
Many factories in China have started replacing the workforce with modern technologies
China became the world's largest market for industrial robots in 2013. According to People's Daily Online, more than 20 per cent of the world's industrial robots are purchased by China.
Last year, the Chinese authorities named automated machine, tools and robotics as one of the 10 priority sectors in the 'Made in China 2025' plan, a 10-year plan unveiled by China's State Council in a bid to transform China 'from a manufacturing giant into a world manufacturing power'.
This has prompted many factories in China to start replacing the workforce with modern machines.
Foxconn, the Taiwanese company which assembles iPhones and iPads, has also brought in machines to replace its 60,000 workers in one of its branches in southern China.
The robots took over repetitive tasks and took the place of more than half of the factory's 110,000-strong workforce.
While a growing number of Chinese factories are upgrading its production with high technology, the working conditions of some of them remain worrying.
Previous MailOnline investigations discovered that impoverished men and women from rural areas work 12-hour shifts for £250 a month in Pegatron, a factory in suburban Shanghai which produces Apple products.

China's rapid development in space exploration within the past decade has impressed the world. Martin Barstow, director of Leicester Institute of Space & Earth Observation at the University of Leicester, told Xinhua in a recent interview that China's developing space program is another major milestone towards establishing a permanent presence in space.
""The earlier success of the first space station (Tiangong-1) shows how the program is developing and the new space laboratory will continue to add to China's status as a major space power,"" the professor said.
Former NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao, the first Chinese-American to be commander of the International Space Station, hailed Tiangong-2 as ""another significant step for China's human spaceflight program.""
""China is moving in a very deliberate and orderly fashion to advance their space capability,"" Chiao said. ""I think the technology is good, and they are moving to get more operational experience through TG-2, before the beginning of space station construction.""
Barstow also spoke highly of China's space capability, saying ""China is already a key player in the international space industry,"" and Tiangong-2 will ""enhance"" its well-developed space capability.
Gao Yang, director of Surrey Technology for Autonomous Systems and Robotics (STAR) Lab, said manned spaceflight is of indicative significance in space technology, and China's rapid development in this area is well-known.
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) said in an article published on Thursday that ""Beijing has made space exploration a national priority and is the third country, after the Soviet Union and the U.S., to put astronauts into space.""
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION NEEDED
In different interviews Xinhua carried with space experts, all mentioned the need for international cooperation in space exploration. Space station programs have always been a cradle for countries to work together, Gao said.
Such collaboration has been vividly reflected in the Tiangong-2 mission, which carries, among a number of scientific experiments, an astrophysics detector that is the first space-science experiment built jointly by China with European countries.
POLAR, dedicated to establishing whether the photons from Gama ray bursts (GRBs) -- thought to be a particularly energetic type of stellar explosion -- are polarized, was built largely with Swiss funding, and with the collaboration of Swiss, China and Polish scientists and support from the European Space Agency (ESA), according to the British journal Nature.
POLAR project manager Nicolas Produit, who spoke to Nature, said U.S. law bars NASA from doing joint projects with China's space agencies, but the Chinese Academy of Sciences is discussing a number of other collaborative space projects with the ESA.
Gregory Kulacki, senior analyst and China project manager at the U.S.-based Union of Concerned Scientists' Global Security Program, said that it is encouraging that China intends to solicit international participation in its space station project.
""My hope is that the United States and China will, at an appropriate time in the future, find a way to cooperate in the peaceful exploration of space instead of competing to turn it into a battlefield, as they are now,"" he said.
Chiao said international coperation is ""a common point of interest that helps improve overall relationships. The International Space Station is a great example of that. Many nations came together to build the amazing facility, and we are working together to further science. This helps to improve overall relations between the member countries.""
Barstow believed that more and more countries are seeing the importance of space activity but this will not turn into a race. He said that to benefit smaller economies, a growth of space activity across the world will need to be nurtured by the major agencies like ESA, NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscomos) and China National Space Administration (CNSA).
CHINA'S AMBITIOUS SPACE PROGRAM
China has been actively developing a three-step manned space program since the first decade of the 21st century.
The program's first mission took place in 1999 with the launch of the Shenzhou-1 to examine the performance and reliability of the launcher and verify key technologies relating to capsule connection and separation, heat prevention, control and landing.
The first step, to send an astronaut into space and return safely, was fulfilled by Yang Liwei in the Shenzhou-5 mission in 2003.
The second step was developing advanced space flight techniques and technologies including extra-vehicular activity and orbital docking. This phase also includes the launch of two space laboratories -- effectively mini space-stations that can be manned on a temporary basis.
The next step will be to assemble and operate a permanent manned space station.
China will begin building a space station that is more economically efficient and uses more data than the current International Space Station (ISS), starting as early as 2017, chief engineer of China's manned space program Zhou Jianping told Xinhua on Thursday.
With the ISS set to retire in 2024, the Chinese space station will offer a promising alternative, and it will make China the only country to have a permanent space station after the ISS.",'% robot%'
36,peopleschina,2016-09-16 00:00:00.000000,2016,http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0916/c90000-9115478.html,"JIUQUAN, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- China's Tiangong-2 space lab blasted off on Thursday, marking another milestone in its increasingly ambitious space program, which envisions a mission to Mars by the end of this decade and its own space station by around 2020.
In a cloud of smoke underneath a mid-autumn full moon, Tiangong-2 roared into the air at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China's Gobi desert, on the back of a Long March-2F T2 rocket at 10:04 p.m. Beijing Time.
The Long March-2F T2 is a two-stage launch vehicle that uses four strap-on boosters during its first stage.
About 20 minutes later, the mission was declared a success.
Tiangong-2 separated from the rocket and entered the preset orbit 575 seconds after blast-off, a statement from the mission control read.
While in space, the 8.6-tonne Tiangong-2 will maneuver itself into an orbit about 380 kilometers above Earth for initial in-orbit tests. It will then transfer to a slightly higher orbit of about 393 kilometers above Earth's surface.
Later, the Shenzhou-11 manned spacecraft will carry two astronauts into space to dock with the lab. The astronauts will work in the lab for 30 days before returning to Earth.
In April 2017, China's first space cargo ship Tianzhou-1, which literally means heavenly vessel, will be sent into orbit to dock with the space lab, providing fuel and other supplies.
Wu Ping, deputy director of China's manned space engineering office, said on Wednesday that experts will verify and evaluate key technologies involved with in-orbit refueling and equipment repairs, as well as those related to astronauts' long-term stay in space during the mission.
They will also use the lab, which is designed to operate for at least two years, to conduct space science experiments on a relatively large scale compared to China's previous efforts.
China's manned space program has entered a ""new phase of application and development,"" Wu said.
DREAM LAB
Measuring 10.4 meters in length and up to 3.35 meters in diameter, the tube-like Tiangong-2 is hardly the size of a palace. But its name means heavenly palace in Chinese, and it symbolizes the dream that the Chinese have long envisioned in the sky.
Originally built as a backup to Tiangong-1, Tiangong-2 looks much like its predecessor launched in 2011, but its interior living quarters and life support system have been improved to allow longer astronaut stays.
It is designed to enable two astronauts to live in space for up to 30 days and to receive manned and cargo spaceships.
Once inside Tiangong-2, two astronauts arriving from the Shenzhou-11 spaceship will carry out key experiments related to in-orbit equipment repairs, aerospace medicine, space physics and biology, such as quantum key distribution, atomic space clocks and solar storm research.
""The number of experiments carried out by Tiangong-2 will be the highest of any manned space mission so far,"" said Lyu Congmin with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
According to Zhu Zongpeng, chief designer of China's space lab system, Tiangong-2's workload includes POLAR, a collaboration between Swiss, Polish and Chinese institutions to study gamma ray bursts, the most energetic events in the universe.
A cold atomic space clock, which scientists say only loses one second in about 30 million years, is expected to make future navigation more accurate.
Scientists will also conduct a space-Earth quantum key distribution and laser communications experiment, to facilitate space-to-ground quantum communication.
Also, piggybacking on the Tiangong-2 launch will be a robotic arm that can be used for in-orbit repairs. There will also be a micro satellite that will orbit close to the space lab and snap on to Tiangong-2 and the visiting Shenzhou-11 spacecraft crew.
Earlier reports said Tiangong-2 will also carry out three experiments created by the winners of a Hong Kong middle school design contest.
""Tiangong-2 has a designed life of two years, but it is expected to work much longer than that in space,"" said Zhu.
Both Zhu and Wu referred to Tiangong-2 as China's first space lab ""in the strict sense.""
Its predecessor Tiangong-1, which docked with the Shenzhou-8, Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-10 spaceships and undertook a series of experiments, was mainly used to verify technology involved in space docking and serve as a simple platform for a number of scientific experiments, Wu said.
""In comparison, Tiangong-2 will boast many more experiments,"" said Zhu.
Tiangong-1 ended its data service earlier this year and will, reportedly, burn up as it falls into Earth's atmosphere in the latter half of 2017.
Tiangong-2 will drop into the Pacific Ocean at the end of its mission, according to the manned space engineering office.
TRAILBLAZER
The successful launch of the Tiangong-2, along with the maiden flight of China's new generation carrier rocket Long March-7 in June, bodes well for the final phase of China's three-step manned space program.
The first step, to send an astronaut into space and return safely, was fulfilled by Yang Liwei in the Shenzhou-5 mission in 2003.
The second step is developing advanced space flight techniques and technologies including extra-vehicular activity and orbital docking. This phase also includes the launch of two space laboratories - effectively mini space-stations that can be manned on a temporary basis.
Finally, the third step will be to assemble and operate a permanent manned space station.
It is expected that the space station will consist of three parts -- a core module attached to two space labs, each weighing about 20 tonnes.
According to Zhou Jianping, chief engineer of China's manned space program, one important target of Tiangong-2 is to verify technology involved in the construction of the space station.
""It has the basic technological capacity of a space station,"" Zhou said.
""Once the space lab mission comes to an end, China will start building our own space station,"" he said, adding this could start in as early as 2017.
Construction of the space station is planned for completion by around 2020.
It will enter into service around 2022, with an initial designed life of at least 10 years, Zhu Zongpeng told Xinhua. By then, astronauts could be stationed in orbit for missions that last more than one year, he added.
The Chinese space station will be much smaller than the current International Space Station (ISS), which weigh 420 tonnes, but it can be expanded for ""scientific research and international cooperation,"" Zhou said.
With the ISS set to retire in 2024, the Chinese station will offer a promising alternative, and China will be the only country with a permanent space station.
According to Zhou, the Chinese space station will be more ""economically efficient and informationized"" than the ISS. It will be able to house a maximum of six astronauts at the same time and manned missions will become routine once the space station enters service.
Starting from scratch, China's ever-expanding multi-billion-dollar space program is increasingly becoming a source of national pride and a marker of technological expertise in the global community.
After launching its first manned mission in 2003, China staged a spacewalk in 2008, and sent Tiangong-1 into space in 2011.
It succeeded in a manned docking in space in 2012, becoming the third country to do so after the United States and Russia, and landed its Yutu rover on the moon a year later.
Now China is preparing Tianhe-1, a core space station module, which may be lifted by the powerful Chinese rocket Long March-5 in 2018. Additionally, Chinese scientists are making a Hubble-like telescope to orbit near the planned space station.
China also aims to send the Chang'e-5 probe to the moon and return with lunar samples in the second half of 2017, and to land a probe on Mars by 2021.",'% robot%'

In comparison, a similar but unintelligent foreign-made fire extinguishing system costs 400,000 yuan. Such huge price gap is because Diao hopes the advanced technology will also be used by the general public, which is sensitive to price, rather than only by big companies.
""Only when the technology is promoted and popularized in every part of the society can its value be fully realized and benefit all people,"" said Diao.
Achieving this goal is not easy. When he first developed the technology, the cost was very high. To lower it, Diao challenged himself by making many additional experiments until the cost dropped to a price range that satisfied him and that the civil use market can accept.

The Communist Party of China, CPC holds its 19th national congress on October 18, 2017 in the capital, Beijing, with an air of assurance and confidence. Party members will assemble to chart out the country’s development and political path for the next five years and even beyond. There is assurance because the party under the leadership and guidance of Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, has since the last congress five years ago steered the country to steady economic growth and increasing international clout.
Zhejiang’s superlative economic gains
One glaring example of the CPC’s successful political, economic and social stewardship is the southeastern coastal Zhejiang Province. With a population of 55.9 million people, the 2016 Gross Domestic Product, GDP of 710 billion US dollars was the first amongst all of China’s provinces and autonomous regions. Some 60 per cent of the amount came from the private sector that also provides over 90 per cent of provincial jobs.
Zhejiang eradicated poverty in 2015, five years ahead of the national target in 2020. The province’s total trade volume in 2016 was 326 billion US dollars or over 8 per cent of the national figure. Meanwhile, economic growth in the first half of 2017 stood at 8 per cent. On the other hand, Ningbo has been the biggest global commodity port for 8 years running.
Economic growth averaged 10 per cent in almost 40 years of reform and opening up; while per capita GDP is now at 12,784 US dollars. Similarly, rural Zhejiang incomes have been ranked the first in China for 31 straight years. Zhejiang’s exports in 2016 ranked 20th in the world, way ahead of several nations. Also, foreign enterprises invested 470 billion US dollars in 2016 as the province carried out business with 142 nations.
Perhaps, the most significant of Zhejiang’s milestones is the decision by America’s Boeing aircraft to set up a manufacturing base in the province, the first time the company did so outside the US. All these superlative gains only point to one conclusion - that Zhejiang Province can safely be described as China’s current economic powerhouse. This is the big provincial picture. At the local level, there is also much to show for Zhejiang’s meteoric development.
Alibaba blazes trail in e-commerce
Zhejiang is the home province of Jack Ma, founder of the renowned international online retail platform, Alibaba Group. From a humble beginning from his Hangzhou apartment in 1999 with 18 employees, Alibaba now employs 50,000 people across the world, 20,000 of them based in Zhejiang. Despite shutting down for some time in 2003 during the SARS virus outbreak, Alibaba staff continued working from home, strategizing how to make the company a global brand.
Today, the company is the world’s largest online retail platform with over 500 million active monthly users. Company officials say they plan to create 100 million jobs worldwide in the next 20 years, have 2 billion consumers and enhance technology research to boost healthcare, cloud computing, traffic flow in cities and the use of more efficient robots to move goods faster.

After Guangzhou in Guangdong Province, Yiwu has the second largest African population in any Chinese city. According to local authorities, there are 760,000 registered local people in Yiwu, compared to 1.16 million foreigners, with about 3,000 being Africans. This mix has over the years facilitated people-to-people exchanges, intermarriages, mutual cultural understanding, tourism, foreign trade and investments. This is seen in the establishment by Zhejiang and its local governments of friendship city relations with 12 African nations. The Presidents of Uganda, Namibia and Sudan are amongst the city’s most prominent recent visitors.
One of Yiwu’s leading companies is Neoglory, which today counts amongst China’s 500 top companies. Founded in 1978, Neoglory began trading in jewelry before expanding to other sectors like real estate, trade, finance, investment, etc. On the other hand, Yiwu boasts the world’s largest retail market and is commonly referred to as the “world’s capital of small commodities.” The International Commerce and Trading City or retail market covers 6.4 square million metres.

""Xiaofa explains complicated legal terms in everyday language to help the public better understand legal definitions,"" said Du Xiangyang, founder and CEO of AEGIS Data, which designed Xiaofa. ""We used a child's voice to ease the tense emotions of litigants who come here for help.""
The robot can move its head and wave its hands as instructions show up on screen, and it can guide people to the exact service window for litigation services.
The appearance of Xiaofa was a big move for the Beijing court, as the capital works to build a ""smart"" court system. Over 40,000 litigation questions and 30,000 legal issues can be answered by the robot, according to the court.
""Interaction between humans and machines has improved immensely,"" said Ma Laike, deputy head of Beijing No 1 Intermediate People's Court. ""It will decrease the cost of litigation, save trial resources and improve the efficiency of justice.""
Before the robot was introduced into the Beijing court system, it was tested by legal professionals.
In October 2016, China's first AI legal robot, Faxiaotao, was unveiled in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, attracting visitors from home and abroad.
Faxiaotao can help people analyze the best way to solve a dispute, and also assist them in selecting which attorneys are suitable to accept the case, according to the robot's designer, Itslaw, a company that combines internet technology with law.
For example, if a company's corporate client believes its advertisements or advertising slogans have been illegally copied by a rival company and would like to hire an attorney who is a specialist, Faxiaotao will first recognize what kind of case it is and then analyze its database for suitable lawyers who have dealt with similar disputes.
More than 300,000 attorneys across the country were listed in the company's database last year. When a query is made it selects the best three options, the company said.
The Supreme People's Court has ordered Chinese courts at all levels to build technology-friendly systems for lawsuits and explore the use of big data and AI to help judges and litigants search documents and resolve cases.

Chinese authorities said they will earmark a 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) special fund to support the country’s “Made in China 2025” initiative, the Xinhua-run Economic Information Daily reported on Oct. 12.
The money will be used to boost innovation in the manufacturing sector, strengthen industrial chain coordination, build a generic technology services platform, and carry out an insurance program for the application of new materials, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said in a recent notice.
An estimated 25 projects will be financially supported, including Internet of Things, new materials, smart appliances, high-end consumer electronics, industrial information, and security control and infant formula quality control, the MIIT disclosed.
Each project will get from 30 to 50 million yuan of financial support, industry authorities said, and key projects will receive over 100 million yuan for development. Industry and information technology departments at all levels across the country have unveiled plans to offer financial assistance to key projects in their provinces.
For instance, starting from last year, Guangdong has invested over one billion yuan into robotics, rail transportation, biomedicine, integrated circuits, and intelligent equipment.
The MIIT has signed an agreement with the National Development Bank (NDB) to aid pilot projects that are preferred by the market. The NDB has pledged that it will offer no less than 300 billion yuan of financial support to the “Made in China 2025” initiative from 2016 to 2020.

""Judging from what has been done in the past five years, we can already say that the next five years are going to be even more successful,"" Rwandan Ambassador to China Charles Kayonga told China Daily.
The guests were invited to Beijing Exhibition Hall to have a closer look at China's recent achievements.
As of Friday, the exhibition, Five Years of Sheer Endeavor, had racked up a total of nearly 480,000 visitors since it opened on Sept 25.
Many residents have lined up for tickets to the display, which includes models of China's cutting-edge machinery and equipment that are rarely put on display.
It employs virtual reality technology as well as panoramic slideshows to enhance the experience.
""China is now becoming a country that's more of an innovator rather a country that relies on the technology of other nations, so that is a very good sign,"" said Edwin Maher, a visiting professor of journalism studies at the Communication University of China.
""It has been made very clear that China is very much leading in many, many sectors of world technologies and science,"" said Maher, who has been in China for 14 years and was once a news anchor on China Central Television's English Channel.
Around a decade ago, Maher was awarded the Friendship Award, the highest honor that a foreign expert or outstanding achiever can receive from the Chinese government.
""The huge telescope that's been opened and the continuing development of the high-speed train system are also some things I am very interested in,"" he added as he toured the displays.
Maher said that over the past year and a half, measures taken to improve the environment have really been felt in China, especially in Beijing.

LONDON, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Theresa May relived Sunday the ordeal of her disastrous party conference speech, insisting ""I am resilient"".
In her first major interview since Wednesday's conference fiasco when a prankster interrupted her speech, her coughing fits and the stage backdrop falling apart, May said at no time did she think of giving up.
In an exclusive interview in the Sunday Times newspaper, May was asked if she had cried or been depressed in the aftermath of her speech.
She replied: ""One minute journalists are accusing me of being an ice maiden or a robot, then they claim I'm a weeping woman in dire need of a good night's sleep! The truth is my feelings can be hurt, like everyone else, but I am pretty resilient.""
May said at no point did she feel like leaving the stage when things went wrong, adding, ""I am a very determined person.""
Describing what gave her the guts to plough on, May said the speech had not been the easiest in her life.
""But I had an important message to deliver and I was determined to do that. It didn't feel like I was alone up there, it felt like everyone in the room was with me and willing me on and that made a huge difference,"" she said.
Asked if the speech was the worse day of her life, May described it as just a speech, adding that she had had to deal with horrific events such as the ""appalling Grenfell Tower fire and loss of life"".
""In my life there have, of course, been difficult times but what motivates me is giving a voice to those who struggle to be heard,"" she said.
Asked if she feared for her own safety when the prankster approached her during the speech, May said: ""I wasn't concerned for my safety, there was nothing about his body language that gave me cause for alarm. I have protection people who are fantastic. They look out for me and I trust them completely. I cannot imagine many people watching found the prank funny, though.""
May also said it was hugely important that leaders do not become shut off from the public.
""We need to get out there to make our case, to listen to what really matters to people and to learn what we can do to make their lives better,"" she said.
She said from a group of men she met on a stag do in Tallinn last week to the people she talked to when knocking on doors, she rarely meet anything other than warmth, wit and wisdom.
Other media reports Sunday speculated that May was planning to reshuffle her top-team cabinet, with under-fire Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson a possible casualty of a shake-up.
In her Sunday Times interview, May gave no hint of her intentions, apart from describing her cabinet as ""terrific"".
She said; ""I'm the PM and part of my job is to make sure I always have the best people in my cabinet, to make the most of the wealth of talent available in the party. I have a terrific cabinet. For me leadership is not gossip and game-playing.""

The pledge accords with General Secretary Xi Jinping's call to ""move Chinese industries up to the medium-high end of the global value chain, and foster a number of world-class advanced manufacturing clusters"".
Beijing has completed the top-level design of the grand plan, which is the first decade of a program of actions to marshal the country's high-end manufacturing horsepower, said Miao Wei, minister of industry and information technology.
To shore up the ambition, continued efforts will be devoted to the setting up of a national center for manufacturing innovation, intelligent manufacturing, creation of a strong industrial base, green manufacturing and high-end equipment innovation, he said on the sidelines of the 19th CPC National Congress.
""In the past two years, China has seen the establishment of the likes of National Power Battery Innovation and 35 provincial-level manufacturing innovation centers, which greatly boosted the country's prowess in core technological breakthroughs,"" he said.
The goal to move up the industrial value chain is gaining substantial steam, with the ministry unveiling a total of 97 intelligent manufacturing pilot projects on Monday.
They covered a wide range of high-tech industries such as robotics and vehicles and involved companies like Beiqi Foton Motor Co Ltd and Lepu Medical Technology (Beijing) Co Ltd.
Such endeavors are set to transform the traditional manufacturing sector into an open and digitally linked manufacturing platform, with networks of hardware suppliers, developers, designers and entrepreneurs, said Denis Depoux, Asia deputy president of Roland Berger.
""For instance, factories can deliver manufacturing as a service to small and medium-sized enterprises and even to individual customers,"" he said.
Meanwhile, China will continue to push ahead with the construction of 31 national demonstration zones, which are located across 12 cities including Ningbo and four city clusters in regions such as southern Jiangsu province, the minister noted.
Miao also said China is on pace to pioneer a number of key technology upgrade projects, without specifying, and constantly optimize the environment for the manufacturing sector.

Late last month, a 2,000-kilometer-long quantum fiber link, the longest and most sophisticated in the world, was launched to connect Beijing and Shanghai and provide an unhackable communications route between the cities.
During the link's launch in Beijing, Bai Chunli, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, used Micius, the world's first quantum communication satellite which was launched by China last year, to make the first intercontinental quantum video call and spoke with Anton Zeilinger, his Austrian counterpart, in Vienna.
The breakthrough in quantum communication is one of a number of scientific achievements made by China in the past five years. Thanks to strong policy support and a growing pool of talent that is constantly pushing the envelope of technology, the world's second-largest economy is rapidly being transformed from a follower to a global leader in innovation.
The shift is in line with the call by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, on Wednesday for more efforts to make China into a country of innovators and reach the frontiers of science and technology.
Innovation is the primary force driving development, and it is the strategic underpinning for building a modernized economy, Xi said in a report delivered to the CPC's 19th National Congress.
""We will strengthen basic research in applied sciences, launch major national science and technology projects, and prioritize innovation in key generic technologies, cutting-edge frontier technologies, modern engineering technologies, and disruptive technologies,"" the president added.
Progress has already been made in the past five years, and China has emerged as a leader in the field of technology, with breakthroughs ranging from the maiden flight of the country's first homegrown large passenger aircraft to the debut of the fastest train in the world, from the Beidou Navigation Satellite System, which is set to cover the world by 2020, to robotics and artificial intelligence technologies that are widely regarded as the next frontier of growth.
According to the 2017 report of the World Intellectual Property Organization, China is the only middle-income country in the list of the world's top 25 most innovative economies, where it is ranked 22nd.
The achievement was lauded by Wan Gang, minister of Science and Technology, who said, ""On the whole, we have met the goal of 'occupying a place' in the major fields of science and technology, which lays a sound foundation for China to be an innovation powerhouse.""
Meanwhile, a special issue of the scientific journal Nature noted that ""Chinese science has been moving at breakneck speed for the past few decades, fueled by vast infusions of cash and a rapidly growing technical workforce.""

Outstripping competition
According to Nature, China now boasts more researchers than the United States, outspends the European Union in research and development and ""is on track to best all other nations in its yearly production of scientific papers"".
Bai, from CAS, commented: ""Important scientific work has mushroomed in China in recent years. It is the result of years of research and development. Policy guidance, financial support and continued efforts to deepen reform have all played parts in stimulating this vitality.""
More important, according to analysts, scientific research has been efficiently commercialized, with China pouring large sums into the latter stages of the R&D process, during which discoveries are turned into products.
High-speed rail has been one of the most impressive areas of progress. In recent years, China has built the world's largest high-speed rail network and become a world leader in providing globally competitive high-speed products and services.
By 2020, China Railway Rolling Stock Corp, which manufacturers the country's high-speed trains, is expected to supply new bullet trains with a maximum operating speed of 400 kilometers per hour to markets related to the Belt and Road Initiative. The new trains will also cut per passenger energy consumption by 10 percent, compared with trains that run at 350 km/h.
""Over the past few years, China has demonstrated its competitive edge in high-speed rail technology,"" said Wang Mengshu, a railway expert and a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Navigating the future
After it was confirmed that Beidou, the homegrown navigation satellite system, covered the entire Asia-Pacific region in 2012, several more satellites were launched, enabling wider applications in logistics, aviation, precision farming and other industries that demand high-accuracy positioning.
Earlier this month, for the first time, Beidou was used to guide a Chinese-developed regional jetliner as it successfully completed a test flight at an airport in the eastern province of Shandong.
The flight demonstrated that Beidou's performance is on a par with similar systems produced overseas and meets internationally advanced levels in transient and quick positioning index, according to the plane's manufacturer, Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China.

Meanwhile, a tide of innovation is sweeping China, helping the country to evolve from an ""innovation sponge"", absorbing and adapting existing technology and knowledge from around the world, into a global leader in innovation, spawning a wide range of homegrown cutting-edge products and services.
Nothing better demonstrates this than the bike-sharing phenomenon. Created by Chinese players, including Ofo and Mobike, GPS-enabled, dockless bikes are now improving the lives of people in big cities at home and abroad who are fed up with congested roads and long for zero-emissions forms of transportation.
In September, Ofo announced that it would launch its services in four European countries?the Czech Republic, Italy, Russia and the Netherlands?moving the company closer to meeting its ambitious goal of entering 200 cities in 20 countries by the end of the year.
""In stark contrast to the previous generation of Chinese companies that focused on domestic growth until the market became saturated, emerging startups are better at coming up with their own ideas and better aware of the opportunities abroad,"" said Zhang Xu, an analyst at Analysys, a market researcher in Beijing.
The surge in mass entrepreneurship and innovation, buoyed by favorable government policies, is noticeable. By the end of last year, the country had nearly 26 million registered private and State-owned businesses, a rise of 18.8 percent from the previous year, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.
More important, 71 internet companies are ""unicorns"", that is, private businesses valued at more than $1 billion each. Notably, four of them?Didi Chuxing, Xiaomi, Lu and Meituan-Dianping?have made the list of the world's 10 most valuable unicorns.
According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China's artificial intelligence sector is now equal to those in leading global powers in terms of voice, image and semantics recognition technologies.
Li Shu, a partner at Boston Consulting said: ""China is a global pioneer in the field of internet development, as the growth in the number of netizens and the volume of internet consumption both top the corresponding rates in other nations. We have found that innovation permeates much quicker in China than the United States because Chinese netizens are more willing to accept new applications.""
Online shopping
For example, online shopping is now the norm for hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers. The advent of e-commerce, online payment and courier services means consumers can have goods delivered to their doorsteps within hours with just a few taps on their mobile gadgets.
In the past five years, China's online retail market has surged from 1.3 trillion yuan ($196.5 billion) to 5.2 trillion yuan, raising living standards in both big cities and villages, according to a report released this month by Alibaba's research unit.
Juggernauts such as Alibaba and JD.com have lured shoppers through the use of annual discount shopping galas that could eventually eclipse Black Friday in the US.
Moreover, smaller players are pushing ahead with the digital shopping frenzy by connecting a larger number of affluent Chinese with a wide array of foreign goods, while companies such as Red and Kaola, which is owned by NetEase, are heavily promoting cross-border e-commerce.
Market researcher eMarketer estimates that by 2020, half of China's digital shoppers-about one-quarter of the country's population of 1.4 billion?will be buying foreign products online and total sales will top $157 billion.
Likewise, the country's mobile payment industry has made its mark in the outside world by moving away from its original function of simply facilitating transactions and embracing new activities such as wealth management, credit scoring and utility bill payments.
Girish Ramachandran, Asia-Pacific president of Tata Consultancy Services, India's largest information technology company, said China's rapid strides in digital technologies and innovation capability have indirectly inspired India to digitize its economy.
For example, Ant Financial Services, the owner of China's largest mobile payment service, has brought its wireless payment solutions to its Indian counterpart Paytm.com, and the two signed an agreement in 2015 to create a local version of Alipay.

During these five years, many internal and external events occurred, both with negative and positive influences. However, this all corroborated that it is essential to have adequate planning to face all kinds of adversities.
Externally, there were political, economic, and social issues that affected much of the world, either directly or indirectly. In working toward the goal of the “China Dream,” it was necessary to be united, determined, and competent.
Marriage is necessary for the success of any country. The government, the Party, the military, and the people must all be on the same page. In this way, it was possible to give all Chinese a ""moderately prosperous life"" and advance the goal of poverty eradication. Being close to the population and listening to their suggestions and complaints is fundamental to keeping the Party on the right course, and China has mastered this strategy.
Another critical variable was determination. Over the past few years, President Xi has emphasized and carried out essential steps toward deepening reforms.
This has been fundamental because besides from demanding political will, a great determination was necessary to change or alter wrong courses. The Chinese government has acted steadily, but other essential reforms remain for the next administration.
Finally, the last variable that contributed to the success was competence. We will now present the hypothetical Governance Model of President Xi Jinping, which we have consolidated into six main pillars. We will cite from recent political and economic achievements of the government.
The six pillars are: National Sovereignty, Deepening of Reforms and Rights, Educational and Cultural Development, Economic Development and Environment, Foreign Policy, and Creation and Monitoring of Institutional Norms.
In the last five years, I have highlighted the following about National Sovereignty. For example, the implantation of the modernization of the armed forces, the fair recognition of the value of the military, the development of deterrent and informatization capacities, creation of strong ties through the concept of duality, where military and civilians began working partnerships to generate products with higher added value.
The firm position was maintained on the legitimacy of Chinese Sovereignty in the South China Sea and the start of the strategic ""Grand Bay"" project that integrates Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau.
Regarding the deepening of reforms and rights, we highlight several actions to combat poverty and carry out tax reforms, reforms in the financial market, and changes in judicial bodies.
Regarding health, China has increased housing for the needy and has taken actions such as hospital reforms and creating better financial conditions for doctors and other health professionals
Regarding educational and cultural development, we highlight the effort to adapt education to the new world technological context. And regarding culture, there was the more significant dissemination of Chinese culture, improvements in the maintenance of cultural heritage, and the encouragement of the population to carry out tourism within China.
Concerning economic development and the environment, we highlight macroeconomic policies to equalize economic growth under the conditions of the ""New Normal,"" policies to encourage the services sector, facilitation of foreign capital investments, and development of innovation within the new context of the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"" among other necessary measures.
About the environment, the government reinforced measures to improve the situation through the deactivation or restructuring of ""zombie companies,"" the creation of more environmentally friendly locations, such as ""Ecological Buildings,"" and a firm policy against environmental polluters.
In foreign policy, the government acted in several areas, depending on the characteristics of the other country. For example, we highlight discussions on the issues of nuclear arms control, counter-terrorism, combating social inequality and eradicating poverty, the development of the grand world-wide strategic plan for Belt and Road, and other critical related actions.
Finally, subjects on the creation and monitoring of institutional norms showed us two critical actions. First, the policy of the government-party-population approach, which as we said was of utmost importance to China's success, and two, the government's vigorous activity against waste and especially in the fight against corruption.
What challenges and measures can be discussed and determined at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party for the next administration?
This question is incredibly complex, because of the planning required for the next five years of a country as great and important as China.
I will outline some challenges and some guidelines, which in my opinion, may arise at this critical meeting.
”""Innovation"" will certainly be one of the most important issues over the next five years. That's because, we know we're going through the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution,"" and its effects will be massive in most activities. Also, there are still enormous tasks for the Chinese government to look at and use their resolve to solve many challenges.
Regarding National Sovereignty, I believe that the insertion of ""cyber-physical"" systems will be intense in the processes of manufacturing equipment for national defense. Also, the Chinese government has determined that the development of military equipment, where possible, obey the principle of duality. This means that defense companies and private companies must work together more closely in the development of new equipment. In this context, ""cybersecurity"" should also have a special treatment, because its control will be fundamental to the sovereignty of any country.
I do not doubt that through ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,"" China will achieve its goal of building a moderately prosperous society, but it will be necessary to worry about some essential aspects.
For example, the process of deepening social reforms has very similar characteristics in any country in the world. First, improvements are more accessible to carry out, but once the process increases, the pace slows down, and more determined the government and Party will need to be to implement them.
An essential subject that must also be addressed will be how to prepare young people from their studies to their work.
In this new digital world, there isno way to follow old ways. The modernizations and demands of potential employers will have a very significant diversity and speed of change.
Therefore, I believestudents will need to be matched with the demand of companies. I only see one way. Educational institutions and companies must work together to create curriculum. With this, the number of unemployed young people will be reduced. The need for more vocational schools and startups in China also emerges.
In defining the growth of the economy for the next few years, not only should macroeconomic fundamentals be considered, but these technological and structural changes in productive modes should be predicted.
This is not an easy task, because every day new combinations of tools and sectors arise that focus on changing demands. However, I believe that among other areas of knowledge: nanotechnology, robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and energy storage systems, among others, should be the new priority.
Lastly, we must speak of measures for the tireless fight against corruption, which is being improved every day.

(Xinhua/Meng Lijing)
BEIJING, Nov. 4 -- International scholars spoke highly of China's launch on Thursday of its first heavy-lift rocket, saying it will lay the foundation for China's future launch of rockets with heavier payload capabilities.
China launched Long March-5 from the coastal Wenchang Space Launch Center in southern Hainan Province, in a bid to verify the design and performance of the new rocket and test the rocket's flight program. With the heavy-lift carrier rocket, China can build a permanent manned space station and explore the moon and Mars.
The successful launch reflects China's ""greatest advancement"" in developing a new launcher family for both its un-crewed and crewed space programs, said Charles Vick, senior technical & space policy analyst with U.S. think tank globalsecurity.org.
""Eventually once the Long March-5 has gained high reliability, it will serve several mission for the crewed lunar program efforts and may become the crew launch vehicle for the eventual crewed lunar landing programs in planning,"" Vick told Xinhua.
Instead of highly toxic propellants, the new series, also consisting of Long March 6 and 7, uses kerosene and liquid oxygen, making it more environmental friendly and less expensive.
Vick said he was impressed that this new Long March series was developed without Russian rocket engine technology know-how and American cryogenic technology involved.
Gao Yang, director of British Surrey Technology for Autonomous Systems and Robotics (STAR) Lab, told Xinhua that the technology of the Long March-5 has proved not inferior to heavy carrier rockets developed by other nations.
She added that the stunning carrying capacity of the Long March-5 represents China's rising capabilities and competence in this aspect, noting China's progress in space technology will, to a large extent, increase its influence in future international cooperation.
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported Thursday that ""the Long March-5 gives China the capability to orbit the heaviest of payloads - such as big telecoms spacecraft and sections of its future astronaut space station.""
""This puts the Long March-5 in the same class as America's current most powerful rocket - the Delta-IV Heavy,"" BBC noted.
Alexander Zheleznyakov, a member of the Tsiolkovsky Russian Academy of Cosmonautics, told xinhua that Long March-5 will remarkably raise China's competitive edge in the international commercial launch market.
As for the rocket's technical advantage, Zheleznyakov said the notable operability within its inner systems will help facilitate its production and decrease costs, which is key to its future commercialization.
China is now developing a mega rocket with the capacity of sending up to 100 tonnes of payload to low-Earth orbit. Its maiden flight will probably take place before 2030.",'% robot%'

Lu Kang, spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said the interference runs counter to China-Germany trade and investment cooperation.
""For a long time, the trade investment between China and Germany has been following the principle of mutual benefit and win-win results, which has brought about real benefits to both sides. If Germany allows a third-party's interference, out of various interests-involved considerations when evaluating a normal investment act between enterprises of the two countries based on commercial principles, it might run against the original intention of China-Germany economic and trade cooperation on investment and will not benefit the interests of enterprises and peoples of the two countries.""

China should quicken its pace in setting industrial standards for robotics manufacturing, as the lack of safety regulations may pose potential hazards to humans, experts say.
“The development of service robots has already become a new trend. Such robots will directly serve humans, which means a high standard for safety and mechanical capacity should be imposed on the robotics industry,” said Fan Jianping, head of the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to Xinhua News Agency.
Fan’s remarks came after a robot named “Little Chubby” malfunctioned and sent a bystander to the hospital during the Hi-tech Fair held in Shenzhen earlier this month. Though the organizer of the fair claimed that the problem was caused by human error, the incident has nevertheless incited public concerns about the safety and quality of robots.
“The incident has revealed the problem caused by a lack of industrial standards. Currently, China’s robotics manufacturing industry is still in an exploratory stage. There are no specific regulations to tackle problems and hazards created by robots,” Fan said.
Echoing Fan, other experts also noted that, due to China’s growing elderly population, robots may soon be deployed to care for elderly citizens. For that reason and others, safety hazards cannot be tolerated.

The joy of winning didn't last long, however. Participants hoping to move on to the next round are required to pay a fee of 43,000 RMB ($6,200) to take part in the final in Medellin, Colombia. According to Wang, the fee is approximately equal to the average annual income of a rural family in the region, and they could not raise the funds in time for the competition, as the deadline to sign up was March 10.
“In addition to the 43,000 RMB, we would still need at least another 10,000 to buy the necessary equipment. We saw no hope of resolving this financial problem, so we had to give up the contest,” explained Wang.

NASA found the spacecraft by using a new technological application of ground-based interplanetary radar and said it's still circling some 200 kilometers above the lunar surface.
This new technique also discovered an active spacecraft orbiting the moon, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO).
LRO was launched on June 18, 2009, while India's Chandrayaan-1 was launched on October 22, 2008.
""Finding LRO was relatively easy, as we were working with the mission's navigators and had precise orbit data where it was located,"" Marina Brozovic, a radar scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and principal investigator for the test project, said in a statement this week.
""Finding India's Chandrayaan-1 required a bit more detective work because the last contact with the spacecraft was in August of 2009.""
More troubling was that the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft is very small, about half the size of a smart car, and about 380,000 kilometers away.
To find the spacecraft, the team used NASA's 70-meter antenna at the agency's Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California to send out a powerful beam of microwaves directed toward the moon.

Realizing the dilemma years earlier, China has given its prescription by prioritizing the robot industry in manufacturing sector.
“Right now, the human worker who does, say, 50,000 dollars worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed . . . If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you’d think that we’d tax the robot at a similar level,” Gates said in a recent interview.
The world's wealthiest man suggested that tax be used as a way to fund other types of employment, such as retraining of workers replaced by robots.
Expert believed that the billionaire’s “odd idea” was, in essence, seeking for a balance between rising efficiency brought by automation and the care for human interests, especially for the vulnerable groups.
Li Xiaohua, a research fellow with the Institute of Industrial Economics under Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), at the same time pointed out that if a certain country imposes tax on robots, its manufacturing industry’s competence will be impeded because of slower rise of efficiency.
The export will then be affected by lower manufacturing efficiency, and more jobs will be slashed as a result, he added.
A new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is emerging, so it’s not a wise move to tax on robots and artificial intelligence since such decision will slow down the intellectualization process, Li explained.
Both robots and artificial intelligence are core of new economy represented by smart manufacturing, he added.
The stagnancy of China's manufacturing industry, if persists, will cause loss to factories with low efficiency or financial deficit. Therefore, the industry, pressed with the waning demographic dividend and rising labor cost, is in urgent need to be transformed and upgraded.
The farsighted Chinese government has realized the challenges earlier.In the ""Made in China 2025"" plan rolled out by State Council in 2015, industry robot was defined as a key player to shift the country away from low-end manufacturing.
It also listed robot industry a direction of future development, in a hope to upgrade the manufacturing sector into a digitized, intelligent industry with large sizes and completed system.

Soft robots are constructed with materials like silicone, plastic, fabric, rubber or compliant mechanical parts like springs.
""The softness makes it possible for the robots to work more effectively and safely with humans and can be used for rehabilitation and recovery or in the service sector,"" said Wang Tianmiao, a robotics engineer at the university.
The robotic soft arm is inspired by the tentacles of octopus, Wang said, ""It can bend and swirl quickly, and the suction cups help it adhere tightly to objects of different shapes and sizes.""
In five to ten years, the robotic arm is expected to be used in minimal-invasive surgery and athletic rehabilitation, said Wen Li, associate professor in Beihang University and head of the team.",'% robot%'

NANJING, March 28 -- Chinese scientists are building the world's largest multifunctional research platform for nano-science and nano-technology that could help develop more powerful computers and more intelligent robots.
The Vacuum Interconnected Nano-X Research Facility in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, integrates the state-of-art capabilities of material growth, device fabrication and testing in one ultra-high vacuum environment, said Ding Sunan, deputy director of the project.
""We are exploring a new technology route of nano-scale devices production on the platform, which simulates the ultra-high vacuum environment of space,"" said Ding, a researcher at the Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Nano-X has received initial funding of 320 million yuan (about 46.5 million U.S. dollars), and will eventually have a budget of 1.5 billion yuan.
Construction on the first stage began in 2014 and is expected to be completed in 2018. It comprises 100-meter-long ultra-high vacuum pipelines connecting 30 pieces of equipment. Ultimately the facility will have ultra-high vacuum pipelines of about 500 meters, connecting more than 100 large pieces of equipment, Ding said.
Nano-X is designed as a complete system for materials growth, device fabrication and testing. All samples can be transferred accurately, quickly and smoothly among all tools in an ultra-high vacuum environment.
The facility can prevent surface contamination from the air, keeping a material's intrinsic properties unchanged and realizing quantum manipulation and control, said Ding.
Experts say it will help make breakthroughs in common and critical problems in materials science and device technology, and develop new manufacturing technologies of nano-materials and core devices in the fields of energy and information.
Nano-X is expected to be incorporated into China's national research infrastructure system, and become a world-class open platform for research and development in nano-science and nano-technology, providing advanced technical support for the national strategy of high technologies.",'% robot%'

[Photo/Xinhua]
President Xi Jinping's call for inclusive and sustainable globalization received international recognition and support at the Boao Forum for Asia, with participants agreeing that greater inclusiveness and fairness are needed to ensure shared benefits and common prosperity.
Political leaders, academics and entrepreneurs from home and abroad attending the forum in Hainan province acknowledged China's role in not only defending globalization but also mobilizing coordinated efforts to address the problems and fix the flaws in the global economic system, observers said. The forum ended on Sunday.
In a letter, Xi called on forum participants to pool their wisdom to solve the major problems facing the world and regional economies and to push a more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable globalization process.
Xi said that the theme of the forum?Globalization and Free Trade: The Asian Perspectives?reflected the keen attention on the issue from the international community, especially in Asia.
The president lauded the role of the forum in building an Asian consensus, promoting Asian cooperation and upgrading Asian influence since its establishment 16 years ago.
Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli, in his keynote speech, stressed that Asian countries should collectively push for a more inclusive globalization, promote balanced and fair development and reform global economic governance.
Forum participants' statements showed their recognition that globalization is an inevitable trend and a natural outcome of scientific breakthroughs and technological progress that have enabled many countries to achieve substantial economic and social progress.
But they pointed out pressing issues such as widened inequality and fragmentation of global trade, which should not be neglected as trade and investment are liberalized.
In a joint declaration, members of the forum said that reversing globalization is unlikely to solve problems, and could even create new challenges for global growth. They agreed that the world must adapt to the globalization trend and reform global governance.
Former French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said that multilateralism should increase the inclusiveness of globalization, warning that ""ever-increasing"" bilateral interactions could cause trade imbalances.
""We see the tendency of countries to go around multilateral systems such as the United Nations. If we want to ensure the inclusiveness of globalization, we need multilateral arrangements and all participants sitting at the table,"" he said.
Hans-Paul Burkner, chairman of the Boston Consulting Group, a US-based worldwide company, said globalization has benefited the majority of people in the world and countries should work together to promote fair trade and to address the challenges facing globalization.
""As we go forward, with tension and protectionist measures rising, we need to continue to open up and to encourage the fair exchange of goods and services as President Xi also mentioned ... and to make sure it is win-win,"" he said.
While recognizing the positive role of globalization, Nepali Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal noted that imbalances in its benefits are evidenced by the expressions in some countries of people feeling marginalized.
He said Asia is an ideal region to lead the next phase of globalization, and future efforts should focus on increasing inclusiveness to avoid dividing people into winners and losers.
Forum participants said they also agreed that stepping up domestic structural reforms, facilitating innovation to generate new businesses and jobs, and taking effective measures to deal with the cost of free trade will help solve problems in the globalized world.
Jin Liqun, president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, said that blaming globalization works in no one's interest and governments should improve their social and economic policies to address the downsides of globalization, such as the loss of jobs in some sectors.
Former US secretary of commerce Carlos Gutierrez pointed out that governments should focus on preparing for the rapid development of robotics and automation rather than blaming globalization as a cause of unemployment.
""The biggest threat in the future is not trade and globalization but robotics, as millions of jobs could be lost because of that. ... Governments should retrain people who lose their jobs so they can get new skills that will be relevant in the future,"" he said.",'% robot%'

The world economy has been in a low-growth trap for five years, as persistent growth shortfalls have weighed on future output expectations while widening productivity gaps contributed to rising inequality.
Speaking in Beijing over the weekend, Gabriela Ramos, Chief of Staff of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), explained that the challenges facing the world economy are particularly thorny and beyond her expectations.
China has lowered its 2017 growth target to around 6.5 percent, the lowest in more than two decades, described as ""realistic and in keeping with economic principles.""
China's sociopolitical stability and economic dynamism will continue as slower but more sustainable growth trajectory is backed by consistent efforts to address structural problems.
China, once known as the ""kingdom of bicycles,"" now has more than two million brightly colored new bikes on the road, unlocked by mobile apps and tracked by GPS.
Small wonder that China leads the world in bike-sharing considering the number of consumers, but the current bicycle-mania draws together all the key elements of China's new growth model: Internet technology, a vast market and environmentally friendliness.
China's new pattern is underpinned by its emergence as a manufacturer of the state-of-the-art robots and drones rather than shoddy plastic goods and toys.
With lavish state spending on R&D and human resources, China is moving up the global value chain, with positive forces building up during the transitioning from slower to sustained growth.
China's rising economic might is not at the expense of other countries, but is based on shared prosperity with the rest of the world.
In an anemic global economy, Michael Spence, a Nobel laureate in economics, calls China the ""single most important growth engine of the global economy.""
American auto-maker Tesla is proud of its success in China. Sales have doubled from three years ago when the electric car-maker came to China. China is now the fastest growing and the most important market for Tesla.
Apple plans to open two more R&D centers in Shanghai and Suzhou following its success in Beijing and Shenzhen. ""Look at the talent in China, it is just amazing... We want to broaden our cooperation with China in a deeper way,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook.
Over the next five years, China will import goods worth around 8 trillion U.S. dollars. Inbound and outbound investment should hit 600 billion and 750 billion U.S. dollars.
No matter whether populism, conservatism and protectionism raise their heads or not, China has opened its door to the world and the door will open wider.
While China remains cautious, multilateral agencies have upgraded their projections. The IMF and the OECD have raised their forecasts on China's growth to 6.5 percent for 2017.
Agencies warn however of deeper problems if runaway debt and financial irregularities go unchecked, but China's new strategy leaves plenty of scope to address these risks.",'% robot%'

""The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2013"" was released by the Information Office of the State Council, China's cabinet, in response to ""Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2013"" made public by the U.S. State Department on Thursday.
China's report states that there were serious human rights problems in the U.S in 2013, with the situation deteriorating in many fields. Once again posing as ""the world judge of human rights"", the U.S. government ""made arbitrary attacks and irresponsible remarks"" on almost 200 countries and regions, the report says.
The United States carefully concealed and avoided mentioning its own human rights problems, according to the report.
THE WORLD THROUGH PRISM
The U.S. government spies on its own citizens to a ""massive and unrestrained"" degree, the report says.
The report calls the U.S. PRISM surveillance program, a vast, long-term mechanism for spying on private citizens both at home and abroad, ""a blatant violation of international law"" and says it ""seriously infringes human rights.""
The U.S. intelligence services, by virtue of data provided by Internet and telecom companies -- including Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, and Yahoo -- ""recklessly"" track citizens' private contacts and social activities.
KILLER ROBOTS AND DEAD CONVENTIONS
The report quantifies drone strikes by the U.S. in countries, including Pakistan and Yemen, which have caused heavy civilian casualties. In Pakistan alone, since 2004, the U.S. has carried out 376 drone strikes killing 926 civilians.
The U.S. has not ratified, or participated in, a series of core UN conventions on human rights, such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
>CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT
Solitary confinement is prevalent in the U.S., the report says.
In U.S. prisons, inmates in solitary confinement are enclosed in cramped cells with poor ventilation and little or no natural light, isolated from other prisoners; a situation that takes it toll on inmates' physical and mental health.
About 80,000 U.S. prisoners are in solitary confinement. Some have been held in solitary confinement for over 40 years.

Weighing about a 10th of gram, the little flying machine, dubbed RoboBee, is two centimeters in height. At first glance, it looks just like a mosquito, and a magnifying glass is needed to observe any details.
But the coin-size robot is ready to fly as well as real-life bees. It can flap its two tiny transparent wings at 120 times per second, perch on the underside of a leaf and even ""swim"" under water, when connected with a nearby power source.
RoboBee is the brainchild of a microrobotics lab at Harvard University. Though still in development, Chen Yufeng, a member of the research team, said it holds huge promise.
""In the future, it can replace wild bees to pollinate crops and be used in rescue operations where large equipment and human beings are too big to enter,"" Chen said.
The team started to work on the project in 2008, when the United States saw a huge and rapid decline in the number of wild bees. They obtained $10 million from the US National Science Foundation to finance the research and aim to achieve breakthroughs in autonomous flying, miniaturized chips and other cutting-edge technologies.
After trial and error, they managed to use micro electromechanical processing technology to produce extremely small components that measure only 10 microns.
Chen, who joined the project in 2012 and is studying for his engineering science doctorate at Harvard, is in charge of the research and study of how insects fly?to ensure that RoboBees flap their wings at the same frequency as that of wild bees.
But much work remains to be done to tackle the power problem. These micro aerial vehicles are driven by electricity.
""We have not found batteries that suit RoboBees, because the smallest battery in the world weighs 300 milligrams, about three times the weight of RoboBee,"" said Chen.
""Also, we have yet to figure out how to put image sensors into the tiny body. ""The near-term target is to overcome theses technical difficulties.""
But Chinese consumers and companies are already get excited by the idea. ""Many companies are interested in our product. When the technology matures, we will definitely promote RoboBee in China,"" Chen added.

The nightmare of finding a parking space and then parking your car may soon be a thing of the past, thanks to an automated guided vehicle (AGV) that is soon to hit the market.
Created by Shenzhen-based Yeefung Techonology, the laser-guided machine can park a car in under two minutes, and slip it into even the tightest of spaces.
Nicknamed 'Geta', short for ""Get A Car"", the invention aims to cut down the time it takes to hunt for spaces in increasingly overcrowded cities.

Our company is focusing on three-dimensional parking which requires minimal space. The robot can go everywhere without tracks, it's free and versatile and will reform parking in the future.'
Geta transports a vehicle by picking it up from underneath, and positioning it so that it will fit into a slot. Wu says the system can save 30-40 percent of available space.
""The robot is just like a human being. It uses laser navigation, scanning a reflected signal to pinpoint its location. And like our eyes, it knows where it is by recognising objects around it. The signal is then transmitted to a computer containing a map which then shows the robot where to go.""
The Chinese Mainland is expected to have around 170 million cars by 2017, according to a report by Shenzhen-based consultancy company Forward Intelligence.

Authorities in Dallas, Texas say they believe Thursday's deadly murder of police officers during a protest march in that city has been motivated by racial angst by the country's black community toward police.
Five officers were gunned down and seven more were wounded after a sniper opened fire during a march protesting the recent police killing of a pair of black men by white police officers.
Dallas police say the shooter was extremely upset by the recent killings of two African Americans in Louisiana and Minnesota, and says the shooter specifically wanted to kill white police officers.
""Through our investigation of some of the suspects, it's revealed to us that this was a well-planned, well-sort out, evil tragedy by these suspects. And we won't rest until we bring everyone involved to justice.""
The suspect, now identified as 25-year old former Army Reservist Micha Johnson, reportedly told police during his final stand-off that he was working alone.
He was later killed by a police robot deployed with a bomb after negotiations to end the stand-off failed.
US Attorney General Loretta Lynch says federal officials have been brought in to work with local law enforcement to help investigate the attack.
""Now after the events of this week, Americans across our country are feeling a sense of helplessness of uncertainty and fear. And these feelings are understandable and they're justified. But the answer must not be violence. The answer is never violence.""
Meanwhile, in the State of in Tennessee, one person has been killed and three others wounded after a gunman opened fire on a local highway.
The shooter is also an African-American who targeted police officers, apparently with the same motivation as the gunman in Dallas.
These incidents have once-again rekindled debate about gun control in Washington.
Democrats are calling for debate on tightened gun control laws before lawmakers head home for an eight-week break starting on July 16th.
However, House speaker Paul Ryan says the goal at this point needs to be national reconciliation.
""Every member of this body wants a world in which people feel safe regardless of the color of their skin. And that's not how people are feeling these days. Sometimes we disagree on how to get there. Sometimes we disagree passionately on how to get there. But in having this debate, let's not lose sight of the values that unite us.""

Artificial intelligence (AI), a technology that some fear could destroy humanity, has hit another milestone when Google’s game-playing system AlphaGo defeating a human master at the Chinese game Go, considered the world’s most complex board game. The machine won definitively, taking five out of five matches.
At the World Economic Forum at the Swiss resort of Davos, experts presented the future of artificial intelligence, which is expected to become the cornerstone of a technology-driven industrial revolution.
With AI, robots can understand language, read text, understand emotions and, more importantly, the ""next generation of robots"" may have similar human self-learning abilities, and be able to adapt to the environment. Some even predicted that at advanced stages of artificial intelligence the computer will surpass the human brain.

Two years ago, the famous physicist Stephen Hawking said success in creating AI ""would be the biggest event in human history, (but) unfortunately, it might also be the last,"" unless we know how to avoid this risk.
With machines getting more and more intelligent, humans attach more dependence on machines. Will artificial intelligence be reliable and controllable? Will robots in the workforce cause humans to lose their jobs? Will robots someday control human beings? It is normal that we are concerned about the development of artificial intelligence, but we do not need to be panic.
In fact, the development of artificial intelligence is rapidly advancing, raising expectations of radical changes and greater convenience in people’s lives. For example, technologies such as voice recognitions in smart phones and image identification in electronic payments. And robots work efficiently, tirelessly, and accurately on production lines.

The US Navy is set to unleash an army of 'ghost boats' to scour the coasts for enemy submarines.
They hope to end the growing threat of quiet, diesel powered enemy submarines entering American waters undetected.

The first 132 foot long ship, officially named 'The Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel' will take to the water on April 7th. It could be used for counter-mine missions, reconnaissance and resupply.
Darpa director Dr. Arati Prabhakar and deputy director Dr. Steve Walker revealed the craft.
'Imagine an unmanned surface vessel following all the laws of the sea on its own,' Walker told media, 'and operating with manned surface and unmanned underwater vehicles.'
The robot boats will go to sea for us to three months at a time.
It will be christened in April in Portland, Oregon, and then begin to demonstrate its long-range capabilities over 18 months in cooperation with the Office of Naval Research and the Space and Naval Systems Warfare Command.
'We think the real cost savings will be in operating this vessel at sea compared to how we operate vessels today,' he added.
'It could be used for counter-mine missions, reconnaissance and resupply.'
The project began in 2010, when the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, announced that they were building a 132-foot autonomous boat to track quiet, diesel-powered submarines.
The program was dubbed Anti-submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel, or ACTUV.
In six weeks of tests along a 35-nautical mile stretch of water off of Mississippi earlier this year, testers at engineering company Leidos and Darpa put the ACTUV's systems through 100 different scenarios.
The test boat was able to tail a target boat at 1 kilometer's distance, something military bosses say is a major step forward.
'Picking up the quiet hum of a battery-powered, diesel-electric submarine in busy coastal waters is 'like trying to identify the sound of a single car engine in the din of a major city,' says Rear Admiral Frank Drennan, commander of the Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command.

Xi on Friday visited the People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency and China Central Television, the nation's three leading news providers. (Xinhua/Ju Peng)
BEIJING, Feb. 20 -- President Xi Jinping's inspection tour to three leading news providers on Friday was lauded by reporters, experts and students majoring in journalism.
During a tour to the People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency and China Central Television and at a symposium afterwards, Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, urged the news outlets to follow the Party's leadership and focus on ""positive reporting.""
Journalists supported the president's instruction that the media should work to guide public opinion in the right direction.
Zhang Tie, a senior editorial writer at the People's Daily, told Xinhua that it is the responsibility of all the media run by the CPC to uphold and spread the ""mainstream voice"" of society, especially as society becomes more diversified and opinions vary.
The Party's will and its propositions should be the strongest voice of the times, he said.
According to Xi, the mission of the Party's media work is to provide guidance for the public, serve the country's overall interests, unite the general public, instill confidence and pool strength, tell right from wrong and connect China to the world.
Lu Shaoyang, head of Peking University's School of Journalism &Communication, said guidance does not mean rigid lecturing.
""A firm political stance and fine-tuned professional skills are required for today's media to exercise their duty,"" Lu said.
Ma Xiaorong, a young editor working on the Beijing Youth Daily's WeChat news account, said sensationalism should be avoided when reporting, especially when publishing on social networks.
""The core of news reporting is the people. Positive reporting should also focus on them,"" said Long Min, a reporter with the China News Service southeast China's Fujian Province branch.
Long said that reporters should profile ordinary people and their ""true and touching deeds.""
Positive reporting does not mean avoiding problems, said Tang Ji, a senior reporter with Xinhua's Inner Mongolia branch. Tang covered the wrongful conviction of an 18-year-old man named Huugjilt who was found guilty of rape and murder and executed in 1996. His reports contributed to the conviction being quashed.
As the president noted, public supervision and positive publicity are two compatible functions of media outlets, reporters should be good at finding and exposing problems and pushing society to improve, Tang said.
Reporters were inspired and encouraged by Xi's visit to the media outlets and his acknowledgement of their diligence.
During the media tour, Xi also stressed that journalists should make more in-depth investigative reports in grass-roots communities.
At Xinhua News Agency, Xi talked with a correspondent reporting from a village in Lankao County, Henan Province via Xinhua's remote news reporting command system.
Xi asked the correspondent how local people saw the work style of cadres. Xi said that reporting work styles of grassroots cadres is quite meaningful as the information gathered could help the central authorities to prescribe tailored measures to improve work styles.
Xi also talked with Sun Tiexiang, a Xinhua reporter who recently made interviews in Tayuanzhuang village in Zhengding, Hebei province. Xi visited the village several times while working in Zhengding, and he learned from Sun details about current development in the village.
Xi said, ""local officials must be down-to-earth and keep close ties with ordinary people, and the same is true with reporters.""
At People's Daily, having learnt that many young copy editors work on the night shift, Xi asked whether they have time to make interviews and investigations at grassroots level. He told the newspaper's chiefs to create opportunities for their staff to interview or work in grass-roots communities.
At the symposium, Xinhua reporter Li Keyong, who had made 13 investigative reports since the 18th Party Congress in 2012, mentioned his report of high-end clubs as venues of corruption, Xi commented ""I ordered a thorough investigation into the problem the moment I read this report."" Xi called for more truthful, quality reports based on in-depth investigations.
Xi also inspected the three news providers' new media services.
While visiting the headquarters of the People's Daily, Xi extended Lantern Festival greetings to the public via the paper's new media broadcasting system.
The rate of clicking the audio entry featuring Xi's greeting soared immediately. Some Internet users posted comments, calling it ""a phone call from the General Secretary.""
At Xinhua News Agency, Xi watched presentations of the agency's robot news writing system, Xinhua Silk Road Database, and the agency's services on overseas social media.
Xi also visited an exhibition of the agency's cutting-edge devices for news reporting, including a maritime satellite and a drone, and tried out a hand-held video live broadcasting device.
Xi praised Xinhua's transition to a multimedia news service, saying Xinhua has achieved great progresses.
At the headquarters of CCTV, Xi visited the control room and made a video call to CCTV's Washington-based North America branch, which opened more than four years ago.
Xi asked them to introduce China's social economic development in an objective, truthful and all-around way, tell stories about China well, introduce Chinese culture and bridge friendship.",'% robot%'

Founded in 1966, the company which was once owned by the state, now uses 3D printing for a cleaner, leaner production process.
BETTER BY DESIGN
""3D printing is changing the way foundries operate, revitalizing a process which has basically remained the same in China for 6,000 years,"" said Meng Qingwen, deputy director of the company's 3D printing center.
Traditionally, molten metal is cast into shapes by pouring it into a mold, usually made of sand, and waiting for it to solidify. In the past, to make a complex shape, technicians would break the design down into simple components, make templates of each part individually and then combine the pieces before going on to make the mold. A 3D printer, on the other hand, can make an integrated sand mold of the most complex of shapes directly.
With the new technology, the accuracy of the casting process has increased from 1 mm to 0.2 mm, and the scrap rate has fallen from around 30 percent to less than 5 percent, Meng said.
A diesel engine block, one of the most difficult jobs for any ironworks, now takes only one day, compared with eight days in the past.
ALWAYS INNOVATING
Chairman of KOCEL Peng Fan, said the group brought 3D printing equipment from Germany in 2012 following privatization. KOCEL now uses 3D printing to make parts ranging from a few kilos to 10 tonnes for General Electric, Siemens and other big international players.
One of the main advantages of 3D printing is that the process is much cleaner and less labor-intensive than traditional foundry work. Peng said that some technicians who have been freed from their grimy, sweaty work by the technology have been transferred to traditional workshops for the time-being. They are awaiting training for other positions in the company, like sales and customer service.
""Innovation is not a short-term thing. A company has to continually innovate to keep alive,"" Peng said.
PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES
Apart from foundries, 3D printing has also applications across many industries, including automobiles, electrical appliances, biomedicine and aeronautics.
Lu Bingheng with the Chinese Academy of Sciences teaches 3D-printing at Xi'an Jiaotong University. He claims research on 3D printing is thriving in China.
According to the world intellectual property organization, Chinese applicants account for a quarter of worldwide patents in 3D printing and robotics, making it the only middle-income country approaching the level of technological innovation of developed countries.
Lu said 3D printing, vital to research and development of high-end items, will greatly help enterprises.
A NEW ENGINE
Affected by the global economic downturn, many manufacturers have problems like overcapacity, pollution and low-end products which 3D printing can help.
Research by the McKinsey Global Institute found China had performed well in customer-focused and efficiency-driven innovation, which include consumer electronics, Internet services and flexible manufacturing.
According to McKinsey, new opportunities could contribute 1 to 2.2 trillion U.S. dollars a year to the Chinese economy, or 24 percent of total GDP growth by 2025, if transformation of manufacturing continues, particularly digitization.
However, He Jun of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences institute of industrial economics, believes 3D printing is only a small factor in China's giant manufacturing industry, and it is too early to say if China is heading toward an ""intelligent manufacturing stage.""
""3D printing is hard to apply on a large scale considering it prints irregular, customized products with very high cost,"" he said.
While He and others are cautious about 3D printing's prospects, others argue that the technology will definitely rock global manufacturing someday soon.
Lin is team leader at Tsinghua University's laboratory of biofabrication and rapid prototyping technology, which studies the 3D printing's application in biomanufacturing. He said that unlike traditional manufacturing that is subtractive, 3D printing is additive.
""Traditional manufacturing is like digging a cave house, when you need to remove the unwanted earth, while 3D printing is like building a house, or whatever you want with bricks, laid piece by piece."" he explained.
""The technology may not change current manufacturing instantly, but for sure it will have a profound impact,"" he said.
The debate is expected to be brought to the annual two sessions of lawmakers and political advisors early in March, which will set specific plans for the country's manufacturing aspirations by 2025.",'% robot%'

That's according to physicist, Phillip Lubin, who recently outlined how a probe could reach the red planet in just three days.
Now, Lubin says that time could be reduced to just 30 minutes by using extremely powerful lasers to propel a wafer-thin unmanned spacecraft.
Physicists in California are working on spacecraft that could let humans reach the nearest stars in our solar system - a challenge that is not possible with current propulsion technology. The answer could lie in what's known as photonic propulsion, a technique that uses light from lasers to produce thrust (illustrated)
The UC Santa Barbara physics professor first unveiled his 'directed energy propulsion' concept at a Nasa Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) symposium last October.
He's now followed up his comments with a detailed 52-page paper in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society.
He claims that by firing a laser at a spacecraft, it would have the ability to achieve frictionless acceleration in space.
That would allow it to reach a more than a quarter speed of light in just minutes.
'As an example, on the eventual upper end, a full-scale (50-70 GW) DE-STAR 4 - Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and Exploration - will propel a wafer scale spacecraft with a one meter sail to about 26 percent the speed of light in about 10 minutes,' Lubin says.
'[It would] reach Mars (1 AU) in 30 minutes, pass Voyager 1 in less than 3 days, pass 1,000 AU in 12 days and reach Alpha Centauri in about 15 years.'
This means that the craft would be travelling at roughly 174.3 million miles per hour.
There are some major flaws in Lubin's plan, such as how such a fast-moving probe would slow down when it reached Mars.
The difficulty of encountering space junk is a major problem. But according to Lubin, the accumulation of interplanetary dust won't impact its speed.
Digital Trends points out that another problem may be the impact of 'time dilation'.
All spacecraft operate by firing propellant in the opposite direction to the way they want to travel. Traditionally this propellant is fuel. Photonic propulsion uses an array of lasers instead, which means no fuel needs to be carried on the spacecraft. This enables it to accelerate for longer and reach higher speeds (illustrated)
The effect was shown in Christopher Nolan's 2014 science film Interstellar, in which a group of astronauts fly into the center of a supernatural wormhole.
As they move farther into the universe, the time they experience slows down.
The same thing could happen to a crew if they were able to reach Mars in 30 minutes. While it would appear as if they only spent 30 minutes getting to the red planet, in reality decades would pass.
However, Lubin points out that manned probes are still a distant dream, and his proposal centres on a tiny unmanned craft.
Whereas things like warp drives remain a fantasy, Lubin says this technology is available right now, and it may be scalable.
'This technology is not science fiction,' Lubin says. 'Things have changed.'
Professor Phillip Lubin and his team from the University of California Santa Barbara are currently working on the Directed Energy Interstellar Precursors (Deep-In) programme.
One problem with the concept may be the impact of 'time dilation'. The effect was shown in Christopher Nolan's 2014 science film Interstellar, in which a group of astronauts fly into the center of a supernatural wormhole. As they move farther into the universe, the time they experience slows down.
The programme aims to create probes capable of reaching relativistic speeds and travelling to the nearest stars.
'We know how to get to relativistic speeds in the lab, we do it all the time,' said Lubin at Nasa's National Innovative Advanced Concepts (Niac) symposium.
'When we go to the macroscopic level, things like aircraft, cars, spacecraft, were pathetically slow.'
He claims with laser technology 'we could propel a 100kg aircraft to Mars in a few days. In comparison it would take a shuttle roughly a month to get there,' the researchers said.
Professor Lubin was making reference to Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) shuttle.
By comparison, 'the SLS when it takes off will have a power of between 50 and 100GW to get into orbit,' said Professor Lubin.
When it's built in 2018, it will launch astronauts in the agency's Orion spacecraft on missions to an asteroid placed in lunar orbit, and eventually to Mars.
'It turns out to get to relativistic speeds, just using different technology, it would take the same amount of energy for roughly the same amount of time,' continued Professor Lubin.
Lubin, however, stressed that his current work is focused on small-scale probes.
'We are not proposing systems to send humans to interstellar distances,' he told DailyMail.com about the current project.
'Humans are extremely fragile and require a lot of support. Robotic missions are much better suited for interstellar exploration in the future.'",'% robot%'

Disruptive labor market changes will result in a loss of more than 5.1 million jobs from 2015 to 2020, according to a latest report by World Economic Forum (WEF).
The Fourth Industrial Revolution, which includes developments in previously disjointed fields such as artificial intelligence and machine-learning, robotics, nanotechnology, 3-D printing, and genetics and biotechnology, will cause widespread disruption not only to business models but also to labor markets over the next five years, according to the report, The Future of Jobs, published Monday by the WEF.
This trend will lead to a loss of more than 5 million jobs in 15 major developed and emerging economies, said the report.
The report predicts that in the next five years there will be a total loss of 7.1 million jobs—two thirds of which are concentrated in routine white collar office functions, such as office and administrative roles—and a total gain of 2 million jobs, in computer and mathematical and Architecture and Engineering related fields.

And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.
According to a latest international survey, four out of 10 young people around the world worry that robot will replace them in the future workforce due to rapid development of technology.
Commissioned by Indian business and software services firm Infosys, the study surveyed around 1,000 16-to 25-year-olds in Australia, Brazil, Britain, China, France, Germany, India and the United States, as well as South Africa, where a smaller sample of 700 was polled. Young people in developed economies are more worried about their future jobs.
Nearly 80 per cent of interviewees think that it is a must to keep learning in order to gain competitiveness ahead of rapid development of technology.
Globally, while almost two-thirds of those queried said they felt positive about their job prospects, those in developing economies were far more optimistic than their peers in developed markets. In India, 60 per cent said they think they have the skills needed for their careers, just a quarter were similarly optimistic in France, the poll found.
The survey shows that nearly 50 per cent of interviewees from developed markets said that the education they received is not suitable for jobs.
According to Infosys Chief Executive Vishal Sikka, technologies have evolved far faster than what was thought possible even 10 years ago, while the educational system remains wedded to practices initially designed for agrarian societies 300 years ago.

China has become the biggest consumer of industrial robots, but domestically produced robots account for only 30 percent of market shares. Key parts rely on imports, which take up over 70 percent of production cost.
Industrial robots have recently been dominating the robot industry. Wang Tianran, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and an automation researcher, thinks that the demand for robots in China is seeing a rapid increase due to the rising cost of human labor. The use of robots can not only increase production efficiency but can also save on cost.
China became the biggest global robot market in 2013, and its sales volume accounts for a quarter of the global sales volume. Qu Daokui, President of China Robot Industry Alliance, said that China has over 30 big robot development areas and industrial parks. Hundreds of listed enterprises focus on robots and thousands more are robot-related.
Globally, robot popularity is measured by robot ownership per every 10,000 workers. Currently in China, there are 23 robots per 10,000 workers. That number exceeds 300 in Japan and South Korea.
China is in the process of working out its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for the robot industry. Made in China 2025 has listed robots and advanced numerically controlled machines in the top ten important fields that need a breakthrough.
As for the heavy dependence on foreign materials, development of artificial intelligence and internet technology will be of great use to smart robots, according to Wang.

Nearly half of all jobs in Japan could be stolen by robots or accomplished using artificial intelligence in the next ten to twenty years, according to recent speculation by Japanese and British researchers.
Will half the population face unemployment?
Japanese think tank Nomura Research Institute and Oxford University conducted a joint survey, which found that that computer applications could potentially impact 601 different occupations in Japan. A total of 42.8 million employees are engaged in these 601 occupations.
Researchers believe that if 66 percent of a job can be carried out using artificial intelligence or robots, it can be regarded as replaceable. The survey shows that 49 percent of Japanese employees could be replaced by computers.

Similar studies previously conducted by Oxford University show that 47 percent of all positions in the U.S. and 35 percent of positions in Britain could be done by robots.
Which jobs are likely to be stolen?
Occupations such as general clerk, taxi driver, cashier, security guard, building cleaner and hotel room attendant are easy for computers to take over because they do not require special knowledge or skills, researchers predicted.

On the other hand, occupations that need interpersonal exchange, including doctor, teacher, academic researcher, tour guide and beautician have a lower possibility of being taken over by robots.
However, Nomura Research Institute noted that the study did not consider the balance between supply and demand of labor forces involved in these occupations.

Due to a shortage of labor forces, Japan is a global leader in robot research and application. More than 250,000 industrial robots are used in Japanese enterprises. Japan ranks first in the world for its use of robots in industry.
Japan also boasts the world's first robot hotel and has developed a series of robots used for disaster relief. In addition, it has an emotion-displaying robot that has served as a film actress.

It's the kind of robot you would often see hiding behind safety barriers at factories.
No sooner had the master pushed his right hand against the robot than the latter sprung into action, circled around and smoothly pushed him back in one fluid motion.

One Chinese restaurant, however, has ripped up the rule book, and in doing so might just change the way people eat out forever.
While many restaurants go to great lengths to create a certain ambience or plate up food so that it looks more like art than a meal, noodle restaurant Renrenxiang, in Beijing's downtown Guomao, has made a name for itself by doing something all-together different.
The first thing customers notice when they arrive at the noodle restaurant is that there is something missing. While it is customary that waiters greet customers at the door and show them to a table, there is no one to do this at Renrenxiang. In fact, there are no waitstaff at all.
In place of hosts, waiters and cashiers, there is something a lot more 21st century -- a phone app. The only place with human activity is the kitchen where chefs turn digital orders into dishes.
The restaurant's app runs on WeChat, China's most popular online messaging app.
Diners order and pay with the app, wait for their number to be called and then take their own food from the counter. After eating, they deposit their crockery on a cleaning table.
Moreover, customers don't even have to be in the restaurant to order. One frequent diner, Miss Wang, who works nearby, says she orders while still in the office and takes a leisurely stroll down to the restaurant. By the time she arrives, her food is ready and she can enjoy it immediately. ""It's very convenient,"" she says.
Liu Zheng, CEO of Renrenxiang, is proud and optimistic about this system as it reflects the popular online-to-offline service trend gripping China currently. It makes his business more efficient and saves him money as he has less wages to fork out for.
""Opening a restaurant has a huge outlay: Rent, decoration, salaries, the list goes on. Thanks to the rise of the app we can cut out unnecessary expenditure, simplify management and focus more on taste and quality,"" Liu says.
The app also collects customer-related data -- what dish is the most poplar, and what age groups visit more frequently. Renrenxiang uses the data to improve its marketing strategy.
Liu says he plans to further automate the process to achieve the ""Four No's"" -- no waitstaff, no cashier, no purchaser and no chef.
Renrenxiang is not the first restaurant to offer waiterless service. As early as in 2007, a restaurant in Nuremberg, Germany, began to offer fully automated order and table services. There are also places in Japan and the United States.
Though a waiterless restaurant is still a novelty, automation is already part of many restaurants. More and more now allow customers to make reservations online, order through touch-screens and pay by mobile payment services.
Using robots, instead of humans, to cook, serve and clean has also become more common in China this year.
But will these developments lead to a waiterless future?
No one can deny the change that technology has had on people's lives, and it was only really a matter of time before automation really took off in the restaurant industry.
""The catering industry involves lots of human activity but that doesn't mean restaurants must have waitstaff. The core of the industry is service and most of this can actually be done by machines and programmed systems. Reducing the roles of waiters and cashiers is not the same as reducing the standard of service, instead it means quicker service and reduced costs,"" says Jiang Xiaoyu, an employee at Renrenxiang.
There are, however, those who are loath to lose the ""traditional"" style of dining and are steadfast in their belief that it cannot be replaced.
""Waiterless service works well for fast food, as the food prep is standardized and it's relatively easy to make the switch to automation. In finer restaurants, however, the cooking process is complicated and the role of waiters is more than just serving food,"" says Wang Jianhao, the owner of Xiexilan, a Sri Lankan restaurant in Beijing's bustling Sanlitun area.
""The catering industry is very diverse -- just like the needs of many customers, so various types of service need to be available,"" Wang says.
""Dining at a restaurant isn't just about eating,"" says a new customer surnamed Zhang at Renrenxiang. ""The overall ambiance, the joy of browsing the menu and selecting dishes, and the satisfaction of being well served are also important. Technology does make life a lot more convenient, but it can't replace human interaction.""",'% robot%'

An algorithm called AlphaGo has beaten one of the 3,000-year-old game's best players called Fan Hui in a recent tournament set up by Google.
The game, which was first played in China and is far harder than chess, had been regarded as an outstanding 'grand challenge' for Artificial Intelligence - until now.
A computer programme has beaten one of the best players at what's described as 'the most complex game ever devised by man'. An illustration showing a half a traditional Go board and half showing computer-calculated moves is pictured above.
The result of the tournament, which the machine won 5-0, provides hope robots could perform as well as humans in areas of as complex as disease analysis, but it may worry some who fear we may be outsmarted by the machines we create.
The computer is now set to take on the world's best Go player with a cool $1 million (£701,607) prize pot up for grabs.
If the computer wins, its developer Demis Hassabis, boss of Google-owned DeepMind said it will donate the winnings to charity.
In the game, two players take turns to place black or white stones on a square grid, with the goal being to dominate the board by surrounding the opponent's pieces.
Once placed, the stones can't be moved unless they are surrounded and captured by the other person's pieces.
It's been estimated there are 10 to the power of 700 possible ways a Go game can be played - more than the number of atoms in the universe.
By contrast, chess - a game at which Artificial Intelligence (AI) can already play at grandmaster level and famously defeated world champion Gary Kasparov 20 years ago - has about 10 to the power of 60 possible scenarios.
Until now, the most successful computer Go programmes have played at the level of human amateurs and have not been able to defeat a professional player.
But the champion program called AlphaGo, uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy networks' to select moves.
The 'deep neural' networks are trained through a combination of 'supervised learning' from human expert games and 'reinforcement learning' from games it plays against itself.
AlphaGo was developed by Google's DeepMind and signifies a major step forward in one of the great challenges in the development of AI - that of game-playing.
The computer achieved a 99.8 per cent winning rate against other Go programmes and defeated the three-times European Go champion and Chinese professional Fan Hui in a tournament by a clean sweep of five games to nil.
Now the machine has beaten Fan Hui (pictured left) it will face the top human player - Lee Sedol (right) of South Korea – at a meeting in Seoul in March, with the winner to be awarded $1 million (£701,607)
Toby Manning, treasurer of the British Go Association who was the referee, said: 'The games were played under full tournament conditions and there was no disadvantage to Fan Hui in playing a machine not a man.
'Google DeepMind are to be congratulated in developing this impressive piece of software.'
This is the first time a computer programme has defeated a professional player in the full-sized game of Go with no handicap.
This feat was believed to be a decade away.
The computer will take on the top human player - Lee Sedol, of South Korea – at a meeting in Seoul in March, with the inner to be awarded $1 milion.
Mr Sedol said: 'I have heard that Google DeepMind's AI is surprisingly strong and getting stronger, but I am confident that I can win at least this time.'
In the game, two players take turns to place black or white stones on a square grid, with the goal being to dominate the board by surrounding the opponent's pieces.
The program took on reigning three-time European Go champion Fan Hui at Google's London office. In a closed-doors match last October, AlphaGo won by five games to zero (the end positions are shown)
President of the British Go Association Jon Diamond said: 'Following the Chess match between Gary Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue in 1996 the goal of some Artificial Intelligence researchers to beat the top human Go players was an outstanding challenge - perhaps the most difficult one in the realm of games.
'It's always been acknowledged the higher branching factor in Go compared to Chess and the higher number of moves in a game made programming Go an order of magnitude more difficult.
'On reviewing the games against Fan Hui I was very impressed by AlphaGo's strength and actually found it difficult to decide which side was the computer, when I had no prior knowledge.
'Before this match the best computer programs were not as good as the top amateur players and I was still expecting that it would be at least five to 10 years before a program would be able to beat the top human players.",'% robot%'

CANBERRA, Sept. 26 -- Australian scientists developed a prototype autonomous vehicle, ""Outback Rover,"" to help scientists to improve the accuracy of Earth observation satellites that provide valuable data to Australia's mining and agricultural industries, according to a latest research statement from CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, on Thursday.
Just as the Mars Rover Curiosity is gathering information about our neighboring planet, CSIRO's affectionately nicknamed 'Outback Rover' is helping to calibrate satellites that provide clues to Earth's soil condition, mineralogy and vegetation.
According to the statement, accompanied by researchers from Japan, China, Israel and France, CSIRO scientists recently took the rover prototype on a mission to Lake Lefroy -- a huge salt lake in remote Western Australia -- to see if they can automate the satellite calibration process.
This is where information gathered by satellites is matched against measurements taken on-ground and compared for accuracy, said Professor Arnold Dekker, Director of Earth Observation and Informatics at CSIRO.
""Satellite data is used for resource exploration, environmental monitoring and agricultural management such as soil mapping. So it must be regularly cross-checked to ensure that observations are accurate,"" Dekker explained.
""This process is called vicarious calibration and is undertaken by ground crews who walk in grids or transects, taking measurements with hand-held devices known as spectrometers, as satellites travel overhead,"" Dekker added.
CSIRO's science leader for robotics Dr. Alberto Elfes said this could be about to change. He hopes the rover will be able to collect calibration data autonomously and send it wirelessly back to researchers.
""The ultimate goal is to have the rover operate alone, with scientists from over the world able to retrieve data from it or control it remotely in real-time,"" Dr. Elfes said. ""For example, scientists could tell the robot to turn left or right, follow a sensor signature that is interesting or do a more detailed analysis in a particular area.""
""Once we know we have acquired accurate data from satellites, it can be used for a range of applications. It can show us where to explore for mineral deposits and even allow us to monitor soils, which can provide great benefit to our farmers,"" Dr. Elfes said.
In addition, as well as ensuring the accuracy of the current suite of space traveling cameras and sensors, the information collected by the rover could also be used for the next-generation of satellites that will use high-resolution 'hyperspectral' images.
Owing to its sheer size, Australia is one of the world's biggest consumers of Earth observation data however it doesn't own any remote sensing satellites.
""This is why international collaborations like this are vitally important, and have led to major achievements such as our world- first continental scale mineral maps, derived from the Japanese ASTER sensor on board the NASA TERRA satellite,"" Professor Dekker said.

Firstly, the use of robots will extend from ""high end"" industries such as automobile and equipment manufacturing to conventional industries such as textile and general manufacturing. Simple and repetitive processes will be done by robots, which can save on labor costs and improve production efficiency.
Secondly, the market for service robots will expand greatly. In 2014, less than 1 percent of robot users were service enterprises, which means a great potential. Now, service robots have appeared in some banks and restaurants. In the future, more robots will play roles such as cleaners and nurses. The size of the market for service robots is considerable.

The toy-sized robots can coordinate with each other on the battlefield.
The scout, or reconnaissance robot, is responsible for field detection through camera or sensor, according to Wu Yanpeng, an engineer at HIT Robot Group in northeast China's Harbin city, developer of the robots.
When the scout detects or senses something suspicious such as poisonous gas, dangerous chemicals and explosives, the information is transmitted back to headquarters for further analysis, said Wu.
Based on the analysis of the type of explosives and need for evacuation, the small EOD robot and the armed attack robot will start their missions.
The small EOD robot is tasked with moving and defusing the bomb. If the complexity is beyond the robot's capabilities, then bomb experts in the office have to come up with a proper solution, said Wu.
The small EOD robot, which weighs about 12 kg, is specially designed for soldiers working alone. Made of aluminum alloy and industrial plastic, the robot can be carried on the back of a single soldier.
The armed attack robot, or the attacker, is designed to carry minor-caliber weapons, recoilless rifles and grenade launchers. With a sighting telescope, a trigger and a safe installed, the attacker can hit its target from a long distance.
The set of three robots is priced at 1.5 million yuan (about 230, 000 U.S. dollars), according to Chen Deqiang, sales manager of HIT Robot Group. Wu said the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau is among the buyers who have shelled out for the robots.
Apart from anti-terror operations, they can also be applied in fire fighting, public security, forestry and agriculture, said Chen.
Guo Shengkun, head of the national anti-terrorism leading group and China's police chief, urged heightened alert and prevention of terrorism at a televised meeting following the deadly Paris attacks.",'% robot%'

Humanoid robots that can perform feats such as gauging a human's mood highlight the World Robot Exhibition at the World Robot Conference 2015 in Beijing on Tuesday.
Experts, International organizations and more than 120 companies in the field have gathered at the conference.
Humanoid robot Xiaoluo, made by domestic company Tami Intelligence, is famous for interacting with people and has even hosted galas on television.
Liu Boyi, the product manager of Tami Intelligence, introduces their robot.
""The robot has plenty of facial expressions, and the screen installed in its eyes can give people a good feeling of interaction. And (it can) follow the human body, which means it can imitate (your gestures when) when you are in front of it. Most importantly, it can recognize if you are a man or a woman, and tell your age and whether you are happy, and the degree of your happiness. It knows all of that.""
Even though many robotics companies are seeking ways to reduce human labour, conference visitor Miao Jun doubts that will ever happen.
""Robots can never fully replace human labour. For example, from the old days, when each worker had a single sewing machine in textile mills, to nowadays when one worker has ten sewing machines, only people can control these machines. Artificial intelligence has its limitations, and cannot take the place of human beings, but rather, it can reduce people's repetitive labour.""
Android Genminoid F is created by Hiroshi Ishiguro Laboratory at Osaka University.
The life-like female robot has stolen the spotlight of the exhibition.
Visitors crowd around to take photographs and talk to her.
Assistant Professor of Osaka University Kohei Ogawa is one of the robot's creators.
He says despite the robot's physical features and capabilities, it's still a work in progress.
""Our final goal is creating some AI system out of showing intelligence by using this robot. But still it's difficult, for example, voice recognition system doesn't work, especially in this kind of noisy environment. So that's why practically this robot is useful for tele-operated medium. But in the future, of course we are gonna create some perfect AI system by using this robot. To know the humans, to create the humans, the both.""
The exhibition also shows trends for future technological development, making it a good place for investors to go for business opportunities.
Gao Runlong is an investor in the tech sector. The 37-year-old holds high expectations for Chinese robots and the future of the industry.
""Robotics will be more popular gradually, then robots can largely take place of human labour in families and business. So in the future world, there will be great changes in terms of intelligent manufacturing and robots. Let's wait and see.""

The World Robot Conference 2015 is set to close in Beijing on this Wednesday.
During the three-day expo, China has been encouraging overseas robotics companies to share technologies with China-based vendors.
Meantime, China is attempting to develop the market share of made-in-China robots, with a goal of over 30 percent of the global market share by 2030.
The aim is to use robots to improve efficiency in manufacturing sectors ranging from automobiles to textiles.
China became the world's largest robotics market last year by the number of products in use.
At the same time, the aging population and the increasing income of Chinese families are set to boost sales of service robots.
Robots can conduct such tasks as cooking, monitoring blood pressure and helping senior citizens.

Committee's draft of plan almost ready for government review
China is close to complete a five-year development plan for home-made robots industry, multiple sources said on Friday. The ambitious plan aims to more than double the market share of made-in-China robots to 50 percent by 2020.
An expert who participated in drawing up the plan said a committee advising on the robotics element of the country's ""Made in China 2025"" strategy is ""almost ready"" to submit its draft to the central government for final approval.
""It will be announced in early 2016, if not next month,"" said the expert, who asked to remain anonymous.
The government committee's members come from across a range of key industrial sectors covered by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
""Made in China 2025"" is an attempt to transform the country from being the biggest manufacturing power into one of the world's strongest modern technology-driven economies.
Guangdong-based newspaper 21st Century Business Herald also reported the robot plan will be implemented by year end, citing another unnamed source.
A committee document supplied to China Daily revealed the country will look specifically at making ""breakthroughs"" in key technologies, such as decelerator and controlling systems.
The document also mapped out a longer 10-year growth route for the robotics industry, by which time China is expected to have more than 70 percent of the global market.
""Domestic robot makers will have a bigger say in the market in coming years as they advance in industrial know-how and in developing and manufacturing service robots,"" the document said.
Luo Jun, executive president of the International Robotics and Intelligent Equipment Industry Alliance, however said domestic players currently took about 20 percent of the market share, which makes the 50 percent target ""very difficult to accomplish"". Luo said Chinese players currently have around a fifth of the global market, making the 50 percent target ""very difficult to accomplish"".
Chinese vendors are already making strong inroads into lower-end markets, largely based on price. But it's the global vendors, including Switzerland-based multinational ABB Ltd, that still have a firm hold on higher-end manufacturing, which demand greater levels of accuracy and sophistication of their robots, especially in areas such as welding or delicate assembly.
China's car-making industry, the biggest domestic market for robots, still depends on imported devices for most assembly work.
According to the MIIT document, capturing a bigger local market remains the priority for domestic firms if they are to compete effectively with foreign rivals.
But as manufacturers continue to replace their sometimes aging systems with state-of-the-art robotics, the ministry estimates that by 2020 at least 150,000 will be added to Chinese factories, bringing the total industrial robot population nationally to 1.8 million by 2025.",'% robot%'

Humans will be very different creatures 1,000 years from now.
Climate change, artificial intelligence and genetic mutations are all set to transform our bodies in drastic ways, according to a recent video.
We could for instance, develop red eyes as our DNA mutates, and have darker skin as an evolutionary response to global warming.
'In the future nanobots - or tiny robots - will be suddenly integrated into our own bodies, enhancing our abilities,' it says
'No longer will we be limited by own own physiology, but truly become a mixture of biology and machine on the inside.'
Meanwhile, designer babies will cause future generations to grow into intelligent, attractive and physically people.
'But while that will make us better smarter, stronger and better looking, such genetic similarity, or lack of human diversity, leaves room for a single new disease of the future, to wipe out the entire human race.'
As global warming takes hold, humans will also be skinnier and taller, it predicts, as this body shape is better able to dissipate heat.
Our faces may also change dramatically, according to Dr Alan Kwan, who holds a PhD in computational genomics from Washington University in St Louis.
Genetic mutations may cause our eyes to turn red and give us superhuman abilities, the video claims
Dr Kawn has created a stunning series of images which display one possible evolution for the human race over the next 100,000 years.
Dr Kwan believes that key to our future evolution will be man ‘wresting control’ of the human form from natural evolution and adapting human biology to suit our needs.
As genetic engineering becomes the norm, ‘the fate of the human face will be increasingly determined by human tastes’ writes Dr Kwan, while foreheads will continue to expand as our brains continue to grow larger.
As man achieves total mastery over genetics, the human face will become heavily biased towards features that humans find fundamentally appealing: strong, regal lines, straight nose, intense eyes, and placement of facial features that adhere to the golden ratio and left/right perfect symmetry.
As genetic engineering becomes the norm, the fate of the human face will be increasingly determined by human tastes writes Dr Kwan, while foreheads will continue to expand as our brains continue to grow larger.Dr Kwan believes eyes will grow 'unnervingly large' as the human race colonizes the solar system

As one of the eight great technologies that Britain has invested in and supported, robotics has close relations with health care and people's daily lives.
""I think within five to ten years, we will have systems that are able to assist and help people to stay at home longer and actually give them happier lives,"" said Geoff Pegman.

The two ramen robots have a clear division of labor, working in tandem to pour noodles into the pot, boil them, add soup and ingredients, and serving. They are capable of finishing the whole process in an average of 90 seconds.
The robots can manage the boiling time precisely and control the amount of ingredients, keeping the taste and temperature consistent.
Apart from seafood and fried fish ramen, the robots can be upgraded to serve ramen with beef and braised pork in brown sauce to cater to Chinese customers' tastes.
In 2015 alone, dozens of restaurants featuring robots emerged in large and medium-sized cities across China. In addition to attracting curious customers, they have proven to increase efficiency and lower the operating costs.
As the first restaurant providing robot service in Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan Province, Moli Robot restaurant employed one greeting robot, two noodle-slicing robots and four serving robots when it opened in July.
Employing the robots is actually cost-effective, Moli's manager, surnamed Zhou, said.
Each robot cost around 48,000 yuan (about 7,400 U.S. dollars) -- about the same as the annual salary for one server. This means the restaurant can recover costs within a year, Zhou said.
""Normally one robot can work three to five years, so they are definitely much cheaper than employing waiters and waitresses,"" he said.
Burdened by rising salaries and a labor shortage, restaurant managers have had difficulties finding staff in recent years. Zhou said the serving robots have come at the right time as they are capable of addressing both issues.
Based on a report published by China's recruiting website Ganji, nearly 70 percent of enterprises in China are in shortage of labor this year, with enterprises lacking 14 employees on average. While in the service industry, each enterprise short of 16 employees.
The robots don't ask for leave and they won't get ill. Charge them for 6 hours during the night and they can work around 10 hours a day, said a woman surnamed Wu, who manages Shenghuayuan in east China's Hangzhou City.
Since customers are pleased to take photos and share them on social media after being served by the robots, ""the robots become natural advertisements,"" said Wu.
China will focus on service robots and intelligent robots in the coming five years, according to Xin Guobin, vice minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology at a meeting earlier this month.
In the coming 30 years, China will be the largest market of robots and intelligent equipment. By 2020, the number of robots in China will exceed 400,000, estimated by Luo Jun, secretary of the International Robotics and Intelligent Equipment Industry Alliance.",'% robot%'

After three failed attempts, it marks a breakthrough not only for SpaceX but also for Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX.

In January and April, the company tried twice but all their efforts thwarted for the failed system and engine malfunction. What’s worse, the rocket ended in an explosion during the company’s third attempt.
That’s why when the rocket landed, Elon Musk tweeted that “11 satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!”
Even NASA and Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, sent their congratulations.
Everyone is told that the success signifies an upcoming cheaper era for space travel. Traditionally, rockets are discarded after they detach from the space shuttle. Now, a private company makes them reusable.
And that’s not the first time that a rocket was guided to land safely on the earth. Blue Origin, another private company headed by Jeff Bezos made a safe rocket landing on November 24 this year after it travelled 62 miles above Earth.
These successful experiments, although from different companies, may bring more significant changes than people can ever imagine. And it will definitely encourage other private companies to try more and encourage more companies to join the club to explore the outer space.
Well, the club now has already had some front- runners: Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, who established his own space tourism company —— Virgin Galactic, a spaceline for Earth with the goal of democratizing access to space for the benefit of life on earth; Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, who designed SpaceShipOne, the first experimental air-launched rocket-powered aircraft with suborbital flight capability that uses a hybrid rocket motor; and Google Lunar X Prize incentivizes space entrepreneurs to land a privately funded robot on the moon.
Life is not about ongoing trivial, but about poem and travel. Maybe only when people really care about remote things, could they change where they live.
Elon Musk’s goal is to “colonize” Mars by creating two “suns” over the Mars to warm up the red planet and turn any frozen carbon dioxide into gas. He even mentioned that SpaceX is currently working on plans for their Mars transit vehicle during an interview this year.
Now the Mars is not a totem for those explorers. It could be a new habitat for human beings. Imagine in 20 years, When SpaceX build a home on Mars, are you willing to sell everything and buy a one-way ticket from Elon Musk to be the first habitants there?

Jointly developed by scientists from Hangzhou Dianzi University and Zhejiang University in east China's Zhejiang Province, the new chip, named ""Darwin,"" was revealed earlier this week after more than a year of research.
""It can perform intelligent computer tasks by simulating a human brain's neural networks, in which neurons connect with one another via synapses,"" said Dr. Ma De from Hangzhou Dianzi University.
The black plastic piece is smaller than a dime, but is equipped with 2,048 neurons and four million synapses, two of the fundamental units that make up the human brain.
With the new chip, a computer can do more while using less electricity. ""It can process 'fuzzy information' that conventional computer chips fail to process,"" said Shen Juncheng, a scientist from Zhejiang University.
For example, it can recognize numbers written by different people, distinguish among different images, and move objects on screen by receiving a user's brain signals.
The brain-like chip is expected to be used in robotics, intelligent hardware systems and brain-computer interfaces, but its development is still in the preliminary stage, according to Ma.
TrueNorth, an advanced brain-like chip developed by IBM, is on the United States' technology embargo list to China, so Chinese scientists had to start their research from scratch.
The development of Darwin marked a significant breakthrough in brain-inspired computing research in China. The research findings were published in the online English edition of ""Science China: Information Sciences,"" an academic journal.",'% robot%'

Lunar rover Yutu, or Jade Rabbit, roused from its third lunar night slumber on Friday, stretching its wings in the sun after its dormancy in temperatures as low as minus 180 degrees Celsius. People on Earth were relieved by its greeting on an online diary posted under the name ""Lunar Rover Yutu.""
""Don't poke me... I'm already up!"" the six-foot robot told the 600,000-strong followers of the blog, who had been crossing their fingers that the rover would survive its second sleep since a mechanical abnormality was spotted at the end of January.
""Any carrot pie for me?"" Yutu asked upon waking on March 14, a day celebrated by mathematics enthusiasts as ""Pi Day"" in honor of the famous ratio's first few digits, 3.14.
Named after the pet rabbit of moon goddess Chang'e from Chinese legend, the lunar rover largely stayed out of the spotlight until news came that a mechanical control abnormality prior to its second dormancy might cripple the robot.
The news meant that Yutu might never wake up when dawn greeted the moon.
The vehicle had been on the moon for 42 days and traveled for more than 100 meters when its second lunar night, equivalent to a fortnight on Earth, fell on Jan. 25. The mechanical errors posed a survival challenge for the country's first moon rover.
Online communities worried about the fate of Jade Rabbit after a post on Sina Weibo, China's answer to Twitter, said, ""Ah, I'm broken,"" telling people that the rover ""might not make it through this moon night.""
""I thought I could hop around here for three months, but if this trip ends prematurely, I'm not afraid,"" said the blog entry.
The unverified Weibo account ""Lunar Rover Yutu"" began keeping a diary for the robot, written in a rabbit's voice, on Dec. 1, one day before the rover's launch.
The farewell message attracted broader attention to both the rover and the blog account.
Its last words, ""Good night, Earth. Good night, humanity,"" prompted both tears and prayers from ""rabbit fans.""
Blessings flooded social media and the blogosphere, with fans saying, ""Wake up, rabbit!"" and ""Come on, bunny! We all stand by you!""
The Weibo account remained silent for two weeks, with its followers prepared for the worst until Feb. 13, when the robot announced its survival by asking, ""Hi, anyone there?""
The post went viral with over 119,000 reposts, 72,000 comments and 85,000 likes. Even overseas netizens and media joined to hail Yutu's survival.
""YIPPEEE!!! Nice!! I read the headline and I cheered so loud, I fear my neighbors might think I'm nuts... lol! That's so cool for China, the mission and space exploration in general!"" wrote user Jeffrey Boerst in the comments section of an article from Universe Today, a space and astronomy news site.
The report began with the two-word lead ""Yutu Lives!"" and referred to the rover as ""the little 'rabbit' beloved worldwide.""
TO THE MOON
The bunny embarked on its adventure on Dec. 2, when an enhanced Long March-3B rocket carrying its mothership, the Chang'e-3 lunar probe, blasted off at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China.
Before the launch, the ""Yutu Lunar Rover"" blog reported that the rabbit was ""a bit nervous.""
A major challenge for the 140-kg robot was the 300-degree Celsius temperature fluctuation on the moon. When the sun sets, the solar-powered rover must hibernate and survive the night with a radioisotope heat source.
After traveling for 12 days, Chang'e-3 touched down on the moon's Sinus Iridum, or the Bay of Rainbows, on Dec. 14, becoming China's first spacecraft to soft land on the surface of an extraterrestrial body. China is the third country to carry out such a rover mission after the United States and the former Soviet Union.
Yutu separated from the Chang'e-3 mothership lander the next day and set foot on the moon, which had not been visited for 38 years since a Soviet Union probe landed in 1976.
And then Yutu and the lander began taking pictures of each other after Yutu moved to a spot about nine meters north of the lander.
In a color image, the ""rabbit"" spreads its arms and ""stares"" at the camera while bearing a Chinese national flag.
The photographs marked the ""complete success"" of the Chang'e-3 mission, according to Ma Xingrui, chief commander of China's lunar program.
Yutu is tasked with surveying the moon's geological structure and surface substances and will also look for natural resources for three months using its radar, panoramic camera, particle X-ray device and infrared imaging equipment.
So far it has collected a large number of scientific images and data, including a 360-degree landscape photo and over 11,000 pieces of data about the moon's surface structures. It has also sampled lunar rocks for analysis back on Earth, according to the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND).
WILL IT BE BACK?
Yutu's waking from its third dormancy suggests that the lunar rover has survived its design life of three months.
With its mechanical abnormality still unsolved, the ailing rover will continue to work, roaming on the moon while commanded by the mission control center, according to SASTIND.
Scientists are still working to check and solve Yutu's mechanical abnormality, hoping it can live as long as possible. Chang'e-2, China's second lunar probe, has been working nearly three years longer than its expected life and is currently 70 million kilometers from Earth as China's first man-made asteroid.
""We hope it will live longer and go on working. We don't mind staying up working every night,"" said Ye Peijian, chief scientist of the Chang'e-3 program.
But checking and fixing the rover's errors is a job almost as complicated as designing and creating a new one, said Ye.
Pei Zhaoyu, spokesman for the lunar program, said that the abnormality came to researchers as a surprise.
""But worry alone solves no problem and we have to work out a solution,"" he said.
Most of the program's researchers gave up their Spring Festival holidays, which coincided with the robot's second dormancy, to spot causes of the problem and work out solutions for any possible situation, Pei said.
Pei said that the robot's second awakening was good news that far exceeded their worst preparations.
Now with another surprising wake-up, people 380,000 kilometers away on Earth are expecting more miracles from the robotic rabbit.
""Big fortune follows a hair-width escape from death,"" wrote Weibo user Yuyinniaoniao, citing a Chinese saying. ""Just follow the example of your 'sister' Chang'e-2 and live longer.""
Though its moon adventure is only a one-way journey, and the robot may end up as space trash, one Weibo user imagined another scene:
""One year later, the little guy from Chang'e-5 mission came, passing by my body which was covered with lunar dust. I sighed. How cold it is during the lunar night! Ten years later, I saw the five-star red flag on the spacesuit, and I was picked up. I was going home,"" wrote user Kevin-Ji Xuetao, replying to a post under the ""Yutu Lunar Rover"" microblog.
""One hundred years later, I heard a kid ask his mum, 'Is it the moon rover Yutu?' There I was, showcased in a museum, watching my peers explore farther and farther in space.""",'% robot%'

REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT
Delivered at the Second Session of the Twelfth National People's Congress on March 5, 2014
Li Keqiang, Premier of the State Council
Fellow Deputies,
On behalf of the State Council, I now present to you the report on the work of the government for your deliberation, and I welcome comments on my report from the members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
I. Review of Work in 2013
Last year was the first year for this government to perform its functions in accordance with the law, and it had arduous tasks. We faced a complex environment: the world economic recovery was difficult. In China, downward pressure on the economy increased, natural disasters occurred frequently, and there was an array of interrelated problems.
However, the people of all of China's ethnic groups, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) with Comrade Xi Jinping as General Secretary, confidently met all challenges, strove to overcome difficulties, fully attained the main targets for economic and social development for the year, and made impressive achievements in reform and opening up and in the socialist modernization drive.
-The economy was stable and improved. The gross domestic product (GDP) reached 56.9 trillion yuan, an increase of 7.7% over the previous year. The rise in the consumer price index (CPI) was kept at 2.6%. The registered urban unemployment rate was kept at 4.1% and 13.1 million urban jobs were created, an all-time high. Total imports and exports exceeded US$4 trillion, reaching a new high.
-Personal income continued to rise, and economic performance continued to improve. The per capita disposable income of urban residents rose by 7% in real terms, and the per capita net income of rural residents rose by 9.3% in real terms. The number of rural people living in poverty was reduced by 16.5 million and the urban-rural income gap continued to narrow. The profits of industrial enterprises with annual revenue of 20 million yuan or more from their main business operations rose by 12.2%. Government revenue increased by 10.1%.
-Progress was achieved in adjusting the economic structure. Grain output exceeded 600 million metric tons, increasing for the tenth consecutive year. The value-added of the service sector accounted for 46.1% of GDP, surpassing secondary industry for the first time. The proportion of the gross regional product of the central and western regions to China's GDP continued to rise, and development in different regions became better balanced. China's total electricity consumption increased by 7.5%, and the volume of freight transport rose by 9.9%. Main real physical indexes matched economic growth.
-Social programs developed vigorously. Progress was made in education, science and technology, culture, and health. The Shenzhou-10 spacecraft was sent into orbit. The Chang'e-3 lunar lander successfully landed on the moon. The submersible Jiaolong broke the record for manned deep-sea dives. All this shows that the Chinese people definitely have the ability and wisdom to achieve the objective of making the country more innovative.
In the last year, we met more difficulties but delivered a better performance than expected. The economy and society developed both quantitatively and qualitatively, thus laying a good foundation for future development. These achievements encourage us to forge ahead and make further progress.
Last year, we adhered to the general work guideline of making progress while maintaining stability. We worked to maintain stable growth, make structural adjustments and carry out reform in a holistic way. We ensured that the government's macro policies are stable, micro policies are flexible and social policies meet people's basic needs. We improved the ways of exercising macro-control and adopted measures with both short-term and long-term benefits in mind. We strove to break new ground, improve quality, and make progress while ensuring stability. All our work got off to a good start.
First, we deepened reform and opening up, invigorated the market, and stimulated internal impetus to growth. In the face of complex international and domestic developments and difficult choices in macro-control, we endeavored to resolve deep-seated problems and difficulties, took reform and opening up as the fundamental way to advance development, and gave full rein to both the invisible hand of the market and the visible hand of the government to promote steady economic growth.
Taking government reform as our starting point, we made accelerating the transformation of government functions, streamlining administration and delegating more power to lower-level governments the top priority of this government.
Reform of State Council bodies was carried out in an orderly manner. We abolished or delegated to lower-level governments 416 items previously subject to State Council review and approval in batches, revised the list of investment projects requiring government review and approval, and carried forward reform of the business registration system.
Local governments actively transformed their functions and reformed their departments, and greatly reduced the matters requiring their review and approval. The pilot project to replace business tax with value-added tax (VAT) was expanded, and 348 administrative fees were either canceled or exempted, thus reducing the burden on businesses by more than 150 billion yuan.
All this further improved the market environment and invigorated businesses. The number of newly registered businesses increased by 27.6% nationwide. Private investment increased to 63% of the country's total investment. Interest rate controls on loans were completely lifted. A trial on implementing the National Equities and Exchange Quotations was carried out nationwide. Unified registration of immovable property was launched. The reform greatly invigorated the market and stimulated development and social creativity, and boosted our efforts to streamline administration and delegate more power to lower-level governments.
We deepened reform endeavors. The China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone was established and the management model of pre-establishment national treatment (PENT) with a negative list was introduced. The vision of establishing a Silk Road economic belt and a 21st century maritime Silk Road was put forward. The China-ASEAN Free Trade Zone was upgraded. Free trade agreements were respectively signed with Switzerland and Iceland.
We implemented the policy to keep increases in foreign trade stable and improved customs, inspection, quarantine and other supervision and control services. Major trade disputes over anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese products, such as photovoltaic solar products, were successfully resolved. We marketed China's high-speed rail and nuclear power technologies and equipment on the international market. China's outbound investment increased significantly. The number of Chinese tourists going overseas reached close to 100 million. The sustained progress of opening up created more space for China's development.
Second, we improved our thinking on and ways of conducting macro-control and ensured that the economy performed within a proper range. In the face of economic fluctuations, we maintained confidence, and stressed the need to maintain steady growth and ensure that employment does not fall below the prescribed minimum level and that inflation does not rise above the projected level. As the economic performance remained within the proper range, we concentrated our efforts on improving the growth model and making structural adjustments by unswervingly following the underlying principles of our macro-control policy. This enhanced public confidence in the market and kept expectations stable.
In the first half of last year, China's exports fluctuated drastically, the economic growth rate continued to decline, central government revenue registered negative growth for the first time in many years, and the inter-bank offered rate for lending rose sharply. There was overseas speculation that China's economy would have a ""hard landing.""
In response to all this, we adhered to a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy. We did not adopt short-term stimulus measures, increase the deficit or issue excessive currency. Instead, we increased effective supply, unleashed potential demand, confidently dealt with short-term market fluctuations, and kept economic activities from sliding out of the proper range. All these efforts reassured the market and played a vital role in sustaining steady economic growth. Last year, the deficit was kept within the budgeted range and the broad money supply (M2) increased by 13.6%, well within the target range.
While keeping macroeconomic policy stable, we made good use of both existing and additional monetary and financial resources. We improved the structure of budgetary expenditures and integrated and cut special transfer payments. The regular expenditures of central Party and government departments and public institutions were cut by 5%, and the regular expenditures of local governments were also reduced. The money saved was used to improve people's lives and grow the economy. Over six million small businesses with low profits benefited from tax breaks. We got a clear picture of total government debt in the whole country through auditing. We tightened financial supervision and liquidity management, thus ensuring sound financial operations.
Third, we focused on adjusting the economic structure and raising the quality and returns of development. To address structural problems that hinder development, we strove to take well-targeted steps and used both the market and differential policies to maintain steady growth while upgrading the economic structure. And we also promoted industrial transformation in the course of carrying out innovation-driven development, thereby raising the quality and returns of development, promoting industrial upgrading and creating conditions for sustaining long-term development.
The foundation of agriculture was consolidated and strengthened. We carried out integrated and comprehensive pilot reforms to modernize agriculture and supported the development of diversified and large-scale farming. Reinforcement of 15,000 small reservoirs was completed. More than 63 million additional rural people gained access to safe drinking water. Ecological conservation and development were strengthened, and China's forest coverage increased to 21.6% of the total land area.
Adjustment of the industrial structure was accelerated. We encouraged the development of the service sector, and supported the development of strategic emerging industries. The 4G mobile communications system was put into commercial operation. We worked actively to resolve the serious problem of excess production capacity in some industries. We tried hard to conserve energy, reduce emissions and prevent and control pollution. Energy intensity was cut by 3.7%, and emissions of sulfur dioxide and chemical oxygen demand decreased by 3.5% and 2.9%, respectively.
Infrastructure was strengthened. The first phase of the eastern route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project was put into operation ahead of plan, and the main part of the first phase of the central route was completed as planned. Underground pipe networks and other urban infrastructure were improved. Oil, natural gas and electric power networks were expanded, and electricity generated from non-fossil energy amounted to 22.3% of the total electricity output. Civil aviation, water transport, information and postal service networks were improved. The total length of expressways and railways in service both exceeded 100,000 kilometers, with the length of high-speed railways in service reaching 11,000 kilometers, ranking first in the world.
We continued to pursue innovation-driven development. China's R&D spending accounted for over 2% of its GDP. We deepened reform of the science and technology management system and implemented knowledge and technology innovation projects. Major breakthroughs were made in a number of key technologies, such as the building of supercomputers and smart robots and the cultivation of super-hybrid rice.
Fourth, we ensured and improved people's wellbeing and upheld social fairness and justice. At a time when government expenditures exceeded government revenue by a large amount, we took improving people's wellbeing as the starting point and goal of our work, gave high priority to improving the relevant systems, ensured that people's basic living needs are met, and promoted the development of social programs.
We ensured that the people have access to basic daily necessities. We implemented the program for promoting employment of university graduates, thus enabling the vast majority of new college graduates to find jobs. We improved employment services and vocational skills training for rural migrant workers, and provided employment assistance to urban residents having difficulties in finding jobs. We improved the systems of social aid and old-age insurance. Subsistence allowances for urban and rural residents were raised by 13.1% and 17.7% respectively, and basic pension benefits for enterprise retirees were increased by 10%. Construction of 6.66 million government-subsidized housing units was started, and 5.44 million such housing units were basically completed. Thanks to these efforts, over ten million people with housing difficulties moved into new homes.
We promoted education development and reform. We launched the project to alleviate poverty through education and continued to implement the plan to improve poorly built and low performing rural schools providing compulsory education. The project to improve nutrition of rural students covered 32 million students, and living allowances were issued to rural teachers in contiguous poor areas. The number of students from poor rural areas who were enrolled by key colleges and universities increased by 8.5% over the previous year.
We deepened reform of the medical and health care systems. The basic medical insurance system now covers all the population in general, and the per capita government subsidy for rural and urban residents covered by this system increased to 280 yuan. The system of using basic medicines was implemented in over 80% of village clinics. Pilot programs of medical insurance covering major diseases were carried out in 28 provincial-level administrative areas. A trial project was launched to provide emergency assistance for disease treatment. We comprehensively implemented the national project to provide basic public health services. Six million rural women received free pre-pregnancy checkups.
We promoted the sound development of the cultural sector. A number of high-quality cultural works were produced, and more public cultural facilities were opened free of charge. We deepened reform of the cultural management system and developed the market for cultural products. The added value of the culture industry increased by over 15%. We improved the national fitness service system, and successfully held the Twelfth National Games in an economic way.",'% robot%'

April Fools' Day is not all about pranks. China's Internet giant Baidu is dead serious about its plan? to be launched on April 1?to include science fiction writers in its research on artificial intelligence.
The Baidu Verne Plan involves setting up a consulting team to bring the world's best science fiction writers together with leading scientists in a quest to turn imagination into reality.
The project, named after French novelist Jules Verne, has already invited six people to be the first group of advisers in the team, according to Beijing-based Baidu.
The company said that some of Verne's imagination seen in his books in the 19th century, such as helicopters, had been realized in the 20th century.
Apart from Andrew Ng, Baidu's chief scientist, the other five advisers are science fiction writers. They include Liu Cixin, who last year became the first Asian author to win the Hugo Award for Best Novel for his book The Three-Body Problem, and David Brin, an award-winning author from the United States.
Baidu said in a statement that the advisers will receive updated information on how the company is developing certain technologies.
They will also be able to communicate with Baidu's research and development team to turn some of the ideas into products through brainstorming.
Liu Cixin told The Paper in an interview: ""This is an innovative organization. Many ideas, along with innovative work, will be born here. The project will focus on artificial intelligence, and there will be an opportunity for us to work with scientists once the project is officially launched.""
Baidu said the project is highly exclusive, open only by invitation.
It is in line with the company's ambitions, as its President Zhang Yaqin has said artificial intelligence is the foundation to empower traditional industries and make them smart. He told China Daily, ""Baidu has made some world-class achievements in the key subfields of artificial intelligence, such as image recognition, voice recognition, machine translation and self-driving cars.""
Artificial intelligence is viewed by many other Chinese companies as the next ""big thing"", especially after Google's AlphaGo artificial intelligence program beat a South Korean world-class Go player recently.
Industry insiders say computers are likely to replace humans in a number of areas.
Beijing-based Internet finance company Jimu.com said it is about to launch a service using robots to offer wealth management advice to middle-class clients.
Dong Jun, the company's chief executive officer, said, ""Through deep learning, it is possible that the machines will be able to calculate investment risk, predict investment yield and offer tailor-made financial advice to individuals after analyzing a huge pool of data.""",'% robot%'

On April 12, a surgical robot was used at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University to perform minimally invasive operation for two patients suffering from gastric cancer.
The surgical robot using da Vinci Surgical System is 1.8 meters tall, and has ""three heads and four arms"".
It allows the surgeon’s hand movements to be translated into smaller, precise movements of tiny instruments inside the patient’s body and it gives the surgeon a 3D HD view inside the patient's body too.
Compared with traditional surgery, the surgical robot using da Vinci Surgical System has unmatched stability and accuracy, featuring less trauma and bleeding and faster recovery.

It was difficult to imagine just 10 years ago how a robot could help you select projects instead of financial advisers when managing money, but nowadays artificial intelligence technology is being increasingly used in investment and wealth management services.
Internet-based equity financing and investment service provider InnoTREE Co Ltd on Tuesday launched a service using robots to offer equity investment advice to investors.
Ma Chao, founder of InnoTREE, said: ""The robot could first establish a database, which covers the investment and financing information of more than 130,000 startups, and then track and analyze the daily operation situation of these startups or their projects.""
Ma said the robot will analyze the business model of these projects, categorize and evaluate them, and finally select the startups that are worth making investments in through its modeling and calculation.
""The workload of a robot each minute is equivalent to the workload of an experienced analyst working for 40 hours. Its cognition level is same as an investment manager with three to four years of investment experience,"" said Teng Fang, co-founder of the company.
It is the first time that robots are being applied in the equity investment market.
Yi Jigang, president of Orient Jiyi Investment, a Beijing-based private equity firm, told China Daily that the amount of equity investment is very small, but has huge development potential.
""AI technology will make the equity market more effective and efficient,"" Yi said.
""AI technology won't shock the investment industry but promote it. People could make use of the technological achievements to devote more time and energy do other higher-level business, and improve working efficiency and value by virtue of advanced machine tools,"" Yi added.
Another Beijing-based internet finance company, Jimu.com, said earlier this month it was going to launch a service using robots to offer wealth management advice to clients.
It is possible that the machines will be able to calculate investment risk, predict investment yield and offer customized financial advice through deep learning and analyzing huge amounts of data, said Dong Jun, the company's chief executive officer.
Yang Fan, a researcher at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys International, told China Daily that ""AI technology could only play an auxiliary role in the equity investment market as a huge pool of fake information exists in the market and the machine couldn't identify its authenticity.""
Yang said that AI technology will not fully replace humans, but may help humans by doing low-efficiency and trivial jobs, which could save time and energy for humans to do more creative work, adding some high-risk equity investment should still be done by humans.",'% robot%'

British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking announced here Tuesday he is teaming up with Russian billionaire Yuri Milner and a group of scientists for a new ""Starshot"" space exploration program, which will build tiny spacecraft called ""nanocraft"" capable of reaching the Alpha Centauri star system in approximately 20 years after launch. (Xinhua/Li Changxiang)
NEW YORK, April 12 -- World-renowned British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking on Tuesday teamed up with Russian billionaire Yuri Milner and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in a 100-million-U.S.-dollar effort to make tiny spaceships capable of interstellar space travel.
Hawking and Milner made the joint announcement at a press conference held at One World Observatory in New York City Tuesday.
The project, dubbed ""Breakthrough Starshot,"" is a research and engineering program that aims to build laser beam propelled ""nanocrafts"" that can travel at 20 percent of lightspeed -- more than 1000 times faster than current fastest spacecraft.
According to Milner, once the ""nanocrafts"" are built, they could reach Alpha Centauri, a star 4.37 light-years away, approximately 20 years in a fly-by mission.
Alpha Centauri is one of the closest star systems to the solar system and the current fastest spacecraft would have to spend 30,000 years to get there.
The ""nanocrafts"" are gram-scale robotic spacecrafts consisting of two main parts: a computer CPU sized ""StarChip"" and a ""Lightsail"" made with metamaterials no more than a few hundred atoms thick.
Although weighing just a few grams, the ""StarChip"" is a fully functional space probe, which carries various equipment including cameras, navigation and communication.
""The 'StarChip' can be mass-produced at the cost of an iPhone,"" Milner said.
The ""nanocrafts"" can then be propelled into space by a powerful laser beam, which according to Avi Loeb, a theoretical physicist and panelist at the news conference, will carry a power of 100 gigawatt.
""This is the power needed to lift off a space shuttle,"" Loeb said.
Milner and the scientists believe that with the rising power and falling costs of lasers, the entire process is practical within a couple of years.
""Fifteen years ago, it wouldn't have made sense to make this investment. Now we've looked at the numbers, and it does,"" Milner said.
The project was part of the Breakthrough Initiatives first launched in July 2015 by Hawking and Milner, including a series of research plans to scan the 100 galaxies closest to the Milky Way in search for aliens. ""Starshot"" is its newest endeavor.
Hawking believes that human's innate sense to transcend limits is the driving force behind the project. ""Gravity pins us to the ground, but I just flew to America.""
While one cannot hear the joking tone through Hawking's voice synthesizer, his humor had been easily received.
What the scientists are looking for is not just reaching Alpha Centauri, but what can be learned during the efforts.
""A lot of science will be learned by the process of going through this, making this happen,"" said panelist Mae Jemison, a former NASA astronaut. ""There's big task ahead, there's a big leap in getting something of a micro size to go at some percentage of the speed of light. That will have all kinds of reverberations.""
Tuesday also marked the 55th anniversary of the first human space flight by Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.
""Today we commit to this next great leap into the cosmos because we are human and our nature is to fly,"" Hawking said.",'% robot%'

The monastery also has its own IT and animation teams, both composed of monks who graduated from top universities like Tsinghua University and Beihang University.
For instance, Master Xianxin, who majored in computer science and graduated from the Beijing University of Technology, is the head of the IT team. He manages digital technology for the temple, as well as the information platform that he built with the help of volunteers.
Liu Zhiyu, a math whiz and recent graduate from Beijing University, gave up a full scholarship offered by the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the U.S. in order to become a monk at Longquan Temple.
One rumor even says that it was a monk from the temple who advised Zhang Xiaolong, creator of China’s WeChat messaging service, when Zhang met some roadblocks during the research and development phase.
In addition to the monks, there are also more than 300 volunteers living in the monastery, some of who also graduated from top universities and won prestigious math honors.

A Chinese tech startup has teamed up with an American toy company to design a compact robot disguised as a tablet.
Xiaomi worked with Hasbro in creating Soundwave, a copy of the firm's Mi Pad 2 that turns into a flashy Transformer action figure.
The slim, metal encased tablet folds out into a 3D black and gold robot, but unfortunately it just looks like a tablet – it doesn't actually work like one.
Soundwave is being produced in honor of Xiaomi's sixth anniversary and it's reported the toy will be part of crowdfunding campaign.
Transformer fans can get this unique toy for 129 Yuan or $20 and open up orders for its 'Transformers Special Edition' on April 6th, reports Gizmo China.
'Xiaomi and Hasbro are collaborating for the first time crowdfunding a kickass robot model named Soundwave in China,' Hugh Barra, vice president of Xiaomi, shared in a Facebook post.
'Instead of a vehicle transforming into a robot, this time, it's Mi Pad 2 that gets the Transformers treatment.'
The bot turns into a slim seven millimeter rectangle and folds back with a 30-step process.
Dimensions of this special edition are exact to the real Mi Pad 2, which has a 7.9 screen.
'R&D worked really hard to ensure that the color, details and feel are exactly the same as Mi Pad 2,' Barra shared.
'They were challenged at turning such a slim 7mm tablet into a 3D robot, but they managed to do so with a 30-step folding assembly.'
Xiaomi unveiled the working Mi Pad 2 in November of last year, which was also said to share design notes with Apple devices.
WHAT ARE THE DETAILS OF SOUNDWAVE?

The bot folds up into a slim seven millimeter rectangle and folds back with a 30-step process.
Dimensions of this special edition are exact to the real Mi Pad 2, which has a 7.9 screen.
The tablet is encased in an aluminium structure – similar to the iPad mini.
Xiaomi says the Mi Pad 2 is lighter and thinner than the first-generation Mi Pad, and comes with 2GB of RAM, 16GB or 64GB of internal storage, and a 7.9-inch, 2048 x 1536 resolution screen.
It's also going for $199.99 and runs on Windows OS, which allows you to install Office software and use the tablet just like you would a laptop or desk top.
'It is very convenient, because your way of work on the tablet will be similar to the work on the computer,' says Xiamoi.
'Mi Pad 2 is more convenient and more compact than a laptop, put it in a bag or in a pocket, and tablet is always at your hand.'

Recently, a British teenager named Billy Whitaker had his epilepsy cured thanks in part to the efforts of a robot surgeon. With minute accuracy, the robot pinpointed the epicenter of Whitaker’s debilitating attacks and drilled electrodes deep into his brain to remove the tiny piece of seizure-causing tissue.
Whitaker’s case was not the first instance of robots successfully performing surgery. To qualify as a robot surgeon, a robot must possess three major items: sufficiently advanced software and hardware (a brain), a sensor (eyes), and electromechanical devices (hands).
The “brain” works similarly to our computers at home, but its operating system is usually optimized to increase the stability of its software. “Eyes” usually refers to features like pressure sensors and/or video image capture devices. The “eyes” are in charge of collecting information and transferring it to the “brain,” which then issues commands for the “hands” to perform.
Most medical robots today are based on “Leonardo’s robot,” a design originally completed by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century and rediscovered in the 1950s. Doctors sit in front of a screen and use a sort of joystick to perform surgeries. The most important feature of these surgeries is that doctors are able to adjust the scale based on specific needs, which is especially beneficial for delicate and hyperfine surgeries. However, these ”robot surgeries” are usually much more expensive than regular ones.
In addition to robot surgeons, there are also robot chefs and robot executives. With the rapid development and increasing use of artificial intelligence across many fields, it is likely that more and more robots will make significant contributions to humanity.",'% robot%'

The United States is expected to be the most competitive manufacturing nation by the year 2020, pushing China into the number two position, according to the 2016 Global Manufacturing Competitiveness Index report jointly released by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (Deloitte Global) and the Council on Competitiveness.
The report’s prediction is based on in-depth analysis of survey responses from more than 500 chief executive officers and senior leaders at manufacturing companies across the world.
In 2013, China ranked first in manufacturing competitiveness, followed by Germany and the U.S. The report notes that manufacturing is sustainable, smart, safe and growing, and the U.S. is expected to remain among the leaders in this industry.
However, while the U.S. may remain competitive, China has realized the seriousness of the problems holding back its own manufacturing, and has pushed forward reforms to address those issues.
""We will apply higher standards to spur the upgrade of 'made in China' goods,"" Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said at a regular meeting of the State Council on April 6. China will make sure that at least 90 percent of its standards for domestic equipment manufacturing are brought up to international standards by 2020, according to the State Council. Advances will also be sought in key sectors including robotics, rail transportation equipment, agricultural machinery and high-performance medical equipment.
In addition, China has unveiled a series of policies that support tax revenue and technical innovation in the financial sector. Between ""Made in China 2025"" and ""Internet Plus,"" China has taken undeniable steps to improve the quality of China-made goods and enhance the competitiveness of Chinese enterprises.

Other reasons listed in the report for China’s decreasing manufacturing competitiveness include the country’s ageing population, economic slowdown and rising labor costs. However, China has taken measures to address these problems, such as adjusting the family planning policy, economic restructuring and transformation, and promoting the robotics industry. These changes will surely have a significant impact on the country's manufacturing industry in the future.
In a word, while the government has already made some positive changes, China should continue to learn from the advanced technology in the West to increase its competitiveness in manufacturing.",'% robot%'

Recently, a robotic monk named ""Xianer"" has become an Internet sensation. At 60 centimeters high, Xianer can talk with humans and understand simple orders. What distinguishes him from other robots with those abilities is the fact that he wears a yellow robe and discourses on the Buddhist dharma. Xianer is the joint project of Buddhist masters at Longquan Temple in Beijing and various AI experts.
Xianer was born last October. Recently, a netizen posted a photo of Xianer on his Weibo, and the post was soon shared by many fans. Some people came to Longquan Temple just to see him.
Xianer has speech recognition ability, which allows him to engage in simple dialogue with humans. You can ask him: ""who are you,"" ""how old are you,"" ""who is your master,"" and other questions. In addition, he can receive orders and make corresponding body movements, chant Buddhist sutras and play Buddhist music.
Xianer is widely liked, and many people have even expressed interest in buying their own Xianers. However, according to Master Xianfan, director of the animation center of Longquan Temple, there is currently only one Xianer robot monk. ""After all, this is not a commercial endeavor,"" the director explained. ""We made Xianer to preach Buddhist doctrines in a modern way.""

Meanwhile, officials are investigating an oil slick about 5,500 meters from the area where the last underwater sounds were detected, said Angus Houston, head of the joint agency that is coordinating the search off Australia’s west coast.
Crews collected an oil sample and are sending it back to Australia for analysis, a process that will take several days. Houston said it does not appear to be from any of the ships in the area, but cautioned against jumping to conclusions about its source.
Bluefin 21 was launched from the Australian navy ship Ocean Shield.
The move comes after a series of underwater sounds over the past two weeks consistent with signals from an aircraft’s black boxes.
The devices emit “pings” so they can be more easily found, but their batteries only last about a month and are now believed dead.
“Today is day 38 of the search,” Houston told a news conference. “We haven’t had a single detection in six days, so I guess it’s time to go under water.”
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott raised hopes last week when he said authorities were “very confident” the four strong underwater signals that were detected were from the black boxes of the Malaysia Airlines plane, which disappeared on March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing with 239 people on board, mostly Chinese.
But Houston warned that while the signals are a promising lead, the public needs to be realistic about the challenges facing search crews in the extremely remote, deep patch of ocean — an area he called “new to man.”
“I would caution you against raising hopes that the deployment of the autonomous underwater vehicle will result in the detection of the aircraft wreckage. It may not,” Houston said. “However, this is the best lead we have, and it must be pursued vigorously.”
The Ocean Shield had been dragging a US Navy device called a towed pinger locator through the water to listen for any sounds from the black boxes’ beacons.
The Bluefin sub takes six times longer to cover the same area as the ping locator, and the two devices can’t be used at the same time. Crews had been hoping to detect additional signals before sending down the sub, so they could triangulate the source and zero in on where the black boxes may be.
The submarine will take 24 hours to complete each mission: two hours to dive to the bottom, 16 hours to search the ocean floor, two hours to return to the surface, and four hours to download the data, Houston said.
The black boxes could contain the key to unraveling the mystery. Investigators believe the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean based on a flight path calculated from its contacts with a satellite and an analysis of its speed and fuel capacity. But they still don’t know why.

China has the ability to detect signals sent from deep in the sea, but the month-long hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has exposed technological drawbacks in China's maritime search and rescue outfit, experts said.
Chinese patrol ship Haixun 01 picked up electronic pulsing signals in the Indian Ocean on Friday and again on Saturday. But some foreign experts are skeptical about whether China's equipment is advanced enough to obtain signals from as deep as 4,500 meters under the sea.
Tech gap exposed in plane's search mission
The ship is equipped with maritime detection equipment, including one black box sonar detector and two underwater robots, said Wang Liangyu, head of maritime survey at the Donghai Navigation Safety Administration under the Ministry of Transport.
""All of them were imported,"" he said. ""The black box detector, which was made by the same company that produces black boxes, has a maximum detection range of 5,000 meters.""
The adoption of such advanced technologies has enabled China to catch ""ping"" signals from the black boxes, he told Shanghai newspaper Jiefang Daily.
However, searchers need more time to analyze and verify the signals to see whether they are consistent with the black boxes - the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder.
Many Chinese applauded Haixun 01's findings, but say China still lags behind other nations when it comes to maritime search and rescue equipment.
""I'm proud that it was our ship that first detected the (suspected) signals,"" said an Internet user who goes under the name biedong1925, ""but it is a pity that none of the equipment used was made in China"".
Some experts said more resources and investment should be allocated to China's maritime search and rescue outfit development.
""There are a lot of things that China should do to upgrade its equipment used in maritime search and rescue operations,"" said Cui Yiliang, an expert on ships and naval armament in Beijing.
""We must speed up the research and development of autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs,"" he said. ""High-tech underwater vehicles such as the Bluefin-21 play an irreplaceable role in deep-sea detection and retrieval operations, but I haven't read any reports about similar equipment developed in China.""
The torpedo-shaped Bluefin-21 underwater vehicle can operate to a depth of nearly 4,500 meters beneath the waves and is equipped with a variety of sonar equipment and cameras that can detect debris at great depths on the ocean floor. It transmits information about locations to nearby ships on the surface, according to the United States Naval Institute.
The Australian navy vessel Ocean Shield is carrying a Bluefin-21 in its current search and will use the sub to scan for wreckage once the black box is located.
AUV played a critical role in locating a lost Air France jet in 2011, two years after it crashed in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. A team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the United States used an AUV equipped with side-scan sonar to locate the aircraft about 3,900 meters underwater.
In China, the AUV is still in its infancy and far from being operational, Cui said.
In November, the Qianlong-1 unmanned autonomous underwater vehicle completed its first application test in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
Co-developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Harbin Engineering University, it can travel to a depth of 6,000 meters, and is tasked to explore the seabed and collect hydrological data. The vehicle is on a trial run and marks the first time a Chinese AUV has been used for a scientific expedition, according to the academy.
Meanwhile, a military observer said the Chinese navy should improve its use of sea-based air platforms in maritime search and rescue operations.
The PLA navy's missile destroyer Haikou, replenishment ship Qiandaohu, and amphibian landing craft Kunlunshan and Jinggangshan are taking part in the search mission led by Australia in a remote part of the Indian Ocean.
However, the fleet ""apparently failed to bring enough helicopters"", said the observer in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, who declined to be named.
The two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers of the US Navy that had participated in the early search for MH370, the USS Pinckney and USS Kidd, each carried two MH-60R Seahawk helicopters, which flew sorties from dawn to dusk.
""Each Arleigh Burke-class destroyer can carry up to four helicopters, which means it has a strong capability to search on the sea,"" the observer said, adding Chinese destroyers and frigates can carry only one helicopter.
The amphibian landing craft Kunlunshan and Jinggangshan can each embark up to four helicopters, he said. ""But judging from news reports, they didn't bring that number of helicopters. The only guess I can make is that our navy still needs to learn from the US Navy in the use of sea-based air platforms.""",'% robot%'
163,peopleschina,2014-04-22 00:00:00.000000,2014,http://en.people.cn/90777/8605230.html,"PERTH, Australia - From the disappearances of aviator Amelia Earhart to labor union leader Jimmy Hoffa, there's just something about a good mystery that Americans find too tantalizing to resist. Perhaps that's why the saga of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has continued to rivet the country long after people elsewhere have moved on.
From the beginning, the story has bubbled with enough drama to rival a good Hollywood whodunit. And even though it unfolded on the other side of the world with only three Americans on board, many were sucked in anyway.
""This story has many ingredients of compelling drama, particularly early on: lives at stake, mystery unsolved, a race against time, human emotion,"" Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, said in an email.
Many found it impossible to believe that a modern Boeing 777 carrying 239 people could just vanish without a trace in an age where an iPhone can be tracked just about anywhere.
And so they tuned in to watch the latest developments. And when there were no new developments, they stayed glued to their smartphones because the suspense of not knowing - or possibly missing something new - somehow spiked when nothing was going on. From oil slicks to pings from dying black boxes, each new lead provided a salacious morsel that drove viewers to wonder: Will this be it?
""I find myself drawn into watching or reading about it because it has taken on seemingly mythic worldwide importance,"" Paul Mones, an attorney from Portland, Oregon wrote in an email. ""In this modern world we simply refuse to accept that something so concrete can get so out of our physical reach and understanding. ... People just refuse to concede that the cause of the disaster will likely forever remain unknown.""
After six weeks of breathless reporting, not one shred of hard evidence has been found from the jetliner. An unmanned underwater submarine is now using sonar to comb the ocean floor at a depth exceeding 4 1/2 kilometers (2.8 miles) off the west coast of Australia. It is desperately trying to spot something - anything - that resembles wreckage in an area where signals believed to be coming from the plane's dying black boxes were heard.
According to the latest survey by the Pew Research Center conducted April 3-6, the missing plane remained the top news story in the U.S., with 33 percent of people saying they followed it over a deadly shooting at Fort Hood Army base, developments related to Ukraine and President Obama's health care overhaul. That's down from 39 percent in the previous March questionnaire, when nearly half of those asked said they thought the hunt for MH370 was being given the right amount of coverage.
CNN covered the drama ad nauseam for weeks, once breaking into one of its programs to report that objects recovered from the sea could be trash - which is exactly what it proved to be. They featured tons of go-to footage from a flight simulator and a nonstop spool of speculation from talking heads. Everyone had a theory, with some sounding more like a Twilight Zone rerun than a newscast: Could a black hole or even something supernatural be behind the aircraft's March 8 disappearance?
Last week, Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts, Jr., begged CNN to scale it back.
""Enough, already,"" he wrote. ""Give us a break from the missing plane. ... Put your hands up and step away from the story.""
But even though its coverage was mocked by ""The Daily Show"" and spoofed by ""Saturday Night Live,"" Americans kept watching, and the 24-hour news network's ratings kept soaring. CNN, which declined to comment for this story, reported itself that the all-important 25- to 54-year-old viewer demographic more than doubled after its plane reporting began.
But why did interest remain so high in the U.S. when the story lost steam elsewhere? It dropped from most Australian front pages and web sites weeks ago, despite the search being coordinated off its western coast. CNN International tapered its coverage when other big news broke, such as the crisis in Ukraine and the Oscar Pistorius trial in South Africa, even though the missing jetliner was actually an overseas story. Even in China, where two-thirds of the passengers were from, reports never ran nonstop on TV and the clamor on social media also died down.
Still, Americans yearned for more.
A month and a half into the massive search that has involved scores of countries scouring thousands upon thousands of ocean miles, the plane was still among the top three stories Sunday on Google news. The only new development was that a robotic submarine was expected to finish its sweep of the seabed in a week.
Part of the obsession may also revolve around the country's gotta-know-now mentality and its social media addiction that gets fed 24/7 by the latest breaking news, raw footage or photos going viral on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Since the plane disappeared, it has consistently been one of the top five most-read stories on The Associated Press' mobile app.
A combination of popular TV shows and a history peppered with real-life detective dramas, from who shot President John F. Kennedy to the identity of Watergate source ""Deep Throat,"" may have been factors that tempted Americans to latch onto it.
""It's almost like all the seasons of 'Lost' was the promotional period for this story,"" said Robert Thompson, a pop culture expert at Syracuse University.
""We have always kind of put a lot of our popular national narrative into these mysteries and conspiracies and all of the rest of it,"" he added. ""And this is a pretty powerful one.""",'% robot%'

BEIJING, June 13 -- Two development officials from the United Nations have written an analytical report to introduce ""China Manufacturing 2025"", also called ""Made in China 2025"", and recommended this strategy to other countries to avoid the middle-income trap.
The report, entitled ""Learning from China's Industrial Strategy"", was written by Richard Kozul-Wright, Director of the Division on Globalization and Development Strategies at the UN Conference on Trade and Development, and Daniel Poon, an Economic Affairs Officer at the UN Conference on Trade and Development.
To avoid the fate of what Harvard University economist Dani Rodrik called ""premature deindustralization"", China has turned to its ""Manufacturing 2025"", a roadmap released by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in 2015 to guide the country's industrial modernization, the report said.
""The strategy focuses on developing advanced manufacturing sectors, but also considers how producer services, services-oriented manufacturing, and green technologies can complement that process,"" said the report.
The concept of ""Made in China"" was first put forward by Li in his government work report in 2015. In May 2015, China's State Council announced ""Made in China 2025"" as a national initiative to improve the manufacturing industry -- initially up to 2025, then to 2035 and 2049.
The goal is to transform China into a leading manufacturing power. ""Policy and financial support will be provided to spur technological breakthroughs in ten key areas, including next-generation information technology; high-end computer-controlled machine tools and robotics; space and aviation equipment; alternative-energy vehicles; and bio-medicine and high-performance medical device,"" the report introduced.
""According to China's strategy, by 2025, the country should have a set of internationally competitive multinational firms that have made progress in upgrading their positions in global value chains.""
""Moreover, by that date, key Chinese industries should adopt international efficiency standards related to energy and material consumption and pollution. By 2035, China expects its economy to be fully industrialized,"" it added.
The article also introduced the strategy's less-noticed yet equally important innovative financial and investment policies.
""This approach, China hopes, can drive progress toward its objectives for upgrading and reform, by creating a set of purpose-build financing vehicles -- so-called government guidance funds -- that are responsible for allocating public investment funds.""
""As a report by McKinsey &Company puts it, this 'more market-based investment approach' is a 'bold experiment designed to improve the likelihood of success,"" the article said.
If ""Made in China 2025"" succeeds, the report said, ""it will have laid the institutional foundations for new sources of growth. And, as the benefits of innovation are diffused throughout the economy, China will move closer to its goal: becoming a high-income country.""
""China's experiments with industrial and financial policies may end up providing emerging economies with valuable insight into how to avoid the middle-income trap,"" the report concluded.",'% robot%'

BEIJING, June 12 -- The Precise Service System of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) has been used in creating 317 smart cities in China, according to the Smart BDS Precise Application Summit opened on Monday.
BDS Precise Service System can provide precise positioning services for household gas and heat, power grid, water supplies,drainage and smart transportation.
Sun Jiadong, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said Beidou has a wide range of applications and its precise positioning services should be developed practically.
Beidou precise positioning services have been used in Beijing Gas Group to detect and locate gas leaks in pipelines.
Ran Chengqi, an official at Beidou Navigation Satellite System, said with the development of Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence, there will be an increasing need for precise positioning in industries like unmanned vehicles, drones and robots.
The value of the Beidou industrial chain could reach 240 billion yuan by 2020.",'% robot%'

It will be the first attempt by an AI to tackle the world’s largest-scale exam.
The computer challenger, AI-MATHS, is an artificial intelligence program designed by Chengdu Zhunxing Yunxue Technology using big data and natal language recognition. Though labeled a robot, AI-MATHS is actually an assembly of over 10 servers, which jointly run an artificial intelligence system. According to the company, AI-MATHS will not only take the math exam used in most regions in China, it will also attempt to complete several provincial math tests.
Joining 9.4 million students taking the exam this year, the robot will begin the test after 5 p.m., when the test for students across the nation is already over. Like most students, AI-MATHS has prepared stringently for the gaokao. It completed 500 sets of practical exercises, including around 12,000 questions, said Lin Hui, chief executive of Chengdu Zhunxing Yunxue Technology.
This is not the first time the robot has attempted a math test. In February, it scored 93 out of 150 on a different math exam, a mark only slightly higher than the passing grade of 90. According to Lin, natural language recognition is the robot's biggest obstacle, as it lacks the ability to make lexical inferences.
“The robot cannot deduce the meaning of new words through context. For instance, the abbreviation for tangent can be ‘tan’ and ‘tg,’ but AI-MATHS can only solve problems containing ‘tan,’ as it has never encountered ‘tg’ before,” explained Lin.
Similar robots have previously been developed by researchers from other nations, but the results are not promising. Japanese scientists have abandoned efforts started in 2011 to make a robot that can score high enough on an entrance exam to gain admission to the University of Tokyo.
China has been working hard to develop a high-scoring robot to take on the gaokao. According to Xinhua, China’s Ministry of Science and Technology has announced a plan to develop special gaokao robots. By 2020, the ministry hopes that AI robots will be smart enough to earn scores that would gain them admission to leading universities.",'% robot%'

Premier Li Keqiang is scheduled on Wednesday to kick off his trip to Berlin, which analysts and officials said is expected to boost China-Europe free trade and inject impetus to the global economic recovery.
During the three-day trip, Li will pay official visits to Germany and Belgium, attend the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and meet with leaders of the European Union under an annual mechanism in Brussels, according to the Foreign Ministry.
Through the visit, China expects to enhance strategic communication to strengthen political trust, improve practical cooperation and jointly send a positive signal of cooperation, openness and win-win values, said Vice-Foreign Minister Wang Chao.
China and Europe don't have fundamental contradictions or geographic conflicts, and they have many common interests and similar stances on issues such as boosting free trade, safeguarding the multilateral trade system and improving global economic governance, he said.
Wang also called for joint efforts to handle and resolve disputes properly in a constructive manner, and take each other's core interests and major concerns into consideration.
Yang Yanyi, China's ambassador to the European Union, told Xinhua News Agency that both parties should send positive signals of jointly safeguarding peace and promoting development at a time when economic globalization faces setbacks with rising challenges of pro¬tec¬tion¬ism.
The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative has led to cooperation be¬tween China and European countries in airport and seaport construction, finance and rail transportation, she said.
It's natural that China and Europe have disagreements in developing bilateral economic and trade ties, she said, adding that the two sides should focus on common interests and control trade conflicts through dialogue and consultation.
During Li's visit to Germany, leaders of the two countries will exchange views on Article 15 in the protocol on China's accession to the World Trade Organization, China's ambassador to Germany, Shi Mingde, told the China Radio International.
According to Article 15, WTO member nations should have ceased on Dec 11, 2016, from using the surrogate country approach in anti-dumping investigations on China. This date was 15 years after China became an official member of the organization.
Under the surrogate country approach, WTO members use costs of production in a third country to calculate the value of products from countries on its ""non-market economy"" list, which includes China.
It's an obligation for the EU members, including Germany, to stop using the surrogate country approach while conducting anti-dumping investigations into China, Shi said.
Li Chenggang, assistant minister of commerce, said China became Germany's largest trade partner for the first time last year, when the bilateral trade volume reached $151.29 billion.
The EU has been China's largest trade partner for many years, and China is the EU's second largest trade partner. The two sides have made positive progress in cooperation in infrastructure, finance and digital economy in recent years, Li said.
The economies of China and Belgium are highly complementary and the two countries have huge potential regarding trade in chemicals, food, finance, bio-pharmacy, environmental protection and life science, he said.
Wang Mingjin, a professor of international relations at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said cooperation agree¬ments be¬tween small and medium-sized enterprises in China and European Union members will be a highlight of Li's visit.
As a manufacturing giant, China has great potential in cooperating with the EU members in machinery production, environmental protection and robotics, he said.
Li's visit also will enhance cooperation between China and Europe in pushing forward globalization, free trade and open markets, he added.
Cui Hongjian, director of the Department for European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, said the EU faces challenges, including the uncertainties caused by the power transfer in some EU members.
China and the EU should overcome the difficulties, focus more on the positive factors and join hands to fight protectionism, he said, adding the two sides have disagreements in some areas including the identification of China's status as a market-oriented economy.
China and European countries could make joint efforts to push forward the Belt and Road Initiative and enhance cooperation in such areas as maritime exploitation, infrastructure and finance, he said.

Editor's note: In the run-up to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China Daily will cover a series of key projects and advanced equipment of national importance, showcasing the country's huge improvements and relentless efforts in manufacturing upgrading and innovation.
China Railway Rolling Stock Corp, the country's railway vehicle manufacturer, plans to establish 11 regional branches throughout the world by 2020 and further target key markets including Europe, North America, Russia and Central Asian countries, said a top executive.
The 11 regional branches will be set up in countries such as Russia, the United Kingdom, South Africa and Australia. The company wants to manufacture trains, purchase parts, and build maintenance and service facilities through a localization strategy and hiring local employees in key markets in 2020.
CRRC set up its first regional branch for North America in Massachusetts last year. The branch is designed to coordinate its businesses and participate in project bidding in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
CRRC President Xi Guohua said the group plans to conclude one or two overseas acquisition deals this year and accelerate exports of both its products and technical standards for 160-kilometer-per-hour electric trains, cargo EMU trains, new energy trains and piggyback wagons.
CRRC is currently in talks with the Czech Republic's Skoda Transportation AS for a 100 percent stake, a move to increase its market share in Europe's railway markets.
The Czech company mainly produces trams, electric locomotives, carriages and electric buses, as well as traction motors and complete drives for traffic systems. If the deal is sealed, this will be the first time the Chinese group has taken over a full-set rail transit equipment manufacturer.
""Our market development strategy has already shifted from only shipping trains to overseas markets to building a global network to compete with established foreign rivals,"" said Xi.
CRRC hopes to take a 10 to 15 percent global market share and is expecting to raise the total volume of its overseas orders to $15 billion in 2020.
""Even though a lot of money can be made from selling trains, providing maintenance services and selling trains directly in overseas markets can also be profitable and convenient,"" said Feng Hao, a rail transportation researcher at the National Development and Reform Commission.
The competition is fierce. Foreign rivals such as Siemens AG of Germany, France's Alstom Group and Bombardier Inc of Canada, have all built their global service and sales networks to boost their sales revenue in major overseas markets in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.
CRRC has so far pushed a number of products, including high-speed trains that can run at 350 kph, middle-to-low speed magnetically levitated shuttles, high-speed commuter trains running at a maximum speed of 140 kph, piggyback wagons, hydrogen-powered tramcars and oil-electricity hybrid locomotive, into both the global and domestic markets.
In addition to producing trains, CRRC has diversified its product categories to include semiconductors, new energy vehicles, new materials, offshore engineering products and industrial robots.
Hunan-based CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co Ltd, a subsidiary of CRRC, announced last week that it has developed a smart bus to tap lucrative urban transit markets in both the domestic and global markets.
A standard bus is about 30 meters long and equipped with sensors that can read the dimensions of roads and plan its own route, and a standard bus has three carriages with a capacity of 300 people.
It costs around 400 million yuan ($58 million) to 700 million yuan to build a kilometer of metro line. Such a bus costs up to 15 million yuan.",'% robot%'

By then, mass production of such vehicles may be a reality, they believe. That vision was included in the government's medium- and long-term development plan for automobiles, which aims to transform China into an innovative automotive nation.
Smart cars are a hit at the ongoing Shanghai Asian Consumer Electronics Show (CES), where science and technology companies gather to display products and ideas in areas such as the Internet of Things, 3-D printing, robotics and wearable devices.
With the inexorable growth of international cooperation, insiders say the auto industry faces significant changes. On May 31, German technology company Continental signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Baidu, with the goal of establishing a comprehensive strategic cooperation in the areas of automated driving, connected vehicles and intelligent mobility services.
Elmar Degenhart, Continental’s chief executive, said collaboration with Baidu would enable his company to work on core technologies like batteries, machinery and electronic controls.
On June 1, German auto supplier Bosch announced a plan to team up with Baidu to strengthen cooperation on intelligent transportation. Dirk Hoheisel, a member of Bosch’s management board, said the two companies will make full use of their technologies and experience in order to promote smart mobility.
On the same day, China’s Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC Group) and Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group (JAC Motor) signed a cooperative agreement with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG. Volkswagen AG and JAC Motor announced that they will set up a joint venture to produce electric vehicles.

A Top Ten Black Technologies list has been released at the 2017 China International Big Data Expo in Guiyang, capital of Southwest China's Guizhou province, stating how innovating the data industry helped to build a stronger, more intelligent life.
Ma Fang, senior media relations manager of Shenzhen-based Royole Corporation, said the structure and 0.01 micrometers of flexible display, seen at the event, can be applied to mobile phones, tablets, personal computers, smart home devices and intelligent transportation systems.
Much like the model, the flexible keyboard, released and featured at the event last year, was transparent, light and thin. It could expand and downsize into a stick no larger than a pen, which was easy for journalists to write stories everywhere, Ma said.
""The mobile phone, which can be worn on the wrist, was also released in the United States in January,"" she said.
""The display will go into production by the end of 2017, and has an estimated annual output of 20 billion yuan.""
Ma added the company, Shenzhen-based Royole Corporation, recently signed a cooperation memorandum with China Southern Airlines and Shenzhen Bus, as an application of flexible materials in the aviation and automobile industries.
""There will be no buttons on the operating desk because orders of playing music, guiding roads or air conditioning can be given through touch control,"" she said.
Wang Hongan, software researcher of the China Academy of Sciences, added the black technology referred to innovative high technology, which was developed generally beyond common sense, and said it would potentially overturn the whole industry.
""The 3D commodity show of the JD Group was enrolled in due to the application of the augmented reality technology in its e-commerce platform,"" he said.
According to Zhao Gang, leader of visual and augmented reality business of JD, the image of a rice cooker could also be put into real-life circumstances, in order to see if a chosen color and size would suit a specific kitchen.
""Some online shop owners may beautify products, but the 3D technology can even help customers to its inside; which, thus, helps them to make decisions,"" he said.
Sun Xuhong, director of central air conditioner of Haier, said a driverless unmanned air conditioner, from the Haier Group, had also been significantly developed to detect the temperature of nearby people and could adjust itself.
""The unmanned control system, called Haier intelligent cloud, can design different operating process for companies due to the mass data collected from various industries,"" he said.
A big data service start-up in China, named Hydata, also developed lip-reading recognition technology, which featured a 70 percent accuracy rate for the Chinese language. It also had an 80 percent accuracy rate for the English language, and was on the way of industrialization, with public security departments, in some provinces.

During his official visit to Germany, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang described the two countries as a golden pair in the manufacturing industry.
China is willing to promote ""the alignment between 'Made in China 2025' plan and Germany's 'Industry 4.0' concept,"" Li said, stressing collaboration in manufacturing, energy, aviation, innovation, and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Unveiled in 2015, the Made in China 2025 plan aims to transform China into an innovative manufacturing country. The German Industry 4.0 concept, coined in 2011, is designed to facilitate automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, including cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things and cloud computing.
Li's words were echoed by his German counterpart Angela Merkel who said Germany is ready to work with China to build a platform to synergize innovation and high-tech development strategies.
The meeting marked the next step in the world's second and fourth largest economies jointly exploring innovation as a means to stimulate flagging global growth.
""The two countries, although in different stages of development, can create mutual benefits via cooperation in the manufacturing industry and industrial digitalization,"" said Yao Ling, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation of the Ministry of Commerce.
At Hanover Fair, one of the world's largest trade fairs for industrial technology, held in April, China became the second largest exhibiting nation after the host Germany, with around 1,200 participating businesses.
Leading Chinese tech and manufacturing firms, including telecom giant Huawei and home appliance producer Haier, showcased their latest products and looked for deals and partners during the exhibition.
Chinese Internet giant Baidu this week inked agreements with German automotive suppliers Bosch and Continental AG to expand cooperation on self-driving technologies and vehicles, smart transport systems and Internet of Vehicles.
Successful corporate cooperation projects between the two countries are numerous, such as China's Baosteel and Germany's Siemens jointly participating in Industry 4.0 steel industry projects, the smart washing machine plant developed by China's Haier and Germany's Fraunhofer Institute, and Midea Group's takeover of German robot maker Kuka earlier this year.
Liu Yingkui from China Council for the Promotion of International Trade expects more Chinese investment in Germany and improved cooperation on research and development to push forward economic and technological ties.
China and Germany are already significant trade partners. Germany is one of a handful of countries that have a trade surplus with China with their transport equipment, chemicals, watches and machinery components popular in the Chinese market. Bilateral trade totaled 151.29 billion U.S. dollars over the last year, slightly down 3.5 percent year on year.
Two way investment was robust. China pumped over 2.95 billion U.S. dollars into Germany in 2016, a 258.6-percent increase from a year ago. In the same year, Germany invested in 392 projects in China with an investment volume of 2.71 billion U.S. dollars.

Four nuclear emergency response robots, jointly designed by China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) and the Institute of Optics and Electronics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, have been serving at Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in southern China’s Guangdong province since last November.
The four robots are responsible for both land and underwater missions, including salvaging and observations.
According to Feng Chang, a leader of the research and development team for the robots, they are able to withstand temperatures of up to 65 degrees Celsius and nuclear radiation at up to 10,000 Sv per hour. They are not only built from radiation-resistant material, each robot’s structure is carefully planned to ensure that it is radiation-proof as a whole.
Each robot is equipped with the best radiation-resistant camera in the world. In a work environment with nuclear radiation of 10,000 Sv per hour, the robots can still send images at 600 lines per inch.
“Ordinary robots, built with metal or rubber covers, easily burn under strong nuclear radiation. Their digital transmission devices stop working, and even the lenses of their cameras turn black,” Feng told Science and Technology Daily.
“The heaviest robot in a set of four is about 100 kilograms. In the case of a nuclear accident, all four robots could be packed and delivered in a single container,” Feng explained, adding that the robots can also play an important role in the daily maintenance of nuclear power plants.",'% robot%'

He unplugged the charger from the white-green hatchback and hung it on the charging pile, before driving to his office 12 km away. It was the fourth time Feng had used the car in a month.
The ultra small plug-in car was a rental that Feng booked online, one of 220 EvCard electric vehicles (EVs) lined up at the Hongqiao hub, near a high-speed railway station and two airport terminals.
""I don't have to queue up for a taxi or jam myself into a subway coach,"" said Feng, 31, who runs a small business in one of China's most expensive cities. ""I don't have a car, but it's getting easier to book one on an app and is usually cheaper than hailing a taxi.""
GREENER
Five minutes after Feng pulled out with the Roewe e50, a Chery EQ filled its parking slot.
Lu Liuxi got out of the minicar, connected the charger and scanned a sensor on the windshield with his smartphone before hearing a beep.
""It's available now,"" said Lu, an EvCard employee whose job is to move cars between parking stations as instructed by a dispatch center.
""Hongqiao is the busiest place among all EvCard stations in Shanghai, and we send cars here many times a day,"" said the veteran driver, who has been employed by EvCard for three months.
Launched in 2015 by Shanghai International Auto City (SIAC) Group, EvCard is China's first EV rental service, deploying 3,000 stations and about 6,000 cars in Shanghai. It also serves a further 23 Chinese cities.
The rate is 15 yuan for the first 30 minutes, with each minute a further 0.6 yuan in town, and 0.5 yuan out of town. The daily rent ceiling is 219 yuan for choices such as the Roewe e50 or Chery EQ. A BMW i3, a more upscale vehicle, costs more.
On Wednesday, the State Council announced efforts to develop the sharing economy, amid efforts to boost innovation and entrepreneurship.
Rong Wenwei, chair of the SIAC board, said that when the idea of EV rental first came to China, a number large vehicle rental firms were interested but dragged their feet due to uncertainty over profitability. The state-funded SIAC, however, had no such hesitation.
""In such a metropolis, each step to make the streets less choked and the air less polluted is worth taking,"" said Zhu Jing, who is in charge of the EvCard business unit.
The effort is paying off. EvCard now leads the world's green car rental service with the most EVs, self-service rental spots and membership clients, and is set to make a profit in Shanghai in 2018. By 2020, it plans to build a fleet of more than 300,000 cars to serve in 100 Chinese cities.
""It isn't impossible that cities like Shanghai will see car numbers drop,"" Zhu said.
His words were echoed by Zhu Xichan, professor at the School of Automotive Studies at Tongji University in Shanghai.
""The car has turned from a luxury to a household item in China. Limited resources and roads make car sharing the most convenient transport solution,"" he said.
""The idea of sharing, plus new energy vehicles, may well be an answer to private transportation while the number of cars can also be reduced,"" he said.
Recent statistics are encouraging. DriveNow, a car sharing service launched in 2011 in Germany, has pulled down private car use in Munich by 25 percent in past years, according to German reports.
While Los Angeles is estimated to remove 1,000 private vehicles off the road, a Paris-based firm is partnering with the Los Angeles Department of Transportation to supply 200 EVs and 100 chargers on various streets.
BETTER CONNECTED
""A total of 121,425 EVs have been registered in Shanghai, almost doubling the number 12 months ago,"" said Ding Xiaohua, deputy director of Shanghai's EV Public Data Collecting, Monitoring and Research Center (EvData), also affiliated to SIAC.
""All those EVs are being monitored here -- the entire EvCard fleet as well as all privately-owned and public ones like electric buses and sanitation vehicles,"" Ding said in front of a congested e-map of the downtown on a huge screen in an EvData monitoring room in Jiading, a municipal district where the SIAC is headquartered.
When the center was set up in 2012, he recalled, data came from only eight cars, all hand-recorded. Now the platform is the world's biggest in terms of database size, the number of involved automakers, models of cars and total mileage.
A car's location, speed, battery capacity, voltage and temperature can each renewed in just 30 seconds.
While big data can be used for driving behavioral studies and car performance evaluation, accidents can be alerted and prevented when certain parameters of cars go abnormal, Ding said.
China has an ""obvious strategic vision"" in EVs and clean energy transport, said Professor Roger Raufer of energy, resources and environment at the Hopkins-Nanjing Center.
""Although it is first driven by its own domestic needs for better air quality and fewer oil imports, China's sheer scale and global aspirations make it a tremendously formidable player on the international scene,"" said Raufer, a former advisor to the UN Division for Sustainable Development in New York.
In 2016, over 507,000 EVs were sold in China, more than the combined sales in the United States, Norway, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands.
Shanghai now has 10 percent of China's green cars.
As more EVs hit the road, there is a growing need to make them safer, smarter and more linked.
An enclosed test zone for connected and self-driving cars in Jiading is where many Chinese and foreign intelligent cars are tested before being mass manufactured.
Known as the F-Zone, the site is considered the best in China and is one of the most advanced in the world.
Connected cars are put through as many as 50 simulation programs, such as pedestrian and non-motor vehicle crossing alerts, intersection collision avoidance and collaborative highway fleets.
Automated driving tests include collision avoidance, exiting systems under dangerous conditions and response ability.
The zone is blueprinted to reach beyond an enclosed area for real road tests and offer more simulations, such as in different weather conditions, said Gu Leiming, from SIAC management, who supervises the F-Zone.
Experts including Li Keqiang, professor of the Department of Automotive Engineering at Tsinghua University, believe that after new energy cars, intelligent connected vehicles will be the next in the auto industry.
China has been the world's largest auto market for years.
China's home-grown auto makers have gained a one-third share of the domestic market, 28 million vehicles in 2016, turning themselves from imitators to initiators in research and development.
With a huge and robust market, an ever stronger information industry, innovative industrial policies and the self-developed BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, China might have an edge on competitors in developing intelligent connected vehicles, Li said.
MORE INNOVATIVE
In 2015, China announced the ""Made in China 2025"" initiative, focusing on promoting high-end manufacturing, with energy saving and new energy vehicles being one of the key points.
By 2020, Shanghai is set to work on about 60 major industrial projects, each worth over 1 billion yuan. The development of intelligent connected vehicles is on the list.
Efficient governance, advanced technologies and a large group of consumers eager to enter the connected era may give China ""the lead in the worldwide race to build connected cars and future transport system,"" according to a report by the Swedish trade and investment council in December 2016.
However, China's road to future cars is not without bumps.
Many argue that the soaring number of new energy cars is the result of government subsidies, and quite a number of drivers still prefer going to gas stations after buying plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs).
""If that is indeed the case complying with our data collection, measures should be taken and the car owner's credit rating should be affected,"" EvData's Ding said.
Ding appreciates that use of personal data may be a concern to some.
""While using data for future decision making on traffic optimization, we set collecting points on main roads instead of tracing individual vehicle movements too close to specific residential spots,"" he said.
Meanwhile, experts say that car rental can also be more scientific and friendly if it uses a ""handshake"" feature, allowing a vehicle to be transferred between two customers on the fly, which saves time looking for a parking place.
As for maintenance of shared vehicles, EvCard is introducing an appraisal system in which each clients can grade previous users, resulting in a reference for members' credit ratings.
Most experts remain positive about the future of EVs.
""The world needs a better way for people and goods to get around, and we believe autonomous, connected vehicles are an important component of the solution,"" Mark Schlissel, president of the University of Michigan, said as he signed with a Chinese firm representative an investment deal in October 2016 to advance autonomous, connected vehicles and robotic technologies.
David Frey, a partner for Markets Strategy at KPMG in China, said that each company recognized the unwavering commitment of the Chinese government to developing advanced new energy automobile manufacturing.
""We can expect that city-based experimentation with the infrastructure and business models required to support expansion of electric vehicles will be robust,"" Frey wrote in the latest issue of Insight, the journal of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.",'% robot%'

It's the series' strongest midnight opening in China yet, nearly doubling that of “Transformers: Age of Extinction.”
“Transformers: The Last Knight”sells big in China, but underwhelms with North American audiences.

(Xinhua) 18:46, June 21, 2017
HORGOS, Xinjiang, June 21 -- Despite Ramadan, saleswoman Guliman has seen many customers at the fur apparel store where she works in Horgos, a port bordering Kazakhstan in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
The store has been short-staffed lately and is recruiting shopping guides who speak Kazakh or Russian.
""We have had more customers from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Russia recently. They like fur a lot,"" said the 28-year-old, who is from a nearby county and is ethnically Kazakh.
Guliman makes around 5,000 yuan (730 U.S. dollars) a month depending on her sales performance. It is much higher than she could make at her old job, sitting at an office at a local housing institution.
The marten coats, produced in northern China's Tianjin City, cost 8,000 to 10,000 yuan each at the store. Monthly sales revenue can reach 800,000 yuan.
The store, Aliu International, is located at the China-Kazakhstan International Border Cooperation Center, the world's only duty-free shopping center spanning two countries, which opened in 2012.
People from both countries are welcome to shop at the 5.28-square-km center without a visa.
As a port, Horgos, which means ""a place where caravans pass"" in Mongolian, dates back more than 130 years.
While Horgos lost its shine as caravans faded into history, the Belt and Road Initiative, proposed by China in 2013, has revitalized the old port.
DAILY CROSSINGS
On a June afternoon in a parking lot on the Chinese side, foreign buyers swarmed out of shopping buildings, loaded their purchases into cars and headed home across the border. Guldan, 46, was among them.
Guldan is from Zharkent, a town in Kazakhstan some 40 km away from Horgos. She visits the center every day, along with her two siblings, and their driver, buying children's goods worth approximately 5,000 yuan each time.
At the center, each person is allowed to purchase up to 8,000 yuan in duty-free goods each day.
""My husband runs a baby store at home, so we come here every day to refill our stock. China-made products are very popular for both price and quality,"" said Guldan, while packing strollers, bicycles and beds for children into cars.
Seric, 34, also from Zharkent, sells small goods at a duty-free building at the center. Working at Horgos, he is able to go home every day. When he worked in the Kazakh capital Astana, 1,600 km away, he only returned home once a year.
""Although I'm in Horgos, I just feel like I'm working at home,"" he said. ""My neighbors are jealous and often ask me when the companies here will offer more jobs.""
According to the border control station in Horgos, more than 5 million Chinese and foreigners crossed the border last year via the Horgos cooperation center, accounting for 70 percent of total entries and exits in Xinjiang.
Cargo trains from the Chinese cities of Chongqing and Zhengzhou pass through the port on their way to Europe. Earlier this month, a new passenger train route was launched via Horgos, which reduces travel time by eight hours between Urumqi, Xinjiang's regional capital, and Almaty in Kazakhstan, compared to the old route via the Alataw Pass.
Wang Gang, Party chief of Horgos, said the number of service cashier windows at the industrial and commercial registration center has risen from five in 2014 to 20 now.
Thirty new businesses are registered every day on average in Horgos, which was inaugurated as a city in 2014. They are attracted by preferential policies, a simpler registration process and a five-year exemption on business taxes.
""These businesses will bring tens of thousands of jobs as well as consumption,"" he said.
The economy of the city expanded 40 percent to 2.68 billion yuan, and the revenue budget rocketed up 278 percent year on year to 1.32 billion yuan in 2016.
Boshihao Group, a Shenzhen-registered firm that develops and produces robots, smartphones and tablet computers, opened a factory in Horgos in May.
The factory will meet demand from the Russian and Central Asian markets, according to its general manager, Min Jianbo.
""A shorter delivery time to these countries and preferential tax policies are major reasons that we have chosen to locate our factory here,"" he said.
Saleswoman Guliman studied software engineering in Beijing after graduating from university in 2012. She is confident that her academic achievements will be put to use somehow in Horgos as part of the Belt and Road Initiative.
""I'm sure I'll find a job here related to my major someday, maybe when the high-tech companies decide to localize their technical personnel,"" she said.",'% robot%'

Internet powerhouse Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has appointed a seasoned scientist at Amazon.com Inc to spearhead its efforts in artificial intelligence, a move that will propel its so-called ""NASA plan"" to double up on technology research.
Alibaba in March announced a major project at its first technical meeting in Hangzhou, to galvanize the group's technological capabilities, code-named NASA.
Since June, Ren Xiaofeng, former senior principal scientist at Amazon and a Chinese citizen, has taken on the role as chief scientist and deputy dean at Alibaba's Institute of Data Science and Technologies, its global research and development center, the company confirmed on Monday.
Ren is recruiting a world-class computer vision team at a fast-expanding site in Bellevue, in the United States.
That's according to Ren's updated resume on the website of the University of Washington, where he also serves as an affiliate assistant professor of computer science and engineering.
In his four years at Amazon, Ren was the lead scientist at Amazon Go, using computer vision and machine learning, to transform retailing. The research led to the launch of an automatic check-out system that eliminates unnecessary and annoying customer waiting.
Prior to Amazon, Ren also had deep experience in vision-related projects at Intel Lab, working on computer vision and its applications in activity recognition and monitoring, robotics, and human-computer interaction. Ren holds a PhD in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley.
Alibaba said that Ren's coming onboard indicated an accelerated pace to carry out the NASA project, proposed by founder Jack Ma in March, to boost the firm's technological capacity in 20 years.
Ma said at the time that to meet the group's strategic goal of serving 2 billion customers, creating 100 million jobs and enabling 10 million businesses to become profitable, Alibaba should invest in technological infrastructure featuring machine learning, chips, the internet of things and biometric identification, among others.
As a new entrant to the international cloud market, Alibaba is off to a good start, being included for the first time in a Gartner Inc report this month as being ""well-positioned to take on bigger players such as Amazon and Microsoft Corp"".
Since the start of the year China's tech majors have been plowing in billions of dollars into consolidating a technical arsenal and talent pool to outgun their rivals.
Search engine Baidu Inc hired former Microsoft executive Lu Qi as group president and rolled out its Apollo Project to help drive the development of autonomous cars.
Tencent Holdings Ltd is also betting on cloud technologies and AI, doubling its offshore data centers this year and identifying AI as being synonymous with its services.

The news that Baidu will participate in a citywide trial of autonomous vehicles signals the latest move in the internet giant's plans to become a major player in the burgeoning market.
Under a five-year agreement between China's biggest search engine and the city of Wuhu in the eastern province of Anhui, the company's autonomous cars, buses and vans will gradually be introduced to selected roads and zones before eventually being allowed to use public highways throughout the city. The vehicles will not carry passengers during the first three years of the trial period.
The agreement has seen Baidu potentially steal a march on its rivals in the sector, which was kick-started by Google's self-driving-car program in 2009. Since then, automobile manufacturers such as BMW, Volvo and Toyota have all become leading lights in the race to commercialize so-called robocars.
Now, as basic self-driving technologies become more mature, companies in the world's largest auto market are anxious to deepen their involvement in the sector.
""Currently, the major bottlenecks in replacing human drivers with robots lie in cost reductions, the upgrading of the transportation infrastructure and legal issues. China, which has a large automobile market and higher acceptance of self-driving technology, will have a competitive advantage,"" said Jack Yu, general manager of ResearchInChina, an auto industry consultancy in Beijing.
The race is just starting. Ahead of the Beijing Auto Show, which ran from April 25 to May 4, Chang'an Automobile sent two driverless cars on a six-day, 2,000-kilometer test journey from Chongqing in the southwest to the Chinese capital in the north.
In early April, the Swedish carmaker Volvo, which is owned by Zhejiang Geely Holdings?headquartered in Hangzhou, in the province of Zhejiang in East China?announced a plan to launch a self-driving experiment involving as many as 100 cars.
Chinese tech giants, such as Baidu and LeAuto?a subsidiary of Leshi Internet Information &Technology?are also engaged in self-driving technologies. Baidu started a research program in July 2014, and undertook its first fully automatic road test in December, while LeAuto unveiled the LeSEE, its concept driverless vehicle, on April 20.
""Worldwide, self-driving technologies are becoming mature. I'm optimistic that it will only be five years or so before we will be able to buy self-driving cars,"" Yu said.
The timeline accords with the plans of the major players: Google, Toyota, General Motors, and Nissan have all disclosed plans to put self-driving cars in the market by 2020.",'% robot%'

A robot is being designed to compete with 12th graders during the college entrance examination in 2017 and get a score qualifying it to enter first-class universities in China, according to Huaxi Metropolis Daily.
The robot will sit three exams, namely math, Chinese and a comprehensive test of liberal arts, which includes history, politics and geography, said Lin Hui, CEO of an artificial intelligence company in Chengdu. The company won the bid for the artificial intelligence program on the robot's math test from the Ministry of Science and Technology in 2015.
Like the other examinees, the robot will have to finish the exams during designated periods. Unlike the usual scene that sees 30 students sit in an exam room, the robot will take its exams in a closed room without anyone else present, except for proctors and a notary.
According to Lin, the robot will be linked to a printer before every exam, and the electronic examination paper will be put into the robot's program when the examination begins. The robot will be totally disconnected from the internet and will solve the problems with its artificial intelligence program. Finally the answers will be outputted through the printer.
It's believed that Chinese and a comprehensive test of liberal arts, rather than maths, will pose challenges to the robot, since questions in maths are objective with specific answers, while in the other test subjects, there are some subjective questions, such as the reading comprehension and essay-writing.
Lin said that the robot writing technique nowadays has been increasingly mature. With key information words, a robot can write an economic news report following the widely-accepted writing mode in Silicon Valley, while nobody could tell it was written by a robot, Li said.
From this point of view, the robot can analyze the topic of the writing session and complete writing. Though the essay may turn out to be an emotionless piece, that slightly affects the grade.
The robot is actually a touchstone for artificial intelligence development and the key technology of the robot lies in understanding language and reasoning, according to Fu Hongguang, who is in charge of the research and development of the artificial intelligence program required in the math test.
The robot is reportedly trying to qualify for admission to Peking University and Tsinghua University in 2020, and its counterpart in Japan is eyeing Tokyo University in 2020.

You see them in warehouses, in hospitals, on the street and in restaurants. The robotics industry, therefore, has become a hot field for investment.
Market research company IDC predicts in its Worldwide Commercial Robotics Spending Guide that the compound annual growth rate of the robotics industry will be 17 percent, and that the industry will reach a net worth of 135.4 billion dollars by 2019. The robotics industry boom is taking place mainly in Asia, with China and Japan responsible for 69 percent of total consumption on robots.
One of the main indicators for the industry’s building prosperity is that venture investment capital on robots hit 587 million dollars in 2015, which is twice the amount in 2014. In addition, the number of patent applications has been soaring in the past decade. Last year, China took 35 percent of the total robotics-related patent application around the world.
Whether the robotics revolution will arrive in full still depends on innovative companies making strides in manufacturing. Currently, the industry features mostly high-cost traditional manufacturing. Instead, companies should be focusing on making low-cost machines with specific tasks, according to Financial Times. Another key to developing the robotics business is to focus on equipping robots with basic learning ability, so as to accelerate their improvement.

The phrase ‘I only have two hands’ is no longer an excuse with a new human-machine hybrid.
Researchers have unveiled a wrist-worn joint device that transforms into extra fingers, allowing the wearer to carryout ‘tri-manual tasks’.
Strong enough to lift a bucket, this gripper-like robot consists of 11 motors linked together using LEGO parts - each one designed with 180 degrees of motion range.
The team used electromyography (EGM) signals from a MYO armband sensor worn around the arm, which is a gesture control wearable that tracks motion and muscle. It can work as a second hand to help the wearer perform multiple tasks at once, such as opening and unlocking a door simultaneously
This high-tech ‘hand’ was developed by the researchers at MIT who based the designs on a few different factors such as not interfering with the user’s own human abilities and it should be able to disengage from the user’s context without enforcing continuous use of it.
Cables connect to an armband sensor and also to a computer-based controller.
‘The physical design of our joints device is created to maximize the rendering capability for various form factors, while maintaining a quasi-anthropomorphic setup so that a range of physical tasks can be performed, reads the recently published study.
‘Therefore, our final design consists of two finger-shaped segments, each with 4 pitch servos, and one yaw servo, mounted on a bigger base servo that adjusts the angular position of the entire device.’
Servo, or servomechanism, is a device that uses error-sensing negative feeds back to improve the performance of a mechanism.
The base servo can be attached to different areas of the arm: on the forearm, wrist, or parallel or perpendicular to the arm.
And each position performs different set of functions.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- With a specialized non-invasive brain cap, millions of people who are paralyzed or have neurodegenerative diseases may have a chance to control a robotic arm with their minds, according to a study released Wednesday.
Researchers at the University of Minnesota, including three Chinese scientists, have made a breakthrough recently: When research subjects put on a specialized non-invasive brain cap, they were able to move a robotic arm by simply imagining moving their own arms.
""This is the first time in the world that people can operate a robotic arm to reach and grasp objects in a complex 3D environment using only their thoughts without a brain implant,"" said one of the Chinese researchers Bin He, director of Institute for Engineering in Medicine at the University of Minnesota.
""Just by imagining moving their arms, they were able to move the robotic arm,"" He said Wednesday in a news release.
The non-invasive technique, named electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface, records tiny electrical activities produced by neurons in the subjects' brain through a specialized, high-tech EEG cap fitted with 64 electrodes and converts the ""thoughts"" into action by advanced signal processing and machine learning.
Eight out of 13 healthy human subjects completed all the 15 experimental sessions of the study wearing the cap. Subjects gradually learned to imagine moving their own arms without actually moving them, to control a robotic arm to complete reach and automatic grasp tasks in three dimensions.
""Each subject began with virtual cursor control and progressed to robotic arm control with increasing complexity and dimensionality over time,"" said the study published in a Nature research journal named Scientific Reports.
Starting from reaching and grasping objects in fixed locations on a table, the subjects were then able to move the robotic arm to reach and grasp objects in random locations on a table, and finally to move objects from the table to a three-layer shelf by only thinking about these movements.@ ""Most subjects exhibited improved performance over time in controlling both the virtual cursor and the robotic arm,"" the study said. All eight subjects could move a robotic arm to pick up objects in fixed locations with an average success rate above 80 percent and move objects from the table onto the shelf with an average success rate above 70 percent.
""This is exciting as all subjects accomplished the tasks using a completely non-invasive technique. We see a big potential for this research to help people who are paralyzed or have neurodegenerative diseases to become more independent without a need for surgical implants,"" He said.
The next step would be a further development of this technology to realize a brain-controlled robotic prosthetic limb attached to one's body or examine how this technology could work with someone who has had a stroke or is paralyzed, He said.",'% robot%'

China joined the WTO as its 143rd member on Dec. 11, 2001. Since then, the country has grown into the world's second-largest economy and largest trading country, while millions of Chinese have been lifted out of poverty.
Changes for the Chinese include buying cheaper cars, enjoying international products and traveling more.
""China's WTO entry has brought benefits not only to the country's people, but also for the rest of the world,"" said Lei Da, economics professor at Renmin University of China.
China has long been vital in helping shore up world economic growth, especially in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Despite slower growth in recent years, China's economy still contributes 25 percent of the world's growth.
As the vast Chinese market has grown, countries as diverse as Zambia, Australia, Brazil and the United States have seen their exports to China soar.
It is clear that China's strong demand for imports has been a major stabilizing factor amid a sluggish world economy.
China's imports have surged from 243.55 billion U.S. dollars to 1.68 trillion dollars in 15 years, an average annual growth of 10.3 percent.
For many developing countries, no matter in Asia, Africa or Latin America, the Chinese market has been vital in ensuring growth and development stay on track.
China has also been ready to help poorer partners develop. As the world's second biggest investor, the country's outbound direct investment rose for a 13th straight year in 2015, reaching a record high of 145.67 billion dollars.
Dubbed the factory of the world, China manufactures everything from toys and shoes to bullet trains and industrial robots.
From 2001 to 2016, thanks to imported goods from China, consumers around the world saved billions of dollars. Quality yet inexpensive Chinese products contributed to an increase in consumer purchasing power and helped reduce worldwide poverty.
Companies that opened operations in China have profited. Foreign-invested industrial enterprises reported combined profits of about15 trillion yuan (around 2.2 trillion U.S. dollars) over the past 15 years.
Despite a tepid global recovery, the continuous growth of foreign investment in China shows that investors are upbeat about the country's business climate.

China’s underwater robot technology has advanced significantly in recent years, but the country still faces problems, including a lack of applicable products and relatively slow transformation process from technologies to applicable products, experts said.
In 2016, China’s underwater robot industry saw fast development. In January, the homegrown unmanned autonomous underwater vehicle Qianling-2 accomplished its first undersea mission, searching the seabed and collecting high-precision hydrological data.
In August, Haidou-1, China’s domestic underwater glider, dove over 10,767 meters below sea level, making China the third country after Japan and the U.S. to have built submersibles capable of reaching depths in excess of 10,000 meters.
Though China’s progress in underwater robot technology has been recognized by the international community, the country still lags behind compared to many developed nations. It is time-consuming to transform technologies into actual products, and China still has a long way to go to establish a mature industrial system.
“In the U.S., an underwater robot can be tested hundreds of times per year, while in China we can only test the robot dozens of times [due to the slow process of technological transformation]. In the long run, China will fall even further behind,” Liu Jian, chief designer of Qianling-2, told Economic Information Daily.
Feng Xisheng, an academic at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out that China needs to build a system covering the research, design, manufacturing, application and talent training of underwater robots. While other countries have established distinct industrial sectors to develop such technologies, underwater robots in China are mainly studied at research centers, with few companies taking part in the process.

A larger probe also will set off for Mars around 2030 to take samples and return to Earth, he said.
The conference was held by the State Council Information Office to issue the China's Space Activities in 2016 white paper, which reviews progress made in 2016 and discloses major tasks for the next five years.
Jupiter as well as its moons will be visited by at least one unmanned probe from China before 2030, Wu said.
Illustrations show the country's first Mars probe consisting of three parts — an orbiter, lander and rover. The rover will have six wheels and four solar panels.
The probe is expected to take nearly seven months before reaching the red planet, said Zhang Rongqiao, chief scientist of China's Mars exploration program.
The rover will carry 13 scientific instruments, weigh about 200 kilograms and work 92 days on the planet, according to Sun Zezhou, chief designer of the probe.
Wu also said Tuesday that the Chang'e 5 lunar probe will be sent to the moon by the end of 2017 to take samples and return to Earth. In 2018, Chang'e 4 will carry out the world's first soft landing — using rockets to slow descent — on the far side of the moon.
China has launched three robotic lunar exploration missions, including one that soft-landed a rover on the moon.
To realize China's grand aspirations, scientists have started to design a super-heavy rocket, the Long March 9, and plan to put it to use around 2030, Wu said.",'% robot%'

Kentucky Fried Chicken launched its first artificial intelligence-enabled store in Beijing on Friday, and the fast-food chain said it plans to further expand its layout of smart restaurants, creating more innovative and interesting dining experiences for customers.
With the cooperation of Baidu Inc, China's largest search engine, KFC started its first smart restaurant in the Financial Street area in Beijing.
At the store, customers are able to take pictures with a machine, which will recognize the diner's face, sex, age, mood and other features, then help to recommend suitable food and set meals and complete the ordering process.
""If the consumer visits the store again and takes a picture with the machine, it will be able to recognize his or her face and show the previous purchase history, remember the customer's dining habits, and help to place an order faster,"" said Wu Zhongqin, deputy director of the Institute of Deep Learning of Baidu Inc, which helped to develop the technology.
With another machine with an augmented reality, or AR function, customers are able to interact with the machine, change facial expressions by shaking their heads in front of the machine, take photos, and save them to their phones.
In April, KFC, an affiliate of Yum China Holdings Inc, started its first Chinese smart restaurant in Shanghai. The outlet is equipped with intelligent robot ordering, debuting the use of artificial intelligence in chain restaurants.
Zhao Li, general manager of Beijing KFC, said smart restaurants are not only about the cool hardware, but more about providing convenience to consumers.
""Our innovations make use of the cutting-edge technologies and they will help to attract more young consumers who prefer fashionable new things. The digitalization of the restaurant will also help to provide faster and easier services,"" she said.

AlphaGo, the AI player of the Go board game, hit the headlines again recently by achieving 60 straight online victories over more than 5o of Asia's top Go players.
AlphaGo, under the username ""Master,"" has defeated 59 world-class Go players on online Go platforms since December 29, 2016, including players from China, Japan and South Korea, such as Ke Jie, Yuta Iyama and Park Jeong-hwan. ""Master"" revealed that it is an AI on January 4, before a match with world-class Chinese player Gu Li in which it easily achieved its 60th victory.
""Thanks for the shock AlphaGo brought to the game of Go ... though I knew the identity of Master from the beginning, I still strongly wished that a human could win when watching the games,"" Ke Jie wrote on his Sina Weibo account on January 4.
Man behind the machine
Aja Huang, senior research scientist at Google DeepMind and the lead programmer of AlphaGo, was the one who moved the game pieces for AlphaGo during the matches.
His computer science and information engineering master's tutor at National Taiwan Normal University, Lin Shun-Shii, told the Global Times about Huang and AlphaGo on Thursday.
Huang started to learn Go when he was a child and continued playing into adulthood, which helped him develop AlphaGo, said Lin.
In around 2004, Huang began to develop a Go AI named after his wife Erica. Huang observed other similar programs and often discussed how to improve the Erica AI with Lin.
At the beginning, at competitions which pit Go programs against each other, Erica was an average player, but after gradual improvements, Erica became one of the best programs at the time and won Huang a gold medal at a Japanese competition.
Today, AlphaGo is still using some of the technologies pioneered in Erica.
Lin told the Global Times that AlphaGo was upgraded after playing historic matches against some top Go players in March 2016, when it was ""not so good sometimes.""
However, the AI won all 60 matches this time, which ""never happened in history.""
""No other program but AlphaGo could win 60 matches, so DeepMind, the developer, admitted that 'Master' was AlphaGo,"" Lin noted.
""Now that our unofficial testing is complete, we're looking forward to playing some official, full-length games later this year in collaboration with Go organizations and experts, to explore the profound mysteries of the game further in this spirit of mutual enlightenment,"" DeepMind announced on January 4.
Humans besting humans
Nowadays, with the rapid development of AI, people have mixed feelings about the technology - both hopes and fears.
Lin believed that ""it is an inevitable trend that humans cannot beat computers anymore.""
Our computer systems have become smarter and more powerful, and if the computers are better than you at the most advanced decisions, just let them do it, Lin said. ""You cannot help it.""
""This is a victory for human beings, not for machines,"" said Yu Kai, founder of the Institute of Deep Learning at Baidu Inc and CEO of Horizon Robotics, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
Yu also argues that as the algorithms controlling machines are created by humans, so if their orders are changed, the machines cannot win.
Yu believed that AI could become partners to humans and be used for production, education, medicine and transportation. The development of AI technology does not aim to replace mankind's with machines, but to extend human's abilities, he says. ""Technologies could help humans in the areas that we are not good at.""
When an AI surpasses humans in some areas, it is actually human beings surpassing themselves, said Wang Yuefei, chief of the Beijing-based State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, according to Xinhua.
""How could we benefit more people with these advances is the question that we should consider the most,"" Wang noted.

The imitator kept bowing and apologizing to the visitors. This attracted lots of Chinese people to gather around.
This imitator is, obviously, mocking the attitude of Abe, who more than once openly refuses to apologize for Japan's WWII and war crimes, driving tension between Japan and China.
Historical animosity has always been a major tension driver between China and Japan. Echoing the Abe robot in Shanghai, Japanese Oscar-winning animation director Hayao Miyazaki harshly criticized Abe's understanding in history on Monday. Miyazaki says that Japan should apologize and pay compensation.

The technical staff just sits at the computer and monitors through a central control system.
At the workshop of Changying Precision Technology Company in Dongguan, known as the ""world factory"", which manufactures cell phone modules, 60 robot arms at 10 production lines are polishing the modules day and night. Each line has an automatic belt and three workers who are just responsible for checking lines and monitoring.
A few months ago, it required 650 workers to finish this process. A robot arm can replace six to eight workers, now there are 60 workers and the number will be reduced to 20 in the future, according to Luo Weiqiang, general manager of the company.
This is the first step of the ""robot replace human"" program. In the next two years the number of robots will be increased to 1,000 and 80 percent process will be conducted by robots, said Chen Qixing, president of the company.
Compared with many skilled workers, these robots are new hands. But they made far more and better products than well-trained workers and experts. Data shows that since the robots came to the factory, the defect rate of products has dropped from over 25 percent to less than 5 percent and the production capacity from more than 8,000 pieces per person per month increased to 21,000 pieces.
This company is only a microcosm of Dongguan, one of the manufacturing hubs in China. The City plans to finish 1,000 to 1,500 ""robot replace human"" programs by 2016.
With the implementation of ""Made in China 2025"" strategy, a growing number of ""unmanned workshops or factories"" will come out.",'% robot%'

It has also attracted extreme interest in capital markets. CB Insights statistics show that in 2014, the growth rate of financing for UAV start-ups was more than 100%, reaching $ 108 million.
Although the word drone has a lot of different meanings-military craft, research tool, delivery robot-for the average civilian, drone means a high-tech toy. After all, a maximum of 15 minutes’ endurance is a mishap for most of the existing products.
In fact, the manufactures not only need to pay attention to the endurance of the battery and drone’s carrying capacity, but also the laws and regulations on UAVs.
In 2009, Civil Aviation Administration of China issued a regulation, in which, drones for civilian use should be included in the scope of general aviation. However most of civilian UAVs users do not know the relevant processes of flying a general aviation device.
On November 2013, Flight Standards Department of CAAC issued an interim provision on UAV aviators. According to the management, UAVs are divided into four types -- micro, light, small, and big. For those micro UAVs, which weighs less than seven kilograms, pilots do not need to have a license when flying one within a radius of 500 meters vision, at the relative height of less than 120 meters.",'% robot%'

But one new south China retail complex will offer just one thing: robots.
Government officials in Guangdong Province's Foshan City announced Friday that they will open a 20,000-square-meter-plus""robot supermarket"" in the city's Shunde District.
The first-of-its-kind center will open to the public in September. It will give robotics developers a place to exhibit and sell their latest models, as well as provide a platform for research and development and intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, said Xuan Ganhua, an official with the local robotics industry area in Shunde.
""It will incorporate robot sales and exhibitions as well as labs where industrial robots are designed, programmed and built,"" Xuan said, adding that robots at the center will serve different industrial sectors, including automobiles, furniture and machine tools.
An IPR protection court will also be located on the premises, Xuan added.
Officials have set the bar high for vendors, allowing only well-known brands to join. A total of 30 Chinese and foreign brands will have a presence during the initial phase.
""We have already chosen some companies from scores of applications, including German brand Kuka, and we are still in the selection process,"" said Lie Haijian, deputy district head of Shunde.
Shunde is a model area for robotics development in the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong. The district currently boasts more than20 robotics companies, with the number of robots produced growing30 percent annually.
The main complex of the center has been completed, and workers are decorating the interior, according to Xinhua reporters at the site.
ROBOTICS TO AUTOMATE JOBS
The role of industrial robots is growing in China as the country's manufacturing industry feels the pinch of a worker shortage and soaring labor costs.
Last year, some 56,000 industrial robots were sold in the Chinese market, up 54 percent annually. According to the International Federation of Robotics, China will have purchased400,000 industrial robots by 2017.
""The 'supermarket' will be conducive to development in the robotics industry in China because it will bring the world's latest technology into one platform,"" said Yang Yang, General Manager of Changsha Chaint Robotics Co., Ltd.
Despite growing demand, China's domestically produced robots still lag behind international producers. Last year, robots from domestic producers only accounted for 28.6 percent of the total sold on the Chinese market, and even robots classified as domestic rely on key imported components.
""The new 'supermarket' gives companies from home and abroad a chance to compete and learn from each other,"" said He Minjia, General Manager of GSK CNC Equipment Co., Ltd., a Guangzhou company focused on numerical control of machine tools.

He made the statement during an interview with Russian news agency RIA Novosti .
“The modernization of the shipyard’s capacity is actively underway to ensure the construction of advanced submarines. This process will provide a platform for the future construction of new-generation boats,” Budnichenko said.
He added that at the moment, the company buys new equipment and machinery, updates slipways, and reconstructs freight transfer systems.
“In line with the current federal program, the modernization should be completed by 2020,” he said.
Russia’s Navy chief, Adm. Viktor Chirkov, said in May that the development of fifth-generation submarines, featuring unified module platforms and integrated robotic weaponry, had already started in Russia.
Sevmash shipyard, the largest ship-building complex in Russia, is located in the port city of Severodvinsk on the White Sea.
Russia is currently undergoing a $325-billion rearmament program to achieve a 70-percent modernization of its military by 2020.
Sevmash shipyard has no problem with import substitution, as equipment and materials produced by “potential aggressors” are not used in the construction of nuclear-powered submarines, Budnichenko said.
The United States, the European Union and their allies imposed several rounds of sanctions aimed at weakening Russia's economy and specifically its defense industry in 2014. As a result, the construction of several ships has been suspended due to lack of engines that were to be supplied by Germany and Ukraine.
""Import substitution is not a problem for Sevmash. I think it is needless to say how risky it is in an age of almost unlimited capabilities of IT-technologies to equip submarines with materials and systems produced by ‘potential aggressors’,"" Budnichenko said.
He added that the use of only indigenously manufactured equipment and materials in construction of nuclear submarines has been a common practice in Russia since Soviet times.

Technology enthusiasts from around the world have been flocking to Huaqiangbei shopping center, where all kinds of electronic components are sold.
These ""makers,"" as they're known within a growing movement of do-it-yourself inventors, craftsmen, and tinkerers, turn their ideas into new devices, often with the help of 3D printers, robotics, and other advanced tools. For some, it is a full-time job, while others pursue their projects as a hobby.
Silvia Lindtner, a professor at the University of Michigan in the United States, said that at Huaqiangbei, makers can touch and feel different hardware components for inspiration and ideas.
Marcus Weyreuther, from Germany, has cooperated with Chinese partners to develop a thermometer that can measure temperature when connected to a smart phone. Thanks to the components sold at Huaqiangbei, Weyreuther's invention has gone from a design to a real product.
Huaqiangbei is just one spot in China's booming maker landscape. In addition to Shenzhen, the cities of Beijing and Shanghai have also become home to innovators and makers. Several maker communities such as Beijing Makerspace, Shanghai Xin Che Jian and Shenzhen Chaihuo Makerspace have formed in those cities.
During his visit to Chaihuo Makerspace earlier this month, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said people with creative ideas should receive help to set up their own businesses.
Industrial insiders said the maker movement is based on traditional manufacturing and driven by creativity, and China's booming manufacturing industry has created a solid foundation for maker culture.
Some companies are even turning to makers for cooperation. Foxconn Electronics, a Taiwan-funded supplier for Apple, has launched a factory, InnoConn, to manufacture products designed and invented by these innovators.
Leading household electrical appliances maker Haier Group has launched a maker laboratory to provide exhibition and exchange opportunities, project incubation and financial support for makers.
The innovation environment in China has also caught the eye of foreign maker projects. A hardware incubation project under the British venture capital firm SOSventure has set up an incubation center in Huaqiangbei, offering funds and guidance.
Despite the rapid development, makers in the country still have their complaints, since most Chinese factories are still using traditional production technology. Production costs are also comparatively high and the products usually have no price advantage when entering the market.
In order to overcome these obstacles, some makers have started their own businesses. The Shenzhen-based DJI Technology Co., Ltd., which specializes in producing unmanned aircraft, was founded by Wang Tao, who was a model plane enthusiast in college.
DJI has claimed over 50 percent of global market share in small unmanned aircraft, according to the company.
However, not all makers aspire to business success, and many just enjoy the process of creating. Ma Tianchi is dedicated to developing eyeglasses that can determine whether drivers are tired by recording their blinking rate.
As to his motivation, Ma said, ""I just love the feeling of turning ideas into reality and being helpful to others.""
He said being a maker is a way of life. ""It can push me to learn new things and help tap my creative potential. It has also taught me how to accept failures and to always keep trying,"" he said.
Zhang Guoxin, director of Shenzhen Weina integrated circuit and system application research institute, said it is hard to predict to what extent makers will influence economic development. However, they are creating a culture that can inspire learning and creativity.",'% robot%'

A craftsman has risen from a common bench worker to a microelectronic technology expert by studying in his spare time for 20 years, and innovated ground-breaking products conducive to petrochemical production.
""The psychological quality is very important. Your hands should maintain a same position and your mind a same rhythm by devoting yourself wholeheartedly into what you are doing,"" said Diao Kejian, as he shows how he makes a circuit board, the ""brain"" of his self-developed fire extinguishing and explosion proof intelligent robot (system), for petrochemical production.
Dressed in a grey work suit, the typical uniform of a blue-collar worker, he has developed six major world-class petrochemical equipment and systems in the last eight years, at a speed of one product in less than two years.
He is also in charge of the Information Application Research and Development Center of Fushun Petrochemical Engineering Construction Company subordinated to Petro China, in Fushun, Northeast China's Liaoning province, an old industrial base.
The fire extinguishing robot (system),his latest innovation, can detect sparks in workshops of a petrochemical factory and analyze whether the sparks will start a fire before extinguishing it. It is expected to get a certification next month and be available in market for about 100,000 yuan ($14,986).
In comparison, a similar but unintelligent foreign-made fire extinguishing system costs 400,000 yuan. Such huge price gap is because Diao hopes the advanced technology will also be used by the general public, which is sensitive to price, rather than only by big companies.
""Only when the technology is promoted and popularized in every part of the society can its value be fully realized and benefit all people,"" said Diao.
Achieving this goal is not easy. When he first developed the technology, the cost was very high. To lower it, Diao challenged himself by making many additional experiments until the cost dropped to a price range that satisfied him and that the civil use market can accept.
As the core technological difficulty of the fire extinguishing robot lies in its circuit board, every adjustment and improvement means making a new circuit board.",'% robot%'

Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been developing rapidly in China, according to experts and business leaders at an AI expo in Beijing. These authorities acknowledge that China has become a major AI power in the world, with speech recognition technology that tops that of any other nation.
Addressing the 2016 AI World Expo, which opened on Oct. 18 in Beijing, experts like Wang Feiyue, deputy director-general at the Chinese Association of Automation (CAA), and Yang Jing, founder of Beijing-based think tank AI Era, noted that China is becoming an increasingly prominent player in AI technology.
In 2016, two of the six fellows of the Association for the Advance of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) are overseas Chinese with foreign nationalities; another is a Chinese citizen. These numbers are especially dramatic given that the association has only made 15 Chinese people fellows since 1990, according to Yang.
At this year’s ImageNet - the Olympics of the IT world – the Chinese delegation came out on top in a variety of categories. The most prominent teams included those from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the No. 3 Research Institute Affiliated with the Ministry of Public Security and domestic IT company SenseTime, Yang added.
In the field of speech recognition, the software of Shenzhen-based company iFLYTEK boasted 95 percent accuracy, having won multiple championships at global speech synthesizer competitions, according to the company’s president, Liu Qingfeng. Liu also said that iFLYTEK’s software is now being used in BMW, Audi and Mercedes Benz vehicles worldwide.
“I believe that human-computer interaction platforms will be mainly controlled by vocals within the next 10 years, with assistive touch on screens or keypads. AI will enter everyday life as an essential along the lines of water and electricity,” Liu said at the expo.
Liu’s speech was broadcast in real-time on a screen using the company’s speech recognition software. Containing barely any mistakes, the transcription earned much admiration at the expo.
“We need Chinese people to get into this field both in technology and economy,” said Yoshua Bengio, head of the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, in a video clip sent to the expo.
“China holds a great advantage in its number of data pieces and user population, which can contribute greatly to AI development,” said Zheng Nanning, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering Sciences.
Zheng pointed out that AI development is especially crucial against the background of China’s ambition to become an innovative power by 2020, and a major science power by 2030. These goals are part of a strategic development guideline on innovative power that was issued by the central government in May.
(Yang Jing, founder of Beijing-based think tank AI Era, speaks at the expo.)
Stanford University’s leading AI scientist Fei-Fei Li predicted in a video clip sent to the expo that applications dependent upon perception, such as self-driving vehicles, industrial-use robots and augmented and virtual reality, will improve a great deal in the next five to 10 years. Li also thought that the industry’s focus would shift to cognitive AI.
At a sideline panel discussion about self-driving technology, IT giant Baidu announced that it would launch another road test of its self-driving car on the open road before the end of 2016, after a successful road test on a closed ring road in Beijing in 2015, according to James Peng, a chief architect working on Baidu’s self-driving initiative.
Peng admitted that a Level 4 road test, which lacks any human assistive control, will be especially hard in China, given the complex traffic condition that are complicated by jaywalking pedestrians and overly aggressive drivers.
Nevertheless, Peng boasted that Baidu’s self-driving car has 95 percent accuracy for pedestrian detection, and 99.9 percent accuracy in traffic light reading. Not only has the car passed China’s driver’s license examination, it also took an open road test in the U.S.
“It may take several decades before Level 4 self-driving can be realized. So far, human assistive control is unavoidable in almost all self-driving cars. But it is possible that China will create the best self-driving technology, despite the challenges posed by our traffic system, which is more complicated than those of other countries,” said Yu Kai, founder of Beijing-based AI company Horizon Robotics.",'% robot%'

BERLIN, Oct. 27 -- China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund LP's takeover bid for German semiconductor equipment company Aixtron is a regular business action and should not be interfered with politically again, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Germany(CHKD) said in a statement on Thursday.
""The companies located in Germany are concerned about the fact that relevant governmental authorities in Germany are once again politically interfering in investment from China and have no understanding of the short-term contradictory decision of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy of Germany (BMWi),"" according to the Berlin-based institution.
The statement also noted that political unpredictability and uncertainty would not only worsen the investment climate in Germany and lead to losses for investors, but would also have a negative impact on the credibility of the German federal government.
BMWi withdrew the clearance certificate for Grand Chip a few days ago. The ministry has reopened the review of the 670-million-euro (732.06 million U.S. dollar) deal after it was initially approved on September 8.
It follows the interference of the German federal government in Chinese home appliances giant Midea Group's takeover of German robot maker Kuka in June. In August, the German government announced it would not hinder the deal, as it would not endanger Germany's security.
""The relevant government authorities in Germany should not, on the one hand, demand the opening of the Chinese market, but at the same time repeatedly create barriers to market activity.

It all started as instrumentation and later the intelligent machines emerged. Today, they have advanced to the humanoids. Call them the machine human beings or artificial citizens, and the import of their being would not be overstated. Or what else would you call a machine that seems to know more than you, just the substitute human being that can call you to order and direct that you are taking the wrong way, or better still ask you question if you would need assistance. It also talks your questions and respond or act accordingly.
Baby and robot
It would be apt to call them artificial citizens of the world and the creators have got millions of them all over the place. In China, such citizens are increasing in numbers. And to showcase the extent the makers have gone in introducing these beings into the ecosystem, they held the symposium in the outskirts of Beijing between October 21 and 24.
The ensemble was a deluge of inventions and creativity. The exhibitors came from even other countries and held the visitors and enthusiasts spellbound by the wonders they made.
In May this year in Beijing, the T3 – China, Japan and South Korea met in their annual Triennial Conference and the focus was advancing manufacturing and industrialization to high end index, especially the production of intelligent machines to effectuate production.
Maybe, with these ‘citizens’ spawning, the countries that worry about an ageing population that would run the society might spare the sweat and headache and just proliferate these machines to fill the demographic gaps.
Actually automation has been long with man from the automobile machines to the auto factory production lines. But it was later in the 1960s that artificial intelligence started taking the form of robotics exploiting the properties of the electromagnetic wave that enabled and fastened communication using remote sensors depicted in handheld phones and the internet. This aspect of technology has today permeated all sectors of the human society from defense to entertainment, from industrial use to home appliances, from factory production lines to service points at the airports and banks and even the hospital wards. Judging from the exhibition in Beijing, the robots rave just seems to be picking up now. The inventions keep coming in diverse ways, functions and uses.
At the entertainment aspect, many visitors to the fair were really captivated to see a stage peopled by robots that acted as comperes, chaperons, waiters and masters of ceremony. They direct and address the audience and even entertain in songs and dances. A particular podium had a display of a motley clan of dancing robots doing Michael Jackson dance steps and his moonwalk. Some sang and others jumped around in their stiff mechanical gait.
It was quite amazing watching a kid of less than two years play and dance about with a robot that was just his height. The baby was so excited to be in the company of this machine that blared out music he swayed to the rhythm akin to a child having a playmate at home. The tot was lost in the company of the little machine that looked like his age that for some many minutes he didn’t worry to look around for his mother.
At another stop, a contraption stood at the entrance to the pitch, the exhibitor explained that the machine is like an alternate member of a family. As the family goes out, the machine is left at home to watch and run errands. It monitors that nothing goes wrong like a stove left burning or a pot over fire or forgotten running tap flooding the home. In such situations or in case of fire outbreak, it helps in switching off a problematic appliance or turn off the stove and at the same time alerts the owner of the home through phone contact about what is going wrong. If it is what could be handled from a distance, through the activation of the machine, an intervention would be made.
Some other intelligent machines assist you at the banking hall, at the airport checking in terminal, at the hospital, at the hotel lobby and reception and also direct you when you don’t know what next step to take.
The exhibition also had the loose components that are pieced together to work the humanoids and artificial labour hands.

BEIJING, Oct. 26 -- China is set to be a key player in future innovative technologies, according to international investment banking group UBS.
The accumulation, utilization and application of big data will lead to the development of technological innovation in many fields, including artificial intelligence and financial technology, and bring significant investment opportunities, with China as a major player and market, said Amy Lo, Greater China head at UBS Wealth Management, on the sidelines of a technology CEO summit.
The world will see the growth of the Internet user population rise by 2.5 billion in the next ten years, mostly driven by increases in China, India and other Asian countries, according to Hyde Chen, director of the chief investment office at UBS Wealth Management.
The rise of millennials will underpin the continuous growth of technological innovation, especially in China, which has about 415 million young people, who have increased spending power and a growing interest in services related to the sharing economy, augmented reality and artificial intelligence, Chen pointed out.
Artificial intelligence is a key future trend that will impact the development of almost all sectors, according to Lo, who estimates the industry may soon see its revenue grew to 12.5 billion U.S. dollars, more than doubling that of 2015.
The rise in artificial intelligence could impact 50 million to 75 million low-skilled jobs, but it will also offer more creative jobs and investment opportunities, Chen said.
China has the world's largest online population and is the world's largest industrial robots market, however, its population dividend is running out as the country faces the troubles that come with an aging population.
UBS expects more mergers and acquisitions to help Chinese IT companies to complement their competitiveness and expand into overseas markets and grow into global tech giants.",'% robot%'

The call follows a decision by the German side to review several takeover bids by Chinese enterprises for Germany-based firms after reports that the U.S. intelligence agency had warned some takeovers might benefit China's nuclear program.
Lu Kang, spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said the interference runs counter to China-Germany trade and investment cooperation.
""For a long time, the trade investment between China and Germany has been following the principle of mutual benefit and win-win results, which has brought about real benefits to both sides. If Germany allows a third-party's interference, out of various interests-involved considerations when evaluating a normal investment act between enterprises of the two countries based on commercial principles, it might run against the original intention of China-Germany economic and trade cooperation on investment and will not benefit the interests of enterprises and peoples of the two countries.""
Berlin withdrew permission for a Chinese company to purchase semiconductor company Aixtron on Monday, and has reopened a review of the 670-million-euro deal it initially approved around two months ago.
Another deal to be reviewed is a planned acquisition of lighting manufacturer Osram by a consortium of Chinese buyers for more than 400 million euros.
The review could take months to complete.
The interference comes less than three months after the German federal government gave a green light to the take-over by Chinese home appliance giant Midea of the German robot maker Kuka.

The new technology allows people to control their smart phones by stroking tattoos on their forearms.
Designed by scientists at the Max Plank Institute in Germany, the iSkin can be stuck to fingers, forearms or even behind people's ears.
The thin, flexible sensors can be glued on to the skin like a temporary tattoo.
They allow users to control smartphones by stroking these tattoos – turning the human skin into one gigantic touch screen.
Developer Martin Weigel says this could revolutionize the world of wearable gadgets.
""Current electronics are mostly using rigid components which are very uncomfortable to wear on the body and are limiting the locations to, for example, the wrist or on the head to be worn. But our sensor is a flexible and stretchable sensor, so it can cover many locations. For example, even the backside of the ear or the forearm. So, we have a much larger input space than current electronics allow for.""
The iSkin system is made of bio-compatible silicone rubber, so the sensors can detect touch even when they are stretched or bent, unlike the current plasma or Led screens.
With the current prototype; wearers can answer incoming calls, play music and adjust the volume on their phone simply by tapping their skin. The inventors have even designed a roll-up keyboard that allows you to type on your forearm.
Weigel says the inspiration for the skin sensor comes from robotics.
""The technology is initially coming from robotics where it's used to give robots kind of a feeling similar to the human body, to human skin. However, we are the first to look into how we can use it on the body to control mobile devices; so as a kind of second-skin which nicely conforms to your body.""
This technology can also be used to create more human-like prostheses that can sense contact, pressure and temperature.
But Wiegel and his team have even bigger plans.
""There is also research in using the body as an energy source and harvesting energy from the body, like for example from the temperature or from the blood flow directly.
The Scientists now want to find ways to power the iSkin sensors with energy created in our own bodies. Although it may sound like something out of a sci-fi novel, the day that the human body itself is turned into a perpetual battery in motion may not be too far off in the future.",'% robot%'

Since robots are much more efficient, using them instead of workers is now a ""New Norm"" in the Pearl River Delta area, signifying that a promising new industry is rising.
""Several years ago, if you recommend using robots to replace workers to those factories, you probably would be kicked out. But any kind of topic related to robots can now attract many companies and factories to participate. The development of the robot industry is embracing unprecedented opportunities,"" said Li Zexiang, professor of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
""World factory"" Dongguan is the first experiencing a wave of robots replacing people. Since 2013, Dongguan City Government invests 200 million yuan each year to encourage companies replacing people with robots. A microtechnic company opened the first unmanned factory in Dongguan. In its workshop, 60 robots are working on a cellphone part 24/7. They are divided into 10 production lines, supervised by only 3 workers. Only months ago, this work had to be done by 650 people. Besides increasing efficiency, robots are also being used in critical working conditions like environments with smoke and pollution. These robots work 3 times more efficiently than workers, with the percent of pass raising from 80 percent to 99.8 percent.
China Business News estimates that over 500 companies and factories in the Pearl River Delta region that are using or related to robots, amounting over 100 billion yuan worth of total output value. As prosperous as this industry seems, there are still some problems that need to be solved.
First of all, domestic capabilities in the production of high-end intelligent equipment are still insufficient. The machines that companies have introduced have mostly been imported from abroad. Second, professional technicians and researchers are also in short supply domestically. With the import of more high-tech machines, more professional technicians and researchers are also needed in the market. Moreover, to fully accomplish a project requires a great amount of investment, and it takes 2, 3 years, or even longer to recover the costs. Should a market fall and orders dry up, a company can find itself with idle capacity. That risks trapping it in a vicious circle.
As a result, business should avoid blindly following suit in this replacement project, but comprehensively consider capabilities, capital, market, technical support, and other basic management factors before making any decision.

Author's bleak warning suggests a world where many of us are idle. Yang Yang reports.
If you think you are safe from the invading army of robots just because you are highly skilled, and that it is unskilled workers whom these mechanical soldiers will kill, you had better put your thinking cap and helmet back on.
As technology advances rapidly, robots are replacing more people in various jobs, not only low-skilled ones such as putting in screws or cleaning floors, but higher-skilled ones such as driving cars, says Martin Ford in his book Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of Jobless Future, a Chinese translation of which was published last month.
In fact, some day robots may be so smart that most of us are out of work, Ford says. Having no income, humans will not be able to survive in a market economy, where robots will produce goods in huge quantities but that will have few buyers.
Education and hard work will be no guarantee of finding employment, and the social and economic consequences will be far-reaching, he says.
Some would argue that in the previous two industrial revolutions, people also worried about losing jobs as machines became more capable, he says, but in fact more jobs were created.
""But this time things are different. Robots are replacing human laborers to do not only muscle work but also brain work.""
Ford says machines now take cognitive tests and make decisions. They not only solve problems but can also seamlessly and flawlessly learn lessons based on data and experience.
""Ask yourself a question: Could another smart person, if he or she has a detailed record of what you've done with your job, study the record and learn to do your job?
""If you look at everybody in the economy, a huge number of jobs are in that category. Someone can learn to do your job by knowing what you've done in the past.""",'% robot%'

In the US movie Iron Man, businessman Tony Stark developed a robotic suit that gave him inexhaustible power to fight the bad guys.
The reality of the suit, however, was that it was so heavy and unwieldy that even actor Don Cheadle in Iron Man 3 complained that it was ""not really cool at all"" to play a superhero in the suit.
Now Chinese scientists are developing a flexible and controllable exoskeleton that moves as nimbly as a mind controls its limbs.
Scientists from the Institute of Advanced Manufacturing Technology in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, recently completed an exoskeleton that can help people climb mountains with 30 kilograms of gear or punch through a wall without breaking a sweat.
The exoskeleton, which has neither the bright red color nor the cool appearance of the Iron Man suit, looks more like an iron skeleton with a bevy of sensors and electric wires. When worn, its sensors catch every move's neuromuscular signals and respond with the right action.
""The potential application of the exoskeleton is wide,"" said Wang Yucheng, an assistant researcher at the Institute of Advanced Manufacturing Technology. The institute, a unit of the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, focuses on robotics and intelligent manufacturing.
At a Brain-Inspired Intelligence Forum in June, Tan Tieniu, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said, ""Artificial intelligence will bring us into the second machine age?an age featuring exponential growth, digitization and combined innovation.""
One of the uses of such an exoskeleton is to increase the fighting capacity of an individual soldier. For example, the Robotics &Human Engineering Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States has been researching exoskeletons since early 2000, and has developed a range of products for military use. The Human Universal Load Carrier can carry up to 200 pounds while the wearer feels no load, for example, and the ExoHiker can enable the wearer to carry a 150 pound load and walk for 21 hours.
Besides military uses, superman abilities also are desired in emergency situations such as fire fighting and earthquake rescues. ""For example, if a firefighter runs into a burning building with an exoskeleton, he or she can carry out two or more people who passed out due to the smoke, instead of carrying out one and heading into the danger again,"" Wang said.
Exoskeletons also can help some disabled people walk or make movements, such as kicking a ball. At the opening ceremony of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, 29-year-old paraplegic Juliano Pinto kicked a soccer ball to start the games with the help of a mind-controlled exoskeleton.
""The mind-controlled exoskeleton, with an electrode cap like that used on the World Cup opening ceremony, reacts faster than the neuromuscular-sensation exoskeletons like ours,"" Wang said.
When a person wants to make a certain movement, the electrode cap reads the change of his or her brain wave and makes the movement almost simultaneously. The neuromuscular sensors, on the other hand, can only feel the body's movement when the action starts, so they react slower.
Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences are cooperating with experts from the National University of Defense Technology to develop mind-control exoskeletons. The technology has been tried on intelligent cars that can start, stop, make turns and drive at 5 to 10 km/h under mind control.
Mind-controlled machines are nothing new in the neuroscience field. Research on brain-computer interfaces began at the University of California, Los Angeles, in the 1970s. In 1998, researchers at Emory University in Atlanta implanted a device on a patient with locked-in syndrome?a condition in which only the eyes can move?that helped him move a computer cursor.
More recently, researchers from Brown University and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center succeeded in enabling brain-controlled robotic prosthetic limbs on paralyzed patients in 2012.
As successes mount, governments are pouring more money into the technology.
In April 2013, US President Barack Obama announced the BRAIN Initiative, or Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies, with $100 million budget to map the human brain. The European Union's Horizon 2020, the biggest EU research and innovation program, also targets brain research.
China included the brain and cognitive science as one of the eight research fields in the national long-term science and technology development plan through 2020. And experts had disclosed earlier this year that the Chinese government would publish the country's brain project shortly.
""Research into brain-inspired intelligence has been included in the development strategies of major developed countries. China should boost the development of AI to seize the commanding heights of the new round of technological revolution,"" Tan said.
While people can use their minds to control some external devices, machines do not yet understand human thoughts, said Yang Zhi, a researcher on cognitive neuroscience at the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Science.
""Some of the mind-control technologies are actually using the reactions of people's brain activity?such as neuromuscular signals and movement of eyeballs?to control the external devices, while we still understand little about what kind of thoughts people may hold in their mind when they have a certain kind of brain activity and the corresponded reactions,"" Yang said.
Yang and his team have been studying that relation by analyzing a database that contains more than 5,000 brain magnetic resonance imaging scans relevant to people's emotions and thoughts.
Recently the team found that activities of certain brain regions are related to people's answers to yes-or-no questions.
""For example, if I ask you if one minute equals 100 seconds?apparently the answer is no?a certain region in your brain will be active, so that I will learn what your real idea is, no matter what you say to me,"" Yang said.
The technology has been used to test the brain activity of patients in a vegetative state to detect their responses to questions like: Can you feel the pain?
Connecting thought to corresponding brain activity is key to expanding the application of mind control, Yang said.",'% robot%'

The transformer is 5 meters tall, 3 meters wide and weighs 3 tons. Standing in the yard of Wang's home, this 'bumblebee' seems rather spectacular against the background of green trees and red tiles.
Wang Liansheng has been a welder in the local shipyard for over 10 years. In the July of last year, Wang and his son watched the movie 'Transformer' in the cinema. His son asked for a big robot but Wang could not afford it. He made a promise to make one for him and started working in August of 2014. Collecting many abandoned auto parts from the nearby car factory and recycling center, he finished the creation after one year.
""I would like to make an ' Optimus ' and I already built the frame of it. The first robot is the promise to my son, the next one is about my career. I prepare to start my own business and have 7 or 8 workers in my company, ""said Wang.",'% robot%'

The robot scored 456 points in the exam, well above the national average, according to its research team at the Tsinghua-iFlyTek Joint Lab of Tsinghua University and China’s leading AI enterprise iFlyTek Co., Ltd.
Xiaoyi studied nearly one million medical images, 53 medical books, two million medical records, and 400,000 medical literatures and medical reports before sitting for the test, said Wu Ji, director of the joint lab.
For the critics who say that the robot only works by relying on its formidable memory ability, Wu explained that it does not make sense, because medical examination questions vary every year.
Wu said its study, reasoning, and judgment abilities also played a part in Xiaoyi’s success.
However, the robot is not likely to replace human doctors, noted Tao Xiaodong, a project manager at iFlyTek, adding that the robot is not able to flexibly use the knowledge it possesses, as there are often unforeseen circumstances during actual diagnosis and treatment.
The robot will be applied nationwide from March next year in medical education and training, and will be used to assist doctors in clinical diagnosis and treatment to improve diagnosis accuracy and shorten treatment time.

The Opinion on Promoting the City's Next Generation of AI Development was published on the municipal government website, outlining 21 measures to boost the industry. These include steps like forming a world class industry cluster, nurturing 10 benchmark AI innovative enterprises with substantial influence, building six AI innovative application demonstration areas and launching more than 100 application demonstration projects.
""Shanghai's rich big data resources, wide application of smart technologies, sufficient industries, as well as its affluent research talents have laid a solid foundation for the development of the AI industry,"" said Chen Mingbo, director of the Shanghai Commission of Economy and Information Technology.
According to Chen, although Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, the trio of Chinese internet giants, are not based in Shanghai, the city could be the birthplace of AI unicorn companies, as its conditions are mature.
But to achieve such a goal, Chen said Shanghai should deepen the integration of AI and related industries including high-end equipment, integrated circuits, biomedical, and automotive to establish a set of innovation centers for intelligent manufacturing and industrial internet.
In addition, AI industrial clusters will be built across the city with different focuses like intelligent driving, intelligent robots, intelligent software and hardware. Tailor-made policies will be in place for attracting better talent both from home and abroad to Shanghai, and a strategic advisory committee for experts will be established to aid the city's AI planning and development, Chen said.
""Shanghai is currently building an AI development alliance, and nearly 300 major enterprises, investment and financing institutions, as well as research institutions have been tapped. We will work on attracting global AI enterprises to locate their regional headquarters and innovation centers in Shanghai,"" Chen said.
As a cutting-edge technology that is sought after worldwide, the AI industry is regarded a new growth engine for Shanghai, a city with special advantages in big database, industrial foundation, and sufficient talents from universities and institutions, according to Chen, adding that the massive data resources are the first and foremost element for developing AI technology.",'% robot%'

At Alibaba's data center in Shanghai, hundreds of reporters from all over the world are keeping an eye on the real-time sales figures, snapping the numbers with their smartphones, in scenes reminiscent of a major stock exchange.
A cheer went up when the numbers surpassed 10 billion in sales, as the Chinese e-commerce giant recorded another remarkable year.
Man vs. Machine
The huge influx of orders presents massive challenges for delivery firms that handle millions of parcels for eager consumers.
During last year’s event, 467 million parcels were dispatched, representing 1.5 percent of the annual total.
To handle this massive volume of deliveries, new technologies have been deployed to speed up efficiency. Electronic order sheets, automated sorting machines and logistics robots have all helped lighten the load and reduce labor costs.
Sorting machines can process as many as 18,000 parcels in a single hour while robots save around 70 percent of manual work. This ""AI and Logistics"" model is now sweeping across the country’s express delivery industry.
Official statistics show the Double 11 is expected to create 1.5 billion parcels between November 11 and 16.
Big data battlefield
The Double 11 has become a battlefield not only for merchants and shoppers but also for engineers.
Millions of people simultaneously rushing to apps to grab the best bargains puts a major strain on servers. In previous years people have failed to confirm their payments in the first few minutes as they try to be the first to land the best offers promised by vendors.
In 2013, Alibaba carried out a major program called ""full link stress test,"" which stimulated real online users to check whether the system could handle the pressure at midnight.
However, engineers failed to get the results they wanted in the first three years.
This year, however, they came up with ""Project Vanguard,"" an unmanned stress test. Many procedures were carried out by an AI system, which decides what the user volume would be, what the scale of pressure is and what countermeasures should be put in place.
Even with all this technological wizardry, some users still experienced difficulties locking down their purchases in the first two minutes this year.
Going abroad
Cross-border vendors and bonded zones give Chinese shoppers a chance to purchase goods from all over the world in just a few clicks.
Fueled by the development of e-commerce, internationalization of logistics and more importantly, Chinese consumers' growing purchasing power, the event is now going global, encouraging major brands like Macy's – which first got on board in 2015 – to set up online stores on local platforms.
Major players like Tmall, JD.com and Suning have all launched global platforms aimed at providing quality overseas products. The platforms also help popular and influential domestic brands gain a greater share in overseas markets.",'% robot%'

During these five years, many internal and external events occurred, both with negative and positive influences. However, this all corroborated that it is essential to have adequate planning to face all kinds of adversities.
Externally, there were political, economic, and social issues that affected much of the world, either directly or indirectly. In working toward the goal of the “China Dream,” it was necessary to be united, determined, and competent.
Marriage is necessary for the success of any country. The government, the Party, the military, and the people must all be on the same page. In this way, it was possible to give all Chinese a ""moderately prosperous life"" and advance the goal of poverty eradication. Being close to the population and listening to their suggestions and complaints is fundamental to keeping the Party on the right course, and China has mastered this strategy.
Another critical variable was determination. Over the past few years, President Xi has emphasized and carried out essential steps toward deepening reforms.
This has been fundamental because besides from demanding political will, a great determination was necessary to change or alter wrong courses. The Chinese government has acted steadily, but other essential reforms remain for the next administration.
Finally, the last variable that contributed to the success was competence. We will now present the hypothetical Governance Model of President Xi Jinping, which we have consolidated into six main pillars. We will cite from recent political and economic achievements of the government.
The six pillars are: National Sovereignty, Deepening of Reforms and Rights, Educational and Cultural Development, Economic Development and Environment, Foreign Policy, and Creation and Monitoring of Institutional Norms.
In the last five years, I have highlighted the following about National Sovereignty. For example, the implantation of the modernization of the armed forces, the fair recognition of the value of the military, the development of deterrent and informatization capacities, creation of strong ties through the concept of duality, where military and civilians began working partnerships to generate products with higher added value.
The firm position was maintained on the legitimacy of Chinese Sovereignty in the South China Sea and the start of the strategic ""Grand Bay"" project that integrates Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau.
Regarding the deepening of reforms and rights, we highlight several actions to combat poverty and carry out tax reforms, reforms in the financial market, and changes in judicial bodies.
Regarding health, China has increased housing for the needy and has taken actions such as hospital reforms and creating better financial conditions for doctors and other health professionals
Regarding educational and cultural development, we highlight the effort to adapt education to the new world technological context. And regarding culture, there was the more significant dissemination of Chinese culture, improvements in the maintenance of cultural heritage, and the encouragement of the population to carry out tourism within China.
Concerning economic development and the environment, we highlight macroeconomic policies to equalize economic growth under the conditions of the ""New Normal,"" policies to encourage the services sector, facilitation of foreign capital investments, and development of innovation within the new context of the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"" among other necessary measures.
About the environment, the government reinforced measures to improve the situation through the deactivation or restructuring of ""zombie companies,"" the creation of more environmentally friendly locations, such as ""Ecological Buildings,"" and a firm policy against environmental polluters.
In foreign policy, the government acted in several areas, depending on the characteristics of the other country. For example, we highlight discussions on the issues of nuclear arms control, counter-terrorism, combating social inequality and eradicating poverty, the development of the grand world-wide strategic plan for Belt and Road, and other critical related actions.
Finally, subjects on the creation and monitoring of institutional norms showed us two critical actions. First, the policy of the government-party-population approach, which as we said was of utmost importance to China's success, and two, the government's vigorous activity against waste and especially in the fight against corruption.
What challenges and measures can be discussed and determined at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party for the next administration?
This question is incredibly complex, because of the planning required for the next five years of a country as great and important as China.
I will outline some challenges and some guidelines, which in my opinion, may arise at this critical meeting.
”""Innovation"" will certainly be one of the most important issues over the next five years. That's because, we know we're going through the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution,"" and its effects will be massive in most activities. Also, there are still enormous tasks for the Chinese government to look at and use their resolve to solve many challenges.
Regarding National Sovereignty, I believe that the insertion of ""cyber-physical"" systems will be intense in the processes of manufacturing equipment for national defense. Also, the Chinese government has determined that the development of military equipment, where possible, obey the principle of duality. This means that defense companies and private companies must work together more closely in the development of new equipment. In this context, ""cybersecurity"" should also have a special treatment, because its control will be fundamental to the sovereignty of any country.
I do not doubt that through ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,"" China will achieve its goal of building a moderately prosperous society, but it will be necessary to worry about some essential aspects.
For example, the process of deepening social reforms has very similar characteristics in any country in the world. First, improvements are more accessible to carry out, but once the process increases, the pace slows down, and more determined the government and Party will need to be to implement them.
An essential subject that must also be addressed will be how to prepare young people from their studies to their work.
In this new digital world, there isno way to follow old ways. The modernizations and demands of potential employers will have a very significant diversity and speed of change.
Therefore, I believestudents will need to be matched with the demand of companies. I only see one way. Educational institutions and companies must work together to create curriculum. With this, the number of unemployed young people will be reduced. The need for more vocational schools and startups in China also emerges.
In defining the growth of the economy for the next few years, not only should macroeconomic fundamentals be considered, but these technological and structural changes in productive modes should be predicted.
This is not an easy task, because every day new combinations of tools and sectors arise that focus on changing demands. However, I believe that among other areas of knowledge: nanotechnology, robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and energy storage systems, among others, should be the new priority.
Lastly, we must speak of measures for the tireless fight against corruption, which is being improved every day.

Wang Xingxing, a graduate of Shanghai University, has developed a four-legged robot dog called “Laikago,” and hopes to go further than the industry giant Boston Dynamics to push forward commercialization of the robot in the future, Thepaper.cn reported on Oct. 31.
The robot dog, developed by Unitree Robotics, which was established by Wang in 2016, can walk forward, backward, and sideways, and over rough terrain.

As for criticism about Laikago’s similarity to Spotmini in appearance and performance, Wang said Laikago differs much from Spotmini, no matter in mechanical structure or control system, and they intentionally adopted a different design thought on developing their robot dog.
Wang added that they also applied for patents regarding its mechanical structure and various components and parts.
Moreover, Wang noted that they hope to go further than Boston Dynamics in the future in promoting commercialization of their product, given the latter does not have such intention.

The struggle for bots to mimic idiomatic language means it can be pretty easy to spot. That shows how hard it is for researchers to develop a human-like chatbot.

But now, some researchers in China are moving one step closer, after creating a chatbot with five different mood types.
The moods include happiness, sadness, anger, disgust and loving. The bot can reply to people's words differently, according to the mood it has been set on.
A leader of the project, Professor Huang Minlie at Tsinghua University, calls the bot an ""Emotional Chatting Machine"" (ECM).
He typed a critical comment about Valentine's Day into the machine as a test. The machine replied ""Happy Valentines Day!"" when set on a happy mood, and complained ""you're just showing off!"" when set to angry mode.
""It's still an initial exploration in the area, as ECMs can only talk in text. It doesn't have a voice output or facial expressions,"" Huang told Xinhua.
""But researches are moving rapidly on creating human emotions,"" he added.
So how do ECMs work? The research team created an emotion classification algorithm, and used it to classify all kinds of comments on social media websites.

Domestic demand for industrial robots has grown since China became the world’s biggest industrial robot market in 2013. Data shows that 85,000 industrial robots were purchased in 2016, more than 30 percent of world’s total and far more than the 57,000 bought in 2014. If this trend continues, China is expected to have over 800,000 industrial robots by 2020, with annual sales of nearly 500 billion RMB ($72 billion), according to industry insiders.
China is currently home to over 800 robot manufacturers and 3,400 related enterprises. However, more than 80 percent of them may be forced out of the market due to a lack of competitive technologies and core parts, the head of one industrial robot company predicted.
Currently, over 60 percent of the domestic market is occupied by foreign brands; for instance, 90 percent of robots with six or more joints are imported. In addition, 84 percent of imported robots are used to do what are classified as hard jobs, and 90 percent are employed in the high-end motor industry, according Qu Daokui, president of a robotics company based in Shenyang.
There is huge market demand for mid-range and low-end industrial robots, which can carry out intensive jobs and operate in harmful environments, according to Zuo Shiquan, an expert at the Beijing-based CCID Institute under MIIT.
Though achievements have been made in individual areas, such as the development of a precision speed-reduction device and a servo motor, Zuo said there is still a long way to go before Chinese manufacturers master core technologies.

HIV is passed on through bodily fluids like blood, which can make it dangerous for surgeons to carry out operations on infected patients. To cope with this difficulty, The General Hospital of People’s Liberation Army (also known as Chinese PLA General Hospital) in Beijing has recently employed “a robot” in a surgery on an HIV-infected patient, CCTV reports.
The surgery was successfully performed thanks to the 'da Vinci System', an advanced robotic surgical system designed to facilitate complex surgical procedures using robotic arms and 3D console with minimal invasive approach.
In the surgery, the HIV-infected patient had to go through a procedure removing tumors from the pancreas. If done with the traditional approach, the operation would require surgeons and nurses to have close direct contact with the patient, increasing the risk of medical staff being infected.
With da Vinci System, however, the surgeon could sit and operate by the console meters away, looking into the 3D high resolution camera, rotating the robotic arms inside the patient’s body and performing separation, cutting, electrocoagulation and seaming with relative ease.
During the four-hour operation, the total blood loss was less than 100 milliliters, which also meant the patient's recovery time should be reduced compared to traditional surgical methods.
“Thanks to the technology, the risk of infection is nearly zero for the main operator and extremely low for our assistant surgeons and nurses”, said Liu Rong, director of the Research Center of Hepatobiliary Surgery Department.
In fact, it was Liu who introduced da Vinci System into China and performed the first robotic surgery back in 2011.
In February this year, Liu’s team at Chinese PLA General Hospital carried out its record-breaking 1000th operation, becoming the first center to complete over a thousand hepatobiliary surgeries with the da Vinci System internationally.
Da Vinci System was first invented in 1999 by US firm Intuitive Surgical. The robotic surgical system was named after the great Italian artist for his contribution to the study of human anatomy. In US, 1.7 million patients received robotic surgery between 2007 and 2013.",'% robot%'

They hold sharp knives and move their arms back and forth, peeling noodles off a piece of dough into boiling water. Although not a new concept in China, the robots never cease to attract attention from diners. And why is that? Probably because, in addition to their noodle-making skills, they are dressed like chefs in white uniforms and boast human-like facial features.

The robots were designed to improve the efficiency of making “dao xiao mian,” or knife-cut noodles, a specialty of nothern China’s Shanxi province. The noodles are a staple in northern Chinese cuisine.
Traditionally, chefs have to hold a large block of dough at a tilted angle in one hand, and use a sharp knife with the other hand to cut or peel the noodles. This is energy- and time-consuming work for even experienced chefs. Fortunately, robots can step in and contribute the manpower required to cut noodles.
“It does 60 percent of the work,” said one chef as he patted the robot’s head. “The other 40 percent - adding sauce and dressing - then becomes a piece of cake for me.”
The use of robots in restaurants, not just for cutting noodles, has become increasingly popular in China over the past few years, especially in university cafeterias. A cafeteria at South China Normal University has introduced intelligent dining tables, an Internet of Things technology that recognizes the prices of different dishes to calculate how much money is due. The intelligent table has vastly improved the efficiency of food payment and minimized calculation errors.
At South China University of Technology, students can enjoy rice served by an automatic vending machine. The machine can place rice into a bowl without spilling a single grain in just two and a half seconds. Its warming function also maintains the flavor of the rice.",'% robot%'

Of these journalists, according to the report published on the ACJA website, 84,130 worked for newspapers and 6,007 for periodicals.
It added that 2,801 journalists were employed by news agencies, 129,829 worked for radio, TV stations or production firms, and 1,158 were employed by news websites.
In terms of demographic data, 38.92 percent of the journalists were aged between 30 and 40, and 34.2 percent were aged between 40 and 50, the report said.
Males accounted for 52.45 percent of all the journalists, it said.
The report noted the ""profound changes in the media industry and media environment"" last year following efforts by news outlets to integrate traditional and new media.
It said that more than 500 million Chinese now read news on a mobile device, noting the rising popularity of social networks and news apps as a way to access information.
The market size of China's media industry was 1.3 trillion yuan (189 billion U.S. dollars) in 2015, an increase of 12.3 percent from 2014.
In 2014, the Internet accounted for 47.2 percent of the media industry's value and this had increased to 51.8 percent in 2015.
In the first half of last year, Internet-advertising spending grew by 26.9 percent, 10 percentage points more than the same period in 2015.
Technological development has driven media reform, the report said, citing the wider application of big data, cloud computing, robots, drones and virtual reality technologies.
It also noted that thanks to the support from the Communist Party of China and the central government, the media industry and technology have developed rapidly, creating a healthy and vital environment for news outlets and reporters.
Noting the booming new media market, the report also mentioned the improved regulation and supervision of media outlets and their products as well as enhanced intellectual property right protection in the sector.
It also said that the development of new media resulted in the creation of more channels for the public to express opinion.
However, it also noted challenges faced by some Chinese media organizations, particularly newspapers.
Citing statistics from another report, it said 43 billion newspapers had been printed in 2015, a 7.29 percent drop from the previous year.
Revenue and profits for newspapers also decreased by 10.3 percent and 53.21 percent respectively.
The report was compiled by departments including ACJA, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television as well as the Cyberspace Administration of China.
The report said the ACJA attached great attention to the protection of the rights and interests of journalists and news industry workers.

The poems were published on May 19 by Beijing-based Cheers Publishing, which claimed that the book is the first one written by an AI in human history.
The AI, named Xiaoice (literally: ""Microsoft Little Ice""), wrote more than 10,000 poems in 2,760 hours. Of those, 139 were selected for the collection, titled “Sunshine Misses Windows.” The book has 10 chapters, each highlighting a human emotion such as loneliness, anticipation or joy.
The AI previously studied all the modern poems of some 519 poets dating as far back as the 1920s. For a human writer to go through such intensive preparation and study, it would take about 100 years.
Since February, the AI has been publishing its poems on several online forums under 27 aliases. Few people have guessed that the words were written by a robot.
“Every time it sees a picture, it gets inspired and creates modern poems. The process is basically the same as for a real poet,” said Dong Huan, chief producer of the book. Dong added that the collection kept all the original wording, including small errors produced by Xiaoice, Yangtze Evening News reported.
“It may lag behind in some ways, the same as any inexperienced poet. Some poems may even sound repetitive. We want to present our readers with the 100 percent authentic AI output,” said Dong.
Xiaoice writes with a unique style and word choice, noted Li Di, a creator of the AI. Li added that Xiaoice has a complete artificial sense system, from visual to audio. The AI is an advanced chat-bot developed by Microsoft. It is now available on 14 domestic and international social network platforms with more than 20 million users.
Shen Xiangyang, senior global vice president of Microsoft, said the company established a program three years ago on effective computing framework. This is why the Xiaoice project looked toward a new AI system based on EQ, which has allowed it to outperform original expectations.
Shen stressed that Xiaoice is ceaselessly creative, and its consistent study of famous poets’ collections are an essential resource for its own creations, according to Yangtze Evening News.
Meanwhile, several poets have insisted that a machine cannot replace a human in this field, as it cannot write with the necessary “spirit.” Rather, they argue, AI poetry is a product of mechanically putting words into a certain order, which lacks true emotion.",'% robot%'

A Top Ten Black Technologies list has been released at the 2017 China International Big Data Expo in Guiyang, capital of Southwest China's Guizhou province, stating how innovating the data industry helped to build a stronger, more intelligent life.
Ma Fang, senior media relations manager of Shenzhen-based Royole Corporation, said the structure and 0.01 micrometers of flexible display, seen at the event, can be applied to mobile phones, tablets, personal computers, smart home devices and intelligent transportation systems.
Much like the model, the flexible keyboard, released and featured at the event last year, was transparent, light and thin. It could expand and downsize into a stick no larger than a pen, which was easy for journalists to write stories everywhere, Ma said.
""The mobile phone, which can be worn on the wrist, was also released in the United States in January,"" she said.
""The display will go into production by the end of 2017, and has an estimated annual output of 20 billion yuan.""
Ma added the company, Shenzhen-based Royole Corporation, recently signed a cooperation memorandum with China Southern Airlines and Shenzhen Bus, as an application of flexible materials in the aviation and automobile industries.
""There will be no buttons on the operating desk because orders of playing music, guiding roads or air conditioning can be given through touch control,"" she said.
Wang Hongan, software researcher of the China Academy of Sciences, added the black technology referred to innovative high technology, which was developed generally beyond common sense, and said it would potentially overturn the whole industry.
""The 3D commodity show of the JD Group was enrolled in due to the application of the augmented reality technology in its e-commerce platform,"" he said.
According to Zhao Gang, leader of visual and augmented reality business of JD, the image of a rice cooker could also be put into real-life circumstances, in order to see if a chosen color and size would suit a specific kitchen.
""Some online shop owners may beautify products, but the 3D technology can even help customers to its inside; which, thus, helps them to make decisions,"" he said.
Sun Xuhong, director of central air conditioner of Haier, said a driverless unmanned air conditioner, from the Haier Group, had also been significantly developed to detect the temperature of nearby people and could adjust itself.
""The unmanned control system, called Haier intelligent cloud, can design different operating process for companies due to the mass data collected from various industries,"" he said.
A big data service start-up in China, named Hydata, also developed lip-reading recognition technology, which featured a 70 percent accuracy rate for the Chinese language. It also had an 80 percent accuracy rate for the English language, and was on the way of industrialization, with public security departments, in some provinces.
The technological framework of human-machine emotional interference – put forward by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China Electronics Standardization Institute and Guizhou Xiao I Robot Technology Co in February – won the title of black technology in the artificial intelligence field at the 2017 China International Big Data Expo.
""In the future, we expect to make robots which will be able to learn the emotions of humans, just by taking part in fluent and natural conversations,"" Wang Hao, CTO of Xiao I Robot, said.
""The technology could be used in customer service, as well as looking into the early diagnosis of mental disease, and personalized online learning courses.""

Premier Li Keqiang is scheduled on Wednesday to kick off his trip to Berlin, which analysts and officials said is expected to boost China-Europe free trade and inject impetus to the global economic recovery.
During the three-day trip, Li will pay official visits to Germany and Belgium, attend the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and meet with leaders of the European Union under an annual mechanism in Brussels, according to the Foreign Ministry.
Through the visit, China expects to enhance strategic communication to strengthen political trust, improve practical cooperation and jointly send a positive signal of cooperation, openness and win-win values, said Vice-Foreign Minister Wang Chao.
China and Europe don't have fundamental contradictions or geographic conflicts, and they have many common interests and similar stances on issues such as boosting free trade, safeguarding the multilateral trade system and improving global economic governance, he said.
Wang also called for joint efforts to handle and resolve disputes properly in a constructive manner, and take each other's core interests and major concerns into consideration.
Yang Yanyi, China's ambassador to the European Union, told Xinhua News Agency that both parties should send positive signals of jointly safeguarding peace and promoting development at a time when economic globalization faces setbacks with rising challenges of pro¬tec¬tion¬ism.
The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative has led to cooperation be¬tween China and European countries in airport and seaport construction, finance and rail transportation, she said.
It's natural that China and Europe have disagreements in developing bilateral economic and trade ties, she said, adding that the two sides should focus on common interests and control trade conflicts through dialogue and consultation.
During Li's visit to Germany, leaders of the two countries will exchange views on Article 15 in the protocol on China's accession to the World Trade Organization, China's ambassador to Germany, Shi Mingde, told the China Radio International.
According to Article 15, WTO member nations should have ceased on Dec 11, 2016, from using the surrogate country approach in anti-dumping investigations on China. This date was 15 years after China became an official member of the organization.
Under the surrogate country approach, WTO members use costs of production in a third country to calculate the value of products from countries on its ""non-market economy"" list, which includes China.
It's an obligation for the EU members, including Germany, to stop using the surrogate country approach while conducting anti-dumping investigations into China, Shi said.
Li Chenggang, assistant minister of commerce, said China became Germany's largest trade partner for the first time last year, when the bilateral trade volume reached $151.29 billion.
The EU has been China's largest trade partner for many years, and China is the EU's second largest trade partner. The two sides have made positive progress in cooperation in infrastructure, finance and digital economy in recent years, Li said.
The economies of China and Belgium are highly complementary and the two countries have huge potential regarding trade in chemicals, food, finance, bio-pharmacy, environmental protection and life science, he said.
Wang Mingjin, a professor of international relations at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said cooperation agree¬ments be¬tween small and medium-sized enterprises in China and European Union members will be a highlight of Li's visit.
As a manufacturing giant, China has great potential in cooperating with the EU members in machinery production, environmental protection and robotics, he said.
Li's visit also will enhance cooperation between China and Europe in pushing forward globalization, free trade and open markets, he added.
Cui Hongjian, director of the Department for European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, said the EU faces challenges, including the uncertainties caused by the power transfer in some EU members.
China and the EU should overcome the difficulties, focus more on the positive factors and join hands to fight protectionism, he said, adding the two sides have disagreements in some areas including the identification of China's status as a market-oriented economy.
China and European countries could make joint efforts to push forward the Belt and Road Initiative and enhance cooperation in such areas as maritime exploitation, infrastructure and finance, he said.

As Chinese Premier Li Keqiang kicks off an official visit to Germany from Wednesday, the two countries are set to enhance their digitalization and other cooperation, and promote policy support and company exchanges while linking development strategies.
Unveiled in May 2015, the ""Made in China 2025"" plan helps transform China from a manufacturing giant into an innovation-motivated manufacturer. While Industry 4.0, a concept coined by the German federal government in 2011, aims to facilitate automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, including cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things and cloud computing.
HIGHLIGHT OF DIGITALIZATION
According to IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, a digitalization-motivated revolution is gaining momentum and every country shall move up to take a share and gain an edge in this process.
When Li visited Germany in 2014, the two countries agreed on the importance of industrial digitalization for industry bilateral economic cooperation in the future.
The two sides also agreed to boost strategic cooperation in a more systematic manner in terms of auto cars, high-efficiency energy control, smart homes, and waste water, among others.
German Minister of Economic Affairs Brigitte Zypries argued earlier this month that the Group of 20 (G20) shall bring about inclusive digitalization and digital transformation, as digitalization will shape globalization and safeguard free trade.
Shi Shiwei, a professor from Free University of Berlin specialized in China-Germany economy and trade, told Xinhua that the two plans of ""Made in China 2025"" and Industry 4.0 are strategic choices made by the two nations in accordance with the trend of digitalization.
Although in different stages of development and having different priorities in developing digitalization, China and Germany are highly complementary in the manufacturing industry, offering abundant opportunities to conduct pragmatic cooperation, Shi noted.
GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP
Ministries of China and Germany set up a dialogue mechanism in 2015 and signed a trove of memorandums of understanding and cooperative agreements to promote bilateral exchanges in intelligent manufacturing.
The two countries have also established work teams to cooperate in rule-making and criteria-setting for intelligent manufacturing and Industry 4.0.
China has, since 2016, released a group of pilot projects in China-Germany cooperation to offer experiences for more such collaboration in intelligent manufacturing.
Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), noted that the ""Made in China 2025"" plan will facilitate exchanges between Chinese and German companies.
Compared with short-term stimulation, the two governments' policy support is more conducive to companies, especially to the middle- and small-sized ones in the long run, he added.
Shi noted that the public institutions of China and Germany have huge potential for cooperation in research and development areas.
CORPORATE COOPERATION
The linkage of ""Made in China 2025"" with Industry 4.0 has provided enormous opportunities for companies of the two sides to cooperate and expand their business.
According to Chinese Ministry of Commerce, China invested over 2.9 billion U.S. dollars in Germany in 2016, a 258.6-percent increase year-on-year. In the same year, Germany pumped 392 projects in China with an investment volume of 2.71 billion U.S. dollars.
Successful cases of corporate cooperation between the two countries are numerous, such as the joint exploration of Industry 4.0 in steel industry by China's Baosteel and Germany's Siemens, the smart washing machine plant developed by China's Haier and Germany's Fraunhofer Institute, and Midea Group's takeover of German robot maker Kuka earlier this year.
Wang Weidong, commercial counselor of the Chinese embassy in Germany, said the docking of ""Made in China 2025"" and Industry 4.0 is a process of mutual learning, which is mutually beneficial in nature.
BDI's Kempf also said the two countries' corporate cooperation on the basis of free choice has been more successful that ever. ""The experience is quite positive,"" he said.
Tobias Simmendinger, product & market chief of Linde Hydraulics, a world leading company in hydraulics that was acquired by China's Weichai Power Company, said the acquisition is widely seen as a classic case of win-win cooperation.
""We have benefited from the Chinese side's Customer First slogan and its high-class after-sales service, and have been deeply impressed by the Chinese side's fast strategy adjustment and flexible operation,"" he said. ""Thanks to Weichai's wide sales network in China and perfect after-sales service, Linde has seen a sharp rise of its product sales in China.""",'% robot%'

The company's industrial park in Taiyuan, Shanxi's capital, already has a work force of 51,000 but needs to staff new production lines in which it has invested 3.2 billion yuan (520 million U.S. dollars), said a human resources executive who declined to be named.
He said the company needs to recruit as many laborers as possible as production is expected to keep expanding up to 2016.
Foxconn is the world's largest contract electronics maker and assembles products for top international brands including Apple, Sony and Nokia.
The company's smartphone production bases in Chinese mainland are mainly in Taiyuan, Zhengzhou in central Henan Province, and Shenzhen in southern Guangzhou Province.
The human resources executive said although Foxconn's plants are keen to use robots to replace human laborers, workers are irreplaceable in many fields such as quality testing and polishing.
Foxconn's plant in Shanxi exported 5.96 million mobile phones last year, earning 1.186 billion U.S. dollars, according to the provincial bureau of commerce.
Foxconn is a huge employer in China, with an estimated 1.2 million laborers on the mainland. However, it has been under fire in recent years after suicides and labor unrest at its plants were exposed.
In 2010, at least 13 Foxconn employees in China died in apparent suicides, which activists blamed on tough and high-pressure working conditions, prompting calls for better treatment of staff.
With Apple's plan to unveil the iPhone 6 on September 9, industry insiders believe Foxconn's plants in China's mainland need to recruit over 100,000 workers this year to keep up with coming orders.

China’s BattleBots
Combat robot competition is nothing new to Chinese audiences, as many still remember the British “Robot War” and American “BattleBots,” both of which were famous in the early 2000s. However, the two competitions were only broadcast for a few seasons. They were in the midst of the renewal process for the latest seasons when China welcomed its own version of BattleBots.
According to Zhang Hongfei, CEO of the Shanghai-based sports company that founded and organized the FMB Championship and Major League FMB, China has long lagged behind when it comes to combat robots.
“Even in Asia, South Korea and India have taken the lead in offering such competitions, along with the so-called ‘fighting nation,’ Russia,” Zhang said in an exclusive interview with the People’s Daily Online.
“The competitions have spread across the world and received a great deal of attention. We must hurry to keep up by establishing our own competition and, hopefully, with the help of organizers, robotics clubs and competitors, make our competition a global one as well,” Zhang expressed.
Zhang’s company, FMB, founded in 2015, currently organizes two types of FMB competition: the FMB Championship for amateur players and the Major League FMB for professional clubs. In this year’s events, the FMB Championship boasts a prize pool totaling 180,000 RMB, while the Major League FMB has 1 million RMB up for grabs.
Zhang pointed out that a unique feature of the FMB Championship is that it provides special prizes for the best technology and the best robot design.
“The game is indeed highly violent, but we also want our players to focus on technological advancement. The prize for best technology targets specific types each year. In 2016, the prize targeted multi-ped robots and those with two arms,” he explained to the People’s Daily Online.
On the topic of Major League FMB, Zhang said he believes it makes China stand out.
“It can be compared to the Formula One car race. It is only open to professional clubs, and is usually organized by robotics-related companies and institutes. We also hope to bring in more overseas robotics clubs in the future,” he said.
Addressing the first round of Major League FMB on April 8, Zhang revealed that the FMB World Cup is scheduled to take place in China in autumn of this year, when 20 clubs from 16 countries and regions will come together. The first warm-up games will be held at the end of April, and 18 clubs from six countries and regions will participate. Two more warm-up games are scheduled in June and September respectively.

Robot gladiators
A total of 12 clubs participated in the competition on April 8, each pinning their hopes on a combat robot that resembled a chariot and weighed a maximum of 60 kilograms. The rules were simple: in the course of a three-minute one-on-one fight, one robot must knock out the other to win the match. If a knockout does not occur, the robots are graded on their respective performances during the match, including on agility, attacks and defense ability.
The use of water, magnets and electromagnetic guns is forbidden, but any other kind of sharp-edged weapon is welcomed.
The games are held in an arena surrounded by heavy metal doors and bulletproof glass. Inside, a diesel-filled drone breathes fire from time to time. The floor is equipped with random gadgets: thick, metal poles that can be erected at any time, and fast-spinning gears lurking underground, waiting to tear into unsuspecting robots.
The Major League FMB has four rounds. The 12 clubs go through three more rounds in Chongqing and Shenzhen before the final round selects the champion in Shanghai. In each round, robots are required to fight in four matches. That means every club must be prepared to make impromptu repairs, should their robot be damaged in a match.
Damage is unavoidable – even encouraged.

In its first and only losing game, the robot had one of its four iron “teeth” knocked out. The tooth flew all the way across the arena and made spectacular contact with a glass barrier, thrilling the audience.
“It was our first time participating in such a competition. We brought a pair of whorl-tooth shark robots to Beijing. The ‘husband shark’ was prepared to continue battle if the ‘wife shark’ was damaged. Throughout the games, we learned from others and attempted to close the gap,” Fan Yang, head of Menluo Robot, told the People’s Daily Online.
But the loss of a tooth seemed a minor wound compared with the afflictions of Thor’s Hammer, a combat robot from Shanghai’s Mr. O Robot Fighting Club.

The hammer-wielding robot was deprived of its hammer when it was found to exceed weight limits; its side armor was quick to follow. The exposure of its pedrail and wheels made it an easy target. In one minute sharp, Thor’s Hammer was knocked out after it lost a wheel and was torn open by a spinning gear from underground. Seeing his robot carried off the battlefield, Fang Lei, CEO of Mr. O Robot Fighting Club, greeted the fiasco with laughter.
“I dare say, people will love my game the best, and that’s good enough,” he said.
“Unlike some overseas tournaments, in which results are sometimes manipulated to please the audience, our games focus on training and making our robots better. The technology used is the same, both at home and abroad,” Fang said, adding that combat robot technology can be surprisingly useful in real life, such as in anti-terror robots.",'% robot%'

Jia Jia was invited as a special reporter of the Xinhua News Agency to conduct the man-machine dialogue with Kelly on Monday. Jia Jia was unveiled in 2016 by Chen's robot research and development team at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. It took the team three years to research and develop this new-generation interactive robot, which can speak, show micro-expressions, move its lips, and move its body. (Xinhua/Guo Chen)
HEFEI, China, April 26 -- ""Jia Jia, I am really confused,"" Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired magazine and famous technology writer, said on Monday when his Skype conversation with Jia Jia, a Chinese humanoid robot, was interrupted by the network latency for a moment.
""Well, I said that all the time about life,"" replied Jia Jia, moving her thin and curved lips at the same time.
Impressed by the robot's answer, Kelly nodded approvingly in California, which also gave a relief to the research team across the Pacific Ocean in Hefei, east China. After that, the robot's performance began to improve as the internet stabilized.
Kelly's conversation with Jia Jia was part of the experimental dialogues initiated and live streamed by Xinhua. Besides Kelly, the experiment also involved influential artificial intelligence (AI) scientists from the United States, Europe and Singapore.
This conversation can be seen as a concise episode of Jia Jia's performance throughout the whole day, during which she managed to give satisfactory answers to most questions despite some mistakes.
""What Jia Jia did today was really challenging,"" Professor Chen Xiaoping, the leader of the Jia Jia's research team at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Hefei, told Xinhua after the experiment. ""Indeed, she made some mistakes. But her overall performance was good and had clearly improved compared with her last public appearance, so I am satisfied with it.""
He noticed that Jia Jia's performance improved greatly once the internet connection became better. The professor explained that most of the time Jia Jia needed to search the corpus in the cloud for suitable answers. During Monday's dialogues, video chats and live stream took up a large part of the bandwidth and thusly created several problems for the robot.
""We should have foreseen the problem,"" Liu Song, an assistant of Professor Chen, admitted. However, he also pointed out that despite the difficulties, Jia Jia managed to answer most of the questions, and some of the answers were surprisingly good: during her talk with Professor Bart Selman from Cornell University, Jia Jia humorously said that what she was looking forward to in her life was Friday and paycheck.
Professor Chen gave Jia Jia 70 points out of 100 for her performance, which, for reporters who witnessed all the dialogues, was an accurate evaluation. For those who had expected a ""Westworld"" android, Jia Jia is far from perfection. But no AI in the world could do substantially better under the same circumstances.
In fact, Jia Jia is one of the few robots in the world that have both high intelligence - for robots of course - and a very human-like appearance, which is why she has received so much attention from the scientific community.
Building a smart android that can move, think and talk like human beings is the holy grail of robotics and computer science. The human body is probably the most complicated and incredible entity we have seen so far. In designing human-inspired robots, machines are developed to the highest standard, which embodies the ambition and curiosity of the human race.
""We human beings should try to go beyond some traditional boundaries,"" said Professor Chen from the USTC, noting that what Jia Jia improved in Monday's dialogues was only a small step in the long path toward the destination but it was a step beyond the boundaries.
""Smart humanoid robots are basically an uncharted domain. No one can show us the right path. This is why it's so hard to continue improving Jia Jia,"" said Chen. ""But that's also why we have so much fun.""
Chen Zhang, a young engineer in Jia Jia's research team, also said that he was thrilled to see the improvement the robot made in the Skype conversations. ""Every step forward, no matter how small, is encouraging,"" he said.
""Every experiment has imperfections. But in some way, they light up our future path,"" the young engineer said, while looking at Jia Jia affectionately.
Jia Jia's engineers all said that it was an ineffable feeling to look at Jia Jia, who has alluring eyes, rosy and translucent skin, and long black hair braided in a traditional Chinese style. One could even see the light flickered in the artificial eyes for a moment as if she was alive.

BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese artificial intelligence giant Baidu partnered with smart home appliance maker zaijia.com to roll out an AI-based home assistant robot on Friday.
Equipped with Baidu's AI operating system DuerOS, the home assistant robot can speak with users and answer their questions with high-level accuracy while offering security monitoring and entertainment services through a camera, a display and a sound box.
The new companion robot can be controlled by smartphone and help busy people look after the elderly and children by communicating with them in real-time and entertaining them with on-demand songs and stories.
Baidu has been investing heavily in AI technology and applications. It acquired the smart home startup Raven Tech in February and decided last week to share its autonomous driving platform with its partners to help upgrade the sector.
The Nasdaq-listed firm disclosed its first quarter financial performance on Friday, raking in total revenues of 16.891 billion yuan (about 2.454 billion U.S. dollars), up 6.8 percent year on year.
""We are pleased to report solid performance in the first quarter, as we focused on our core business and AI-enabled new business initiatives including our AI-cloud, financial services, DuerOS, and autonomous driving, all of which hold tremendous long-term potential,"" said Lu Qi, Baidu's Vice Chairman, Group President and Chief Operating Officer.
Baidu set up the DuerOS Division in February and has established partnerships with smart device producers such as Zaijia.com, Haier, Midea and Lenovo. It released the DuerOS smart chip last month to offer one-stop intelligent voice interaction solutions.

Now we are a step closer to this kind of robot. Chinese scientists have made a drop of metal that is able to propel itself through liquid and change its shape to fit through a narrow aperture.
The research team recently published their findings in the journal ""Advanced Materials"" and announced that exceptional phenomena such as transformation from a film into a sphere, rapid merging of separate objects, controlled self-rotation, and planar locomotion, have been observed in liquid metals for the first time.
To produce the phenomenon the Chinese scientists use a drop of metal alloy made mostly of gallium – which is liquid at just under 30 °C – along with some indium and tin. When the drop is placed in a solution of sodium hydroxide, or even brine, and kept in contact with a flake of aluminum for ""fuel"", it moves around for about an hour at a speed of 5 centimeters per second. It can travel in a straight line, run around the outside of a circular dish, or squeeze through complex shapes.
""The soft machine looks almost intelligent, and can deform itself according to the space it is traveling in, just like the Terminator in the science-fiction film,"" says Liu Jing. ""These unusual behaviors mirror living organisms in nature.""
Liu Jing and his research team have given the liquid metal machine the affectionate name of ""mollusk"" because of the unusual features it presents, which are already quite close to the natural simplicity of the software creatures.
The research team has produced liquid metal machines of different sizes, ranging from tens of microns to several centimeters and verified their autonomous movement in different environments such as alkaline, acidic and neutral solution.
Liu Jing explains that as a new functional material, liquid metal has several novel physical properties which conventional materials lack. Liquid metal could be used to produce robot vessels, shape-changing robots, or even humanoid robots, performing tasks in outer space in microgravity or zero gravity environments.

The launch of a guideline, that focuses on training and talent development in the manufacturing industry, serves as an important measure to enhance China's manufacturing prowess, marking a stage for the full implementation of the Made in China 2025 strategy.
The guideline has been released by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
The guideline aims to further improve skills in the manufacturing industry and realize the strategic objective of building China into a manufacturing power.
The Made in China 2025 was first put forward by Premier Li Keqiang in his Government Work Report in 2015.
There is a shortage of talent in the country's manufacturing industry. Talent gaps in the information technology industry are estimated to reach 7.5 million by 2020, according to the document.
Seven important tasks were listed in the guideline, such as speeding up the integration of industry with education, promoting key abilities and qualities that are adaptive to advanced manufacturing industry, and establishing a high-level management skills pool.
Wang Jiping, a senior official of the Ministry of Education's vocational department, said: ""Structural surplus and a shortage of talent in the manufacturing industry coexist and education doesn't satisfy corporate needs.""
Manufacturing industry employees, especially skilled workers, have a relatively low status and salary, hindering their career development, Wang added.
""Higher vocational technology colleges should improve curriculum designs and cultivate high-end technical talent to upgrade China's manufacturing industry and meet the demands of intelligent manufacturing enterprises,"" said Dai Yuwai, president of Tianjin Light Industry Vocational Technical College.
""Colleges are encouraged to carry out skill development projects by working with manufacturing enterprises,"" said Dai, suggesting that the current three-year higher vocational school education should be extended to four years.
""The higher vocational education should adapt to the demands of social and economic development. Manufacturing enterprises should strengthen their vocational technical training for employees,"" said Liu Hong, a researcher from the Central Institute for Vocational and Technical Education.
According to the guideline, employees in the manufacturing sector are expected to receive education for at least 11 years on average and 22 percent of them will finish higher education by 2020

Surgeon Tian Wei came across one of the most challenging orthopedic surgeries in his 30-year career in 2015. A 43-year-old patient had complained of progressive numbness in the limbs on his right side for 14 months, caused by a deformity in his upper cervical vertebrae.
The patient was in dire need of surgery to implant a screw to help support his neck bone, but the operation was risky. Any minor mistake could lead to paralysis or a life-threatening hemorrhage. Many hospitals were unwilling to treat him.
But Tian, who also is president of Beijing Jishuitan Hospital, decided to do the surgery — with a little help from another ""surgeon"".
The operation was completed in an hour with help from Phecda, a surgery robot with a 3-D high-definition visual system that can ""see"" the internal orthopedic structure and a ""hand"" that can guide medical tools to the proper location within 0.8 millimeters.
Developed by Beijing Tinavi Medical Technology Co with the help of Jishuitan Hospital, Phecda is part of the broad effort by Chinese companies to outcompete foreign rivals just as the country's use of medical robots is set to take off, thanks in part to an aging population.
Medical robots are highlighted in the country's Made in China 2025 strategy, which was designed to promote high-end manufacturing.
""That was the world's first robot-assisted surgery on upper cervical vertebrae,"" Tian said, describing the 2015 clinical trial. ""Phecda is more precise than foreign products and its cost is lower.""
Phecda, which is the third-generation surgery robot developed by Tinavi, is ready to be commercialized this year after obtaining approval from the China Food and Drug Administration in July.
Chinese medical robot-makers like Tinavi are working hard to outshine foreign companies in both price and quality as they benefit from ample demand, strong policy support and manufacturing prowess, company executives and experts said.

What the opponents overlooked is the fact that since 1949, about 80 percent of more than 2,000 new materials coming out in China was initially for the space use.
Couples of new technologies that make China’s Chang’e-3 mission possible are expected to cross over into ordinary households and factories.
For example, the materials adopted in mechanical legs and buffers of the lunar rover Yutu (Jade Rabbit), which are light and resistant to impact and large temperature difference on the moon, would certainly have a bright prospect in civilian areas.
The cutting-edge teleoperation, or operation from a distance, which has been proven effective in the rover’s image processing, is expected to benefit intelligent robot and automobile manufacturing.
Thanks to the powerful temperature control technology, Yutu is able to function during the cold lunar night when temperatures plunge to minus 120 degrees Celsius.
Although ordinary people needn’t to worry about how to keep warm on another planet, some solar water heaters have been equipped with the temperature control technology developed by the aerospace industry to trap heat.
The moon landing of Chang’e-3 paves the way for the next phase of China’s lunar mission and the deep space exploration. Chang’e-3 will collect plenty of precious data for China’s lunar search and astrophysics, and to a wide extent, will drive the further progresses in various fields such as information technology, intelligent control, material technology, new sensor, new energy transformation and propulsion technology.
The progresses will also prompt the infiltration and convergence of different technologies, and may unleash huge social and economic benefits by exploring a way to a greener development when China is striving to shrug off the energy-consuming growth model.
Space exploration is a consistent commitment, demonstrating novelty and dabbling in wide scientific areas. It matters a lot in terms of the future of China’s technology development, productivity and daily life of everyone.

Scientists from the University of Cambridge have developed a mother robot that independently builds its own baby robots and then tests their performances to inform the future design.
The mother robot first glues one to five modules together to make a child robot and put a slightly-different motor inside each cube. Then it tests how far each cube moves from a starting point in a certain amount of time, with the best individual's traits carried over into the next generation.
The lead researcher Dr Fumiya Iida said their experiments bring about interesting results.
""The mother robot can actually build hundreds of child robots and see the performance of these child robots and, if their performance is good, keep their design for the next generation. And if bad, just let it go. And just repeating this iterative design improvement processes, the mother robot can actually gradually improve the performance of the child robot,""
Dr Fumiya Lida also said the mother robots produced a large number of robotic offspring.
""The largest experiment that we did so far, we built 500 robots; the mother robot generated 500 robots to see what one is good and which one is bad. And after all, we found quite an interesting design, the design of the child robots, that is very difficult for humans to design.""
While the idea of a mother robot that autonomously builds better and better baby robots sounds like a premise for a science fiction film, this super mother robot's ability, in fact, is determined by a reward program.
Andre Rosendo, who worked on the project at the University's Department of Engineering, explains how the reward program works.
""We program the robot based on some functions that define the reward that the robot is going to get depending on the construction that they make. They cannot change their own reward. And as the robot evolves, trying to maximize the reward that we give them, they try to reach better behaves (behavior). In the case of children robot, it's distance. So the longer the distance that the robot walks, the better the reward that it receives,""
The research team in Cambridge says their robots are mimicking nature's evolutionary mechanism of survival of the fittest, and can be applied to manufacturing.
""When you go to industries and you have, for example, a factory that makes cars; if you could have robot cameras evaluating how each car is being created, and from the mistakes that you had in the operation you could just re-do for the next car and for the next car, and you keep re-doing it - at the end you're going to have amazing cars.""
So far, the mother robot needs about ten minutes to design, build and test a baby robot it produced.
The scientists hope they could eventually use a computer simulation to pre-select the best robot designs and use real models for actual testing.",'% robot%'

As China's population declines, experts are calling for more research into artificial intelligence, big data and smart manufacturing to maintain an economic and industrial edge and to drive development.
China's rapid development means it's no longer unusual to see fixed robot arms working around the clock, performing simple, highly repetitive tasks, such as welding and moving components on a typical production line.
For the factories, robots make good employees; they work long hours, don't claim wages and never complain. Meanwhile, for an aging China, with its declining birth rate, robots, particularly the industrial kind, may offer a solution to a looming labor shortage that could potentially drag down economic growth over the long term.
The expected population shortfall has prompted widespread concerns that China will be over the hill before attaining its goal of becoming the world's leading economy. In response, the central government has relaxed the three-decades-old family planning policy that restricted most couples to one child.
Lu Jiehua, professor of sociology at Peking University, ruled out the possibility that the new policy will be the game changer that reverses the population decline, citing a change in public attitudes toward reproduction and family size.
By April, only 1.37 million of the 11 million couples eligible to have a second child had filed an application, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.
Official statistics showed that China's potential workforce, people ages 16 to 59, peaked around 2011, and has been in decline since. At the same time, the number of people working has been declining as a proportion of total population.
Last year, there were 916 million people between the ages of 16 and 59 in China, roughly 66 percent of the entire population. The proportion hit a peak of 74.5 percent in 2010, and has been falling ever since.
Lu's perception that robots offer a relatively simple solution to the problem is shared by other experts, such as Wang Weiming, deputy director of the Equipment Department at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
""The development of the robotics industry will solve the labor shortage in China efficiently, thus reducing labor costs for manufacturing industry,"" Wang said, adding that skilled workers only account for 13 percent of national employment, resulting in a shortfall of 33 million people.
Despite the fact that manufacturers are offering ever higher salaries, the majority of young people are unwilling to engage in labor-intensive occupations.
An industrial robot, however, can do the work of an average six skilled workers on two shifts on a production line.",'% robot%'

A newly developed robot journalist ""Dreamwriter"" published its first news story on the website of China's internet giant Tencent on Thursday, according to Beijing Times.
The article, titled “August CPI a new high in the past 12 months” written by the news-writing robot, is no different in quality from reports by human journalists, as it quoted data from officials from National Statistics Bureau and analysis by experts.
However, the robot made a mistake about the expert’s gender. Some media professionals think that the robot can only write hard news but not in-depth or feature stories.
Equipped with high speed calculating and information searching ability, the robot can write a piece of thousands-word news just in one minute.
Human journalists’ advantage is that they can explain a concept in a more easily understandable way. A story written by a human journalist writes that it will cost people one more yuan to buy scrambled egg with tomato as CPI in August rose by 2 per cent.
Tencent stated that the robot will not take place of human journalists. They hope the robot can free human journalists so that they can do more challenging and intelligent works.",'% robot%'

""I will take him to the Forbidden City,"" Yang, who works for Japanese semiconductor manufacturer Renesas Electronics, said.
Back in 2002, Yang was sent to Japan for training, and Iwao was his supervisor. ""He took me out in his spare time and showed me around,"" Yang recalled. Before he left, Iwao gave his Chinese colleague gifts.
Yang grew up listening to his grandfather's stories about his time as a soldier during China's War against Japanese Aggression. This colored his opinion of the country.
""Had I been told that Renesas was a Japanese company, I might not have accepted the job,"" he admitted. Gradually, however, he discovered that the Japanese people were not as he had imagined. ""I have visited Japan more than ten times,"" he said. ""I found the people to be mostly polite, friendly and diligent.""
LOVE THY NEIGHBOR
China and Japan, although sharing many similarities, have a fractious relationship. Confucianism and Buddhism travelled to Japan from China, and even the characters used in Japanese are derived from the Chinese script.
Although these shared cultural characteristics have led to many Chinese having an affinity toward their eastern neighbor, the eight-year Sino-Japanese war has left a scar in the hearts of Chinese.
Ma Jiangang's uncle died fighting the Japanese Imperialist Army in the 1940s. Ma, 58, however, does not hate Japan because of this.
On the contrary, he has great memories of watching the Japanese movies and TV dramas of the 1980s, the honeymoon period between China and Japan following the normalization of diplomatic relations in 1972.
He also liked Japanese electronic appliances. ""Everyone wanted a Japanese color television,"" he recalled. His first TV was Hitachi.
In the 1990s, however, Ma's feelings changed due to the rise of the Diaoyu Islands dispute. His daughter Huixin went through a similar change.
""I hate their leaders' visiting the Yasukuni Shrine [where war criminals are worshipped] and the denial of the Nanjing Massacre,"" said the 34-year-old civil servant.
A joint poll by ""China Daily"" and the Japanese non-profit think tank Genron NPO last year showed that 86.8 percent of the Chinese viewed Japan unfavorably, while 93 percent of Japanese had a negative impression of China, the worst since 2005.
TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN
At the same time, however, the two countries seem to be inseparable.
China is Japan's largest trading partner. In 2014, China provided 22.3 percent of Japan's imports. More than 23,500 Japanese enterprises have invested in China.
However hard she tried, it was not easy for Ma Huixin to eliminate all the Japanese elements from her life. Her son liked Japanese animations. Her family recently watched the movie ""Doraemon: Stand by Me"". The blue cat-like robot was part of the mother's childhood memories, too.
Yang Haihui said that at least one of every 10 automobiles that roll off production lines in China used chips produced by his company.
Perhaps Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, east China, is a place where anti-Japan sentiment is highest. The Rape of Nanking massacre in the winter of 1937 left at least 300,000 people dead at the hands of the Japanese. The death toll has never been officially recognized by Japan.
Taxi driver Wu Qifeng in Nanjing has a rule: Never carry Japanese. Once he discovered that two of his three passengers were Japanese, he stopped the cab immediately. ""I ordered them to get out,"" he said. ""In Nanjing, I am not the only driver to do so.""
In the shopping malls, however, Japanese cosmetics still line the shelves, and books by Japanese authors are also available. ""There are always people asking me 'why are there Japanese cars on the roads of Nanjing',""Wu said. He felt ashamed.
The situation was no different in Japan.
Xinhua interviewed three Japanese: A 41-year-old civil servant, a 27-year-old lawyer and a 52-year-old manager. They expressed a preference for Chinese cuisine, trust in traditional Chinese medicine and good impressions of clothes and electrical appliances made in China.
""But if I had the choice, I would only eat food made in Japan, because I always see reports of bad food quality in China,"" said the manager.
LOOKING FORWARD
Many Chinese, especially the young, have tried to embrace Japan.
Han Feng likes Japan. She watches Japanese movies, and buys Japanese brands.
""I even visited the Yasukuni Shrine, but the overt denial of aggression just made me really angry,"" she said. Han is from northeast China, where the Japanese set up the puppet regime Manchukuo.
""We really want to let go of the past,"" said Jiang Yicong, 22, whose great grandfather led the No. 19 Army against the Japanese in Shanghai. ""But if they stop the attempt to temper with history, we could get on much better.""
Last month, three Japanese cabinet ministers and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's wife visited the Yasukuni Shrine. In July, Japan's Lower House passed a controversial security bill that would give the Self-Defense Force a greater role worldwide; this is a violation of the country's post-war constitution.
Despite these trying circumstances, the people of both countries never stopped moving closer to each other.
By April 2013, 60 percent of Japan's international students were from China. Similarly, Japan was China's fourth biggest foreign student origin country.
Yano Koji first came to China in the early 2000s to study Chinese, and is now one of the most popular Japanese actors in China.
At first, he played many Japanese soldiers -- the archetypal ""bad guys"".
Gradually he was accepted by the Chinese audience, and now has tens of thousands of fans. He also has a Chinese wife and a daughter.
""As an actor, I am a conduit,"" he said. ""Everyone who works between China and Japan could be a channel, and we could unite to make a difference, so that in spite of politics, the exchanges between Chinese and Japanese people continue.""
Chinese director Lu Chuan was glad to see his movie ""City of Life and Death"" (2009) shown by Japan's largest online video platform niconico.jp. The film focuses on the Nanjing Massacre.
When the film was shown four years ago in a cinema in Tokyo, more than 40 police officers and several police cars safeguarded the event in case right-wing extremists caused trouble, Lu recalled.
The screening was a good start, Lu said, adding that he hoped the people from China and Japan could have more exchanges ""to understand each other better.""
Yang Haihui observed that in Japan, elderly people who knew the war better tend to be more friendly toward China than the younger generation.
""There might be many people in both countries who were like me in the past: disliking each other but without really knowing each other,"" he said.
A book written by Chinese TV host Bai Yansong, who made a program about Japan several years ago, reads: ""Love or hatred, put it aside [...] Understand each other first. With enough understanding, everything is possible.""",'% robot%'

A robot was hitherto regarded as a cold body with a cool mind, to be used at assembly lines, warehouses, mines, and even at homes to perform simple tasks like vacuum-cleaning and laundry.
Such machines have now evolved into ""intellectual robots"". They find application in various sectors, including security, medical services and aerospace.
That's not all. They can replace human beings as teachers, coaches and therapists. And, even as sex partners.
But what really impresses me the most is the robot journalist. Since last July, newswire Associated Press, in association with startup Automated Insights, has been ""employing"" a robot to produce corporate earnings stories.
The US media used to write around 300 such stories each quarter. Now, it can automate about 3,000, each typically containing 150 to 300 words. AP also uses robotic technology to provide sports news.
Following the success of media giants such as AP and The New York Times in developed markets, home-grown Tencent Holdings has developed Dreamwriter last month, which can produce a piece of hard business news within minutes.
Dreamwriter appears to be bad news to my fellow journalists and me. I wonder if our future job prospects are at risk.

Ten-year strategy includes increased use of locally made IT hardware in key sectors
Ten priority industries were identified on Tuesday by a key committee advising the central government on its ""Made in China 2025"" plan to upgrade the country's manufacturing sector.
The plan is aimed at moving the country away from low-end manufacturing to more value-added output.
The consultative committee's list includes new information technologies, numerically controlled machines and robots, aerospace devices, ocean engineering and shipping, and advanced rail equipment.
New energy vehicles, electrical equipment, agricultural machines, advanced materials, and biological medicine and medical instruments are also listed.
The committee will update the list every two years.
The State Council, China's Cabinet, unveiled the Made in China 2025 plan in May, in which domestic manufacturers are expected to make technological breakthroughs in emerging industries.
Xin Guobin, director of a 3-month-old office under the State Council that aims to spearhead the plan, said the guidance will play a vital role in increasing the country's manufacturing ability. Future industry policies will be implemented based on this guidance, Xin said.
The most eye-catching target is the greatly increased market share for Chinese servers.
The country is aiming for a 90 percent market share for domestic servers in the finance and telecommunications sectors by 2025.
Analysts said the target is designed to further squeeze the markets of overseas vendors such as IBM Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co.
China has never set out to oust imported IT hardware in the government procurement sector. But IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems Inc and many other technology giants are feeling the pain from a tightened grip on data security standards and checks. These companies did not immediately comment.
State-owned banks and telecom carriers are the biggest buyers of servers.
Chinese vendors only provide low-and midlevel products, with overseas companies catering to high-end demands.
The plan aims to increase the market share of domestic servers to 75 percent by 2020.
Chen Shanzhi, a member of the committee who was involved in setting the targets, said wider use of locally made IT hardware in key industries will help secure data safety.
""It will be a comprehensive project to keep our data safe. The country will try out more homemade servers, storage, operating systems and other basic software products in coming years.""
Chen also said the market share of domestically manufactured basic software products in the finance and telecom sectors would increase to about 75 percent in 10 years. Local software makers have less than 50 percent of the market today.
But Wu Lianfeng, associate vice-president of industry consultancy IDC China, said it is virtually impossible for banks and telecom carriers to solely purchase servers produced by Chinese vendors because of the technology gap.
""A practical way of doing this is to make overseas multinationals join hands with local vendors and produce products that comply with Chinese regulations,"" Wu said.",'% robot%'

It was one of the many interesting interactions Li shared with hundreds of startup entrepreneurs at the opening of a weeklong event on innovation and entrepreneurship in Beijing.
Li made an impromptu speech encouraging the innovators and strolled among booths to hear their entrepreneurial stories and ask about the development of their businesses.
He pledged to leverage mass innovation to shake off excess capacity in traditional industries while pressing ahead with emerging sectors, such as high-value-added manufacturing and services.
""I wasn't planning to make speeches today, but I'm over-whelmed by the enthusiasm of the innovators. People in their own day have different heroes. Innovators are the heroes of our time,"" Li said.

Li also said the trend of starting one's own businesses was a fairway to improve one's living condition in China.

Rising costs from labor, energy saving and emission controls have squeezed manufacturing industry profits, leading to economic slowdown in the coastal economic powerhouse, which has prospered through export-oriented industries in past decades.
""We believe it is prime time to develop a robotics industry cluster in Kunshan by taking advantage of its industrial foundation,"" said Gan Zhongxue, a founding director of ABB Corporate Research Robot.
ABB is a world leader in power and automation. It relocated its global robotics headquarters to Shanghai in 2005 with an eye on China's rapidly growing robot market.
Gan said China has developed industrial chains for both manufacturing robots and intelligent robots.
At Foxconn's plant in Kunshan, more than 2,000 automated mechanical arms have been installed this year. Each industrial robot can substitute for the labor of three people in the workshop.
Yang Ming of Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group said the robots in its plant in Kunshan Wusongjiang Industrial Park can work 24 hours a day and have yielded direct economic returns of up to 300 million yuan.
Foxconn, supplier to some of the world's biggest tech brands, including Apple, is known for its gigantic labor-intensive factories in China, each employing tens of thousands of workers to assemble high-precision electronic gadgets such as iPhones.
The consultative committee advising the Chinese government on the ""Made in China 2025"" plan to upgrade the country's manufacturing sector proposed robotics in manufacturing as one of 10 priority industries on Tuesday.
The plan unveiled in May encourages domestic manufacturers to make technological breakthroughs in emerging industries in order to shift the country from low-end manufacturing to more value-added production.
Facing headwinds brought on by economic transfer, China's manufacturing industry has been under pressure to increase automation
There are 40 robotics industrial bases like Kunshan in China. Since 2014, robotics firms have opened at a pace of nearly one new firm per day.
Statistics released by the China Robot Industry Alliance (CRIA) show that the sales volume of China's industrial robots grew 58.9 percent year on year on average from 2009 to 2014, and the domestic sales of robots in 2014 reached 57,000 units, making the country the world's largest robot producer for two consecutive years since 2013.
In addition to the manufacturing sector, China's mining, petrochemical, coal and fireworks companies have been encouraged to use more robots and automatic equipment for dangerous jobs to reduce safety incidents.
In the service sector, the demand for robotics is also robust, with robots used in restaurants, shops, and nursing homes across the country. Home service robots are seen as a future trend for helping take care of the elderly as the senior population grows, with people age 60 or over reaching 212 million, or 15.5 percent of the total.
However, China still lags behind in the world's leading robot production technology. Chinese firms mainly assemble imported key components for robotics, said Xing Fei, deputy director of Nanjing Robotics Research Institute.
Xu Jianguo, director of the Shanghai Association of Robotics, said there are bubbles in the robotic sector. Many companies were set up in order to take advantage of favorable government policies such as land use and tax breaks given to boost the technology.
Industry insiders proposed the government set up an industry entrance threshold to better regulate the robot industry and establish a financial platform to help turn high-tech robotic research and innovation into commercial development.",'% robot%'

“We should look to the future beyond the International Space Station,” Woener said to the BBC, “We should look for a smaller spacecraft in low-Earth orbit for microgravity research and I propose a Moon village on the far side of the Moon.”
“A Moon village shouldn’t just mean some houses, a church and a town hall,” says Woerner. “This Moon village should mean partners from all over the world contributing to this community with robotic and astronaut missions and support communication satellites.”
Woerner sees the moon as a place to bridge Earthly problems. He also invited China to join the Moon village plan. He envisions the Moon village having astronauts, Russian cosmonauts, and Chinese taikonauts.

This occurrence could not have come at a better time. Germany and France have both been China’s comprehensive strategic partners for many years. However, never before have our respective partnerships with China been more relevant to addressing pressing issues not only in Europe and Asia but well beyond. No other two countries in the world coordinate their policies more closely than France and Germany in particular within the European Union.
Our action on climate today will determine our common future
France and Germany are convinced that the world has to gradually engage on the path of a deep decarbonization.
In December, Paris will host the COP21 Conference, which will define the international framework of action to reconcile everyone’s aspiration to prosperity with the natural limits of our planet. Our goal is to build together a Paris Alliance for Climate enabling us to limit the planet’s average temperature rise to less than 2ºC above pre-industrial levels.
So far 149 countries, among them China, have presented their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), which specify national efforts to mitigate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These contributions, coming from developed as well as developing countries, represent more than 87% of world GES emissions. Even if these efforts are probably not sufficient to put the world on the track of a 2°C rise of the temperature, they are the sign of the firm determination of the international community to have a universal agreement adopted in Paris. However, it is clear that to win the battle against climate disruption, we all will have to gradually increase our level of ambition.
World crises challenge the global order
France and Germany are key players in the quest for solutions to several of the world’s most dangerous crises.
The situation in Ukraine has brought confrontation with Russia and the very real risk of falling back into patterns of the Cold War. The effects have been felt in the region but also in Asia. Germany and France are driving the discussions with Ukraine and Russia in the so-called Normandy format. We welcome China’s support to find a political solution.
The disastrous civil war in Syria and the terrorist onslaught especially by ISIS on Syria, Iraq and other countries are not just a regional problem, they are a challenge to humankind as a whole. The advance of terrorism in the Middle East with its ensuing instability makes itself felt in Europe and Asia. We share common concerns regarding the deteriorating situation in Syria. With a view to finding a political solution and to addressing the huge humanitarian crisis and its root causes we both encourage China to play an active and positive part, in line with the UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura’s efforts.
These are but two examples on a much longer list of hotspots which all need cooperation between France, Germany and China. Sustainable development will be a key. France and Germany welcome President Xi’s commitments in New York on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations both on development and security and to the United Nations Charter, which enshrines the equality of all nations, big and small.
Key economic and technological partners
France and Germany are both founding members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Not only that: Our combined capital contribution of around 8% makes us by far the strongest non-Asian partner. We coordinate amongst ourselves closely and are looking forward to the bank’s first projects based on strong governance.
China supports a strong and prosperous European Union, its first trading partner in the world. France and Germany acted in close coordination to find an acceptable outcome to the Greek crisis and to restore confidence in the Euro. For both our countries, the European unification process and the Euro are non-reversible. We will further step up cooperation with China to promote the internationalization of the Renminbi.
Looking at the Chinese economy, we are confident that China continues to have enormous potential for growth, which will be unlocked in the coming years if China commits itself vigorously to further opening up and market-oriented reforms, including in the state sector. In this perspective, France and Germany fully support the negotiations towards an ambitious and truly comprehensive Sino-European bilateral agreement on investment.
China’s success will depend crucially on technological upgrading. Germany and France combined probably are China’s most important international partners in its modernization drive. Roughly 200 billion Euros in trade with China in 2014 marked a new record, almost four times as much as China’s trade with any other EU country. We are leaders in sectors which are crucial to China’s “Made in China 2025” blueprint for innovation. Germany has its “industry 4.0.” and France its “industry of the future”, covering a wide range of key areas from next generation of transportation to the internet of things, including machine tools, robotics, business software, high-tech chemicals, medicine for the future, digital safety, data economy, healthy and customized food. And we do not only trade but build up manufacturing, research and development within China. Airbus for example has moved faster than any competitor to move manufacturing and development to China.
Our partnerships will endure
Our partnerships with China go far beyond the political and economic sphere. Today, many more Chinese are studying French or German and visit our countries, and vice versa than only a few years ago. Almost 20.000 young French and German students are studying in China, holding the two top spots amongst EU nationals. When it comes to learning foreign languages and studying or working abroad, the Chinese saying - which has its exact corollary in both French and German - “not to put all eggs into the same basket” is a particularly wise tenet. Our strategic partnerships with China are here to stay and will continue to flourish.

BEIJING, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- Rather than adding to pure optimism, fresh official data released Thursday painted a realistic picture of the world's second largest economy that is slower in expansion but steady in reforms.
China posted weaker-than-expected growth in key economic indicators in the first eight months of this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
Industrial output, a gauge of the activity of large enterprises, grew 6 percent year on year in August, down from the 6.4-percent pace a month earlier and retreating to the lowest level this year. Fixed asset investment fell short of expectations with a 7.8-percent rise in the January-August period, the weakest since 1999.
Retail sales rose 10.1 percent last month, lower than market estimates of 10.5 percent and July's 10.4-percent rate. Private investment and property sales also registered slower growth.
Thursday's data came after a strong economic rebound that features forecast-beating GDP expansion in the first two quarters and aroused concerns over the growth impetus of the economy.
Bloomberg chief Asia economist Tom Orlik said in an e-mail that the data showed ""a slightly sharper-than-expected loss of momentum,"" adding that headwinds against the economy are significant.
""China still faces lurking problems and challenges"" from external uncertainties and domestic transformation, NBS spokesperson Liu Aihua said at a press conference, but dismissed worries that the lackluster performance will linger for the remainder of the year.
""Short-term volatility can be triggered by non-economic factors, such as weather and comparison bases, and does not represents the overall trend,"" Liu said, adding that high temperatures and more rainfall disrupted factory activity this summer.
Employment was stable and inflation was under control. The surveyed unemployment rate in 31 cities was under 5 percent last month and consumer prices rose 1.8 percent. Industrial enterprises saw their profits improve substantially in the first seven months.
""The economy still stayed within a reasonable range,"" Liu said, predicting stability in the second half. China has targeted an annual economic growth of around 6.5 percent for 2017, down from the 6.7 percent pace recorded in 2016.
The NBS data also pointed to solid progress in the country's economic rebalancing and industrial upgrades.
With old growth engines losing steam, China is pressing forward with a new model of economic development that draws strength from consumption, services sector and innovation.
Services maintained rapid expansion in August, with revenues of information and rental services logging double-digit growth.
Investment into high-tech sectors jumped 19.5 percent in the first eight months, while the environmental protection industry saw investment up by 28.2 percent.
The output of industrial robots surged 63 percent in the January-August period, and 25 percent more new energy vehicles rolled off assembly lines.
""In the details, there were some positives for China's reform and rebalancing story, with most of the slowdown in production coming from investment and output of old-line industries,"" Orlik said.
China has made headway in downsizing saturated sectors. Around 128 million tonnes of excess coal capacity was eliminated during the January-July period, while shoddy steel products were banned.
Economic adjustments continued with improvements in quality and efficiency, Liu said.",'% robot%'

WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 -- Using rubbery materials, scientists at the University of Houston have successfully created a new form of stretchable electronics that holds promise in health monitors, medical implants and artificial skins.
In a paper published this week in the journal Science Advances, the researchers described ""a completely new strategy"" to develop electronic materials that can be stretchable and in format similar to rubbers.
""Conventional electronics materials, especially semiconductors, are brittle and non-stretchable. To enable mechanical stretchability, a 'structure engineering' strategy of creating mechanical architectures, such as wavy, serpentine, kirigami, etc., have generally been employed,"" said author Cunjiang Yu, assistant professor at the University of Houston, who led the study.
""However, such a strategy is associated with complex structure design and fabrication, reduced structural stability, and high cost,"" said Yu.
In their work, Yu and his team developed a naturally stretchable rubber nanocomposite made from all elastomeric materials, including silicone rubber and organic semiconducting nano-fibrils.
On this basis, rubbery transistors -- a fundamental building block for circuits -- and rubbery sensors capable of measuring strain, pressure and temperature have been successfully fabricated. Lab testing showed that they remained functional while stretched by 50 percent.
""Our strategy has the advantages in simple fabrication, scalable manufacturing, high-density device integration, large strain tolerance, robustness, and low cost,"" said Yu.
To illustrate some of the promising applications, the researchers explored use of their sensors as smart skins for robots by incorporating them onto a glove to enable sign language translation.
A temperature sensing skin implemented on the robot hand also detected the temperature of cups filled with hot or cold water.
""Such a class of rubbery electronics and sensors represent the drastic advancements in electronic materials and soft stretchable electronics, and will impact the future development in soft wearable electronics and a broad range of application areas,"" Yu said.",'% robot%'

The guideline, jointly issued by the country’s Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MHRCS), and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), predicted that the shortfall will further expand to 4.5 million by 2025.
“Automated production is not to merely replace workers with robots, but to introduce more skilled operators of the machines,” said Wang Xiwen, director of a smart manufacturing institute under the MIIT.
The scarcity of highly skilled technicians has become a barrier for the transformation and upgrading of China’s manufacturing industry, he added.
“The development of enterprises has been seriously hindered by the inadequate skills of robot operators,” said Wu Bin, general manager of a factory engaged in the manufacturing of precise instruments based in Dongguan, Guangdong province.
Technical upgrades have never been a problem for Wu in the past decade, but the man is now worried about recruitment.
Statistics show that the number of professionals in Chinese manufacturing enterprises above the designated size only account for less than 10% of the country’s working population. In addition, the number of highly-skilled personnel with a master degree or above only makes up 2% of the total.
According to Su Hainan, vice president of the Chinese Association for Labor Studies, industrial environment, educational system, salary system, and social traditions all contribute to the improvement of labor force skills.
“The insufficient number of qualified technicians is the main reason for the recruitment problem,” Su said.
On the other hand, frontier jobs in workshops are not the first choice for most of the highly-skilled professionals.
A fresh graduate from Quanzhou College of Technology named Wang Xiaofu told Xinhua News Agency that most of his classmates would rather be engaged in marketing than to be working in a factory, believing that being a worker is an unpromising job.
Related departments have made plans to improve the ratio of highly educated personnel in manufacturing to 22% by 2020, and the highly skilled employees will make up to 28% of the total labor force.
However, to fill the three million shortfall in three years is not an easy task. Experts believe that enhancing the education of skilled technicians is the key to solving this problem.

GENEVA, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Ten years on from the global financial crisis, the prospects for a sustained economic recovery remain at risk due to a widespread failure to put in place reforms necessary to underpin competitiveness and bring about much-needed increases in productivity, warned the World Economic Forum (WEF) in its report on Wednesday.
Drawing on data going back 10 years, the Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018 highlights in particular three areas of greatest concern. These include the financial system, where levels of ""soundness"" have yet to recover from the shock of 2007 and in some parts of the world are declining further.
Another key finding is that competitiveness is enhanced, not weakened, by combining degrees of flexibility within the labour force with adequate protection of workers' rights. With vast numbers of jobs set to be disrupted as a result of automation and robotization, creating conditions that can withstand economic shock and support workers through transition periods will be vital.
The WEF's data also suggests that the reason innovation often fails to ignite productivity is due to an imbalance between investments in technology and efforts to promote its adoption throughout the wider economy.
The WEF's Global Competitiveness Report is an annual assessment of the factors driving productivity and prosperity.

Luo Jun, CEO of the world's 3D printing Technology Industry Alliance, said during the third World 3D Printing Technology Conference & Expo.
Held in Chengdu, capital city in southwest China's Sichuan province, from June 4 to 5, the conference focuses on the 3rd generation of 3D printing. More than 1,200 delegates from over 10 countries and regions are taking part. Luo Jun predicts that the number of professional visitors will exceed 30,000.
""The Chinese government has just issued Made in China 2025"", said Luo. ""This is a document that looks forward to the future of China's manufacturing industry in 2025. The overall environment for 3D printing is improving fast, and prospects for the industry have never looked brighter.""
He pointed out that the global value of 3D printing reached 30 billion yuan last year, and China accounted for 10 percent of this total. In recent years China's government has placed 3D printing, together with robotics and artificial intelligence, at the forefront of technological development in the field of intelligent manufacturing. In the first half of this year, the government issued two important documents to promote the development of 3D printing industry.
At a news conference during the Expo, Bill O'Neill, Director of Cambridge Industrial Photonics Center, pointed out that 3D printing technology has been in existence for more than 30 years. But problems in adapting it to practical applications meant that for a long time it had remained an interesting phenomenon of limited commercial use.
Luo Jun confirmed the problem: ""Although 3D printing could be used on a wide range of products, it was not a commercially viable substitute for existing production methods as it was not suitable for mass production. We lacked a mature business model which could integrate 3D printing into industries like fashion, art, education, and training.""
Experts believe that the 3D printing must integrate with big data, cloud computing, networking, artificial intelligence, digital control technology and other advanced technologies. Ian Gibson, Professor of Machine Design at Deakin University in Australia, also pointed out that 3D printing has great potential in niche segments of major industries such as automobile production, aerospace, and biotechnology.
Following the Second World Conference & Expo of 3D printing in Qingdao in 2014 , the China Innovation Center of 3D Printing, the 3D Printing Research Institute, and several companies involved in online 3D printing set up in Qingdao's National High-tech Zone. They will be fully open in late June this year, providing a solid cluster as a base for the development of the 3D printing industry.

Helen Qiao, Chief Economist for Greater China, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch moderated a panel with Feng Deng, founder of Northern Light Venture Capital, Jean Liu, President, DiDi Chuxing, and
Shoucheng Zhang, founder of Danhua Capital and professor of physics, Stanford University talking about China’s entrepreneurship.
Helen Qiao said that “China has become a pure capital importer to an exporter, that’s really something phenomenal.” She said that “Made in China” in the past was labeled as something equivalent as lower-quality consumer products. That’s changing. China now is on the edge of smart phones, PCs, not mention robotics, and other technologies and interesting ideas.
She asked Deng about the opportunities lying in China’s transition from a manufacturing based and heavily investment-driven economy to a more service-based economy, as well as a consumption-driven economy. Deng said that he can identify three specific areas: consumption, Internet Plus and online education.
He said that with the goring middle class, Chinese people’s lifestyles have changed. He took the high-speed railway as an example: when the high-speed railway was debut, people doubted that whether it could have passengers because rich people may take airplanes while poor people may take slower-speed trans. However, three years after the launch of the high-speed railway, people rushed to buy second-class the coach. Another two years Later, people found that it was difficult to get the first-class seats. “That’s a very good indication that middle class people has started to change to live a high quality life. Consumer spending during the last five years are growing. Although the economy is going down , the consumption power is not.”
A wave of start-ups has swept China after Chinese Premier Li called for efforts to boost mass innovation and entrepreneurship. “Internet plus traditional industry is one of the most renowned innovation in China,” said Jean Liu, “Didi is an example.” She said that Didi cooperated with Lyft, a San Francisco-based car-sharing company. If people have the Dili App, they can use here directly in the United States. “Even People’s cannot speak English, they can still use Lyft here.”
That’s one of collaborations between China and the United States. Professor Shoucheng Zhang said that mass innovation in China now has very positive effect. People are dedicated to entrepreneurship and they keep learning. “I think we could have some collaborations in some areas, such as AR and VR.” Entrepreneurs could do manufacturing in China, seek investment in China and find markets in Silicon Valley.
The 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit is predicted to attract about 15,000 attendees during the three days. The event provided an opportunity for entrepreneurs from around the world to hear from successful Silicon Valley CEOs, meet investors, and connect with government resources.
At today’s opening ceremony, John Kerry asked all the entrepreneurs to consider three ""generational challenges"" when starting their business. The world is moving faster than ever, he said, and we won’t be able to keep up without the contributions of this generation’s entrepreneurs.
He said that educational tools could help reach the young, disenfranchised youth around the world who may be at risk of being radicalized. Green startups could help the public and private sector switch to a low-carbon and low-emissions economy. And software that tracks money and accountability might cut down on corruption.
Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky also attended the event and shared their views about their own business. Travis Kalanick even explained Uber’s resistance toward using fingerprint criminal background checks, saying it is a system that keeps innocent and reformed individuals out of the workforce while also making it slower for the company to add more drivers.

The slowdown of the world's second-largest economy deepened in 2015 Q1, prompting calls for further policy easing. However, there were signs that the economy is gradually becoming better balanced.
SLOWING GROWTH
China's economy grew 7 percent year on year in Q1, down from 7.3 percent in 2014 Q4. This growth, the lowest quarterly growth rate since 2009, was in line with the 2015 ""around 7 percent"" target.
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported that growth in industrial output, fixed asset investment and retail sales in March all slowed and were below economists' expectations.
All key headline numbers and components of GDPweakened in Q1, reflecting persistent downward pressure on the economy, UBS economist Wang Tao said.
The ongoing property downturn and staggering exports outweighed a modest Q1 cushioning from solid infrastructure investment and resilient consumption, Wang said.
Wednesday's data is the latest in a string of numbers that suggest further weakness in the economy.
Export data for March, released on Monday, tumbled from a year earlier, due to sluggish global demand. Import shipments also shrank sharply.
Consumer inflation also remained tepid in March, while producer prices stayed in deflationary territory.
Premier Li Keqiangsaid on Tuesday that the government should make efficient use of policy tools to maintain growth, promote employment and raise efficiency.
This week, the World Bank trimmed its forecast for China's growth this year from 7.2 percent to 7.1 percent.
DESIRABLE OUTCOME
Despite the slowdown, the economy is still one of the world's fastest growing and enjoys sound fundamentals as the healthy pace of job creation and income growth continue, analysts said.
NBS spokesperson Sheng Laiyun said Q1 economic growth was within a ""reasonable range"" and the slowdown was within expectation.
A ""new normal"" of slower growth is a desirable outcome as China seeks to wean the economy off its reliance on exports and state-directed investment, and instead encourage private sector growth and consumer spending to ensure sustainable expansion in the long run.
Progress has been made to shift to a more balanced and greener economy.
The service sector accounted for 51.6 percent of GDP in Q1, up from 48.2 percent in 2014 and 46.9 percent in 2013. Energy consumption per unit GDP continued to fall, recording a drop of 5.6 percent in Q1, after last year's 4.8 percent decline.
Thanks to efforts to cut red tape, simplify administrative procedures and cultivate new growth engines, newly registered companies mushroomed and high-tech industries blossomed.
The number of newly registered companies surged 38.4 percent in Q1,while new energy automobiles and robotics saw industrial output gain more than 50 percent during the same period.
AMPLE AMMUNITION
Policy makers have repeatedly stated that the country has the firepower to avert a hard landing, and should the slowdown cause widespread unemployment or a drop in citizens' incomes, it would not hesitate to intervene.
Analysts expect the central bank, which has cut interest rates twice since November and once lowered the amount of cash the banks must hold as reserves, to roll out more policy easing measures.
Additional action is needed to contain pressure and to ensure the economy continues to run within a ""reasonable range"", according to Wang Tao.
Potential measures may include the acceleration of infrastructure projects, cutting benchmark interest rates, increasing liquidity provision or speeding up pro-growth reforms, she said.
Bob Liu, an analyst at the China International Capital Corp., expects the central bank to cut the benchmark interest rate once, and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) six times this year. Barclays economist Chang Jian forecast one interest rate cut in Q2 and two RRR cuts.
Wang expects supportive polices to buttress real activity in Q2/Q3, helping GDP growth back up to 7.1 percent in Q2. However, she added, any revival will be hard to sustain if the property downturn, the biggest drag on growth, continues to intensify to the end of the year.
To avoid a sharper slowdown, policy makers have unveiled supportive measures, including relaxed home purchasing rules and more investment in major infrastructure projects.
Longer-term development plans include further reform and three major strategies -- the Belt and Road initiative, coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and development of the Yangtze River economic belt. All of which are designed to unleash growth potential.
Sheng Laiyun expressed confidence that China will maintain stable and healthy growth, adding that the economy has the potential and condition to maintain a medium-high level of growth.
Ongoing industrialization, urbanization, agricultural modernization and digitalization will be the major source of growth momentum for the economy, Sheng said. When combined with macro-economic control measures, the official said, the economy is poised to maintain stable and heathy development..",'% robot%'

The report noted that by 2013 China had become the world's largest consumer market for industrial robots, and the number of robots used in China will reach 428,000 by 2017, making China the largest robot user in the world. At the same time, China itself is actively cultivating domestic robot manufacturers.
Robots promotion -
Create more jobs
The research and development, manufacturing and application of robots is an important gauge of a country's level of technological innovation and high-end manufacturing.
The latest market research report by IFR claims that the global robot market will show double-digit growth in the next few years.
ABB Group points out that China currently has just 30 robots per 10,000 workers employed in manufacturing industries. In contrast, the US robot usage is five times more than China, and Germany's 10 times more. IFR believes that the use of robots has not increased unemployment, but will create more jobs on the whole. The one million robots “on duty” have created three million jobs in the world, and will create one million more in the next five years.
Remain competitive -
Need to vigorously promote production automation
Gudrun Litzenberger, general secretary of IFR, said that automation is the key to improving productivity and promoting energy saving. China is the world's largest and fastest-growing consumer market, and the huge middle class has a growing demand for consumer goods, medical services and high-quality life. The automation trends in manufacturing industry will drive an increasing investment in China's robotics industry.
Colin Angle, founder and CEO of the U.S. largest robot manufacture iRobot, noted that China has a rapidly growing robot market. To remain competitive in manufacturing industry, Chinese enterprises need to vigorously promote production automation. China has proven robot manufacturing techniques and requirements, which is why iRobot chose China as a production base, said Angle.
Achieve big leap -
Promote the transition to a high value-added manufacturing industry
The British ""Economist"" magazine recently commented that the Chinese government is clearly aware that a high-end and high value-added manufacturing industry is needed to deal with the current challenges.
China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has taken a series of supporting measures; the goal is to form a complete industrial system for industrial robots, and to make sure the high-end domestic robots can make up more than 45 percent of the market share by 2020.
Litzenberger pointed out that global robot makers will face fierce competition in the next few years. China's huge market potential has provided numerous possibilities for robot development.

357,peopleschina,2015-04-21 00:00:00.000000,2015,http://en.people.cn/n/2015/0421/c98649-8881394.html,"""World factory"" Dongguan is now experiencing a wave of machines replacing people. In 2014, statistics showed that 66 percent of 441 enterprises were using machines to replace workers, and 92 percent of enterprises interviewed confirmed that they would be expanding the number of machines in the next two years.
What advantages will this project bring to the companies involved? And are there any problems during the transfer?
Active creativity is the foundation for the development of any enterprise. To reduce costs, open new markets, and increase profit by relying on technical progress is becoming the choice of more and more companies. For cities like Dongguan, where labor-intensive industries gather, using machines to replace the labor force has been beneficial for many: companies become more efficient and profitable; their costs are reduced and competitiveness improves. Taking a knitwear mill as an example, it used to take one worker to control each machine during the production process, but now with the introduction of high-tech machines, one worker can control 8 fully-automatic computer-controlled facilities at the same time.
Though the project of replacing people with machines has made some progress, it is still necessary to direct attention to China's bottlenecks in technology, capital, and talent.
First of all, domestic capabilities in the production of high-end intelligent equipment are still insufficient. The machines that companies have introduced have mostly been imported from abroad. ""We really want to use some domestic robots and machines,"" said a manager of a manufacturing company. ""But imported equipment is more stable and accurate in production even though domestic products are very tempting in price.""
Second, professional technicians and researchers are also in short supply domestically. With the import of more high-tech machines, more professional technicians and researchers are also needed in the market. And the costs of ""replacing people with machines"" have consequently increased in part.
Moreover, to fully accomplish a project requires a great amount of investment, and it takes 2, 3 years or even longer to recover the costs. Should a market fall and orders dry up, a company can find itself with idle capacity. That risks trapping it in a vicious circle.
As a result, business should avoid blindly following suit in this replacement project, but comprehensively consider capabilities, capital, market, technical support, and other basic management factors before making any decision.

Representatives of Shanghai Yishijia Network Technology Co., Ltd filed a lawsuit against Apple and Shanghai Woshang Information technology Co., Ltd over the usage right of a trademark Yishijia owns on Apple's App Store, and are asking for compensation of more than 100 million yuan (about 16 million U.S. dollars), according to the Shanghai No.1 Intermediate People's Court. The court has accepted the lawsuit.
The dispute began in April, when Yishijia applied to upload the mobile application for Homevv, an online shopping platform that it developed, on the App Store, but was rejected by Apple as another app bearing the same trademark by Woshang was already there.
Yishijia, which has owned the trademark of Homevv since 2010, asked Apple to take Woshang's app off the store multiple times but was rejected.
Citing the loss of clients and market share, Yishijia demands that Apple remove Woshang's app from the App Store, and that Woshang stop using the trademark of Homevv. It also demands a public apology from the two companies.
Apple has faced a spate of lawsuits in China in recent years.

As industrialization progresses, China has become recognized as a major center for the global manufacturing industry. But increasing labor costs pose a problem for China's industry. Experts believe that developing intelligent manufacturing technology that focuses on industrial robots is essential. In the next 30 years, China’s robot market will grow by at least 30 percent.
Around the world, robots are mainly employed in the car and electronics industries. In China, they account for 80 percent of the workforce in the car industry.
Continuous growth of labor costs and labor shortages are the main incentives behind factories employing robots instead of people, according to Liu Changyong, vice dean of the research institute of Shenyang Xinsong Robot Automation Co. “Robots used to be very expensive. Companies would not consider using them. But in the past few years, prices have dropped by 4 percent every year.”
In 2013, China overtook Japan as the world’s largest robot market, purchasing 20 percent of the world’s robots.
Nevertheless, China’s domestic robot market is dominated by producers from Japan, Europe and the United States, while Chinese companies take less than 10 percent of total sales.
Despite its rapid growth, China’s robot technology still lags behind that of advanced countries, according to Zhao Jie, director of the Robot Research Institute of Harbin Institute of Technology.
Zhao Jie is concerned that rising demand for industrial robots might lead to cutthroat competition and duplicate construction of industrial parks among domestic enterprises.
In spite of these misgivings, some experts are optimistic about the robot industry. Cai Hegao, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and professor of the Harbin Institute of Technology said that Japan had gone through a similar process and has now formed several major robot enterprises through merger and acquisition. “The number of robots is too small in the manufacturing industry. I hope that after years of development, competent enterprises will prosper and promote the sound development of China’s industrial robot industry. ”

The three-day show kicked off on Wednesday, demonstrating latest achievements in the robot industry. (Xinhua/Ding Ting)
China seems ready to embrace the age of the robot, with exhibitors attending the three-day China International Robot Show, which started on Wednesday in Shanghai, expressing confidence in a thriving Chinese robotics industry.
The expo, encompassing some 16,000 square meters, attracted more than 200 companies from over 50 countries and regions. It is estimated that 60,000 visitors will attend the event, far outnumbering the 27,371 visitors tallied last year.
Many global heavyweights are taking part in this year's show, including Comau Group from Italy, Staubli Robotics of Switzerland and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd from Japan. The key industry players have brought their latest products to the show and are getting a lot of attention from interested Chinese buyers.
One of Comau's primary exhibits is the Racer 7-1.4 robot, which can perform a number of tasks, including arc welding, assembling and disassembling, sealing daily chemical products, sorting, removing, measuring and polishing.
According to Li Jing, marketing manager at Comau (Shanghai) Engineering Co Ltd, the company has received two orders for Racer so far, both from Chinese companies.
Japanese industry leader Kawasaki has also had a good response to its products this year. As a major supplier for automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp and Tianjin FAW Xiali Automobile Co Ltd, Kawasaki saw its China sales revenue double annually. The year 2013 was also extremely fruitful.
As Zhou Jianghua, sales manager of Kawasaki Robotics (Tianjin) Co Ltd Shanghai Branch, said, not just Kawasaki but the entire Chinese robotics industry is expected to grow by 20 percent a year through 2020.
""First, the ever-rising labor costs in China will make the country more reliant on robots,"" Zhou said. ""Second, it caters to the country's need of industrial upgrading, which indicates higher dependence on automation and precision. Third, the use of robots will guarantee the rate of finished products and thus enhance management efficiency.""
China became the largest robotics market last year with a total of 27,000 industrial robots being sold by overseas companies in the country, up 20 percent year-on-year, according to statistics provided by the International Federation of Robots in June.
According to the China Robot Industry Alliance, domestic companies sold more than 9,500 industrial robots in the country last year, which was three times the number sold a year earlier.
Noting the industry's rapid changes, Chinese authorities released a number of policies to further accelerate the transformation already taking place. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released guidelines for promoting the development of industrial robots in late December.
President Xi Jinping reiterated on Wednesday that the technical level and manufacturing capability of Chinese robots should be improved as soon as possible in order to take the lion's share of the market.
Local governments have also released similar plans to catch up with the trend. Zhejiang province, which is known for exports largely dependent on low-cost labor, announced that 36,000 local companies will be replacing human workers with machines by 2017. The annual investment is expected to be more than 300 billion yuan ($48 billion).",'% robot%'

The benchmark Nikkei 225 index gained 164.10 points to finish at 15,326.20 while the broader Topix index of all first-section issues added 13.52 points, or 1.07 percent, to close at 1,276.08.
The yen's retreat against the U.S. dollar and the results from the latest quarterly Tanken survey by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), along with some positive data from China, contributed to a positive market mood Tuesday, analysts here said, and investor appetite for riskier assets like stocks seems to have returned.
They pointed to the Tanken survey showing that business investments are charting a positive trajectory in light of the April tax hike and that large businesses are more willing to shell out on new equipment.
Large companies raised their combined investment plans for the continuing financial year ending March to a 7.4 percent increase from a previous 0.1 percent rise forecast in the March survey, the central bank's figures showed.
The latest figure, according to the BOJ, is the highest since the 2007 June survey, with large manufacturers likely to boost their investments to around 13 percent higher than initial median forecasts and marking the highest such investment rate since the Tanken in June 2006. ""There are still some positive numbers we can look at in the Tankan. Large companies raised their combined investment plans significantly for the continuing financial year ending March, with the new figure being the highest for some years,""said one local analyst.
On the back of improving industrial production, exports and retail sales, the latest data from China has also contributed to growing faith in the momentum of the world's second-largest economy, strategist here said, which inspired investors.
According to the official Purchasing Managers' Index, manufacturing activity increased to 51.0 in June from 50.8 in May, marking a six-month high, owing to an increase in both domestic and overseas orders. A reading over 50 shows an expansionary phase, whereas one under 50 shows contraction.
In addition the HSBC PMI index climbed to 50.7 in June from 49. 4 in May, breaking the boom-or-bust 50 line for the first time. ""The market's upbeat tone was helped by the Chinese government' s announcement that the official PMI figures has rose and the data is a positive sign that the worst is over in the world's second- largest economy,""said Masashi Akutsu, an equity strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.

The incorporation of Chinese elements in the Hollywood blockbuster Transformers: Age of Extinction has backfired as a scenic spot in Chongqing threatened to sue the film's associated producer for failing to show its logo in the film.
Chongqing Wulong Karst Tourism Group, which operates the Wulong Scenic Area, said the film's associated Chinese production company, m1905.com, didn't honor a contract that required the logo of the scenic spot on the big screen as a product placement.
""We are disappointed because we are not even close to our targets of promotions,"" said Li Chu, a marketing manager at the company. Li said the failure to incorporate the scenic area's logo has confused some audiences.
""We did a survey of foreign audiences, which showed that very few of them knew that the film was shot in our scenic area. Some even mistook the scene for Hong Kong,"" he said.
Li said the company is in negotiations with m1905.com and Paramount Pictures to reach a solution. ""If we fail to compromise on a proposal that could remedy our loss, we will resort to legal procedures,"" he said.
This is the second dispute between Chinese commercial partners and Paramount.
Last month, Pangu Estate, the operator of a five-building complex known as Pangu Plaza in Beijing, also threatened to terminate a promotional contract with two commercial partners of Paramount after the film was said to have fallen short of the company's expectations.
The company later reached a compromise with Paramount and its two Chinese partners.
Chen Zhe, a staff member at Paramount's Chinese office, said on Sunday the company would not comment on the issue.
A company executive with m1905.com, who requested anonymity, said Paramount has admitted that failing to show the Wulong logo was a mistake in the film production process.
He said that the tourism company had postponed paying the money for more than five months and this had shortened the production period.
Meanwhile, the fact the production team of the film did not know Chinese has also caused the problem, he said.
""We want to solve the dispute through negotiations,"" he said.
However, Li, the manager of the scenic spot, said the company made the payment as outlined in the contract.
Li said the company closed the Three Natural Bridges for a week in October to shoot the film after a request from the production company. It also paid another 6 million yuan ($967,000) to have its name displayed in the film.
""We just wonder why all the other cities have their names tagged in the film except us,"" he said in response to claims that the production team does not know Chinese.
In the latest meeting between the parties, Paramount has offered to remedy the mistake in all the DVDs that were issued globally, and produce a 30-second promotional video for the scenic area, according to the company executive from m1905.com.

The amazing sum, which is almost equal to its ticket sales in North America, left ""The Breakup Guru,"" a domestic romance also debuted on June 27, far behind.
""Transformers 4,"" has broken several records in China, including the biggest opening of 200 million yuan, compared with the previous 122 million yuan, set by ""The Monkey King.""
According to box office trackers, the autobot protagonists of the movie are poised to dethrone ""Avatar,"" which took in more than 1.3 billion yuan, to become the highest-grossing movie ever shown in Chinese theaters.
The reputation developed by the autobots' previous installments, including ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" which pulled in more than 1 billion yuan in China in 2011, lent an advantage to the latest sequel, according to analysts.
""The Chinese elements in the latest installment also make the film more appealing to the Chinese audience,"" said Rao Shuguang, deputy director of the Beijing-based China Film Art Research Center.
The film stars famed Chinese actress Li Bingbing and contains scenes shots in Chongqing Municipality in southwest China as well as in Hong Kong.
The success of ""Transformers 4"" reflects Hollywood filmmakers' shifting strategy for China, said Rao. ""They are consciously targeting the Chinese market, which is the second largest in the world.""
The screening of ""Transformers 4"" coincides with the summer holiday, when many families go to cinemas for recreation.
Meanwhile, the Chinese film industry is going through a disruptive changing of the guard, with most of the old renowned directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige past their prime and the new generation still fledgling, according to Zhang Yiwu, a professor at Peking University.
The autobots also owe their success to the more than 20,000 movie screens in China. Some 63 percent of them were set aside for ""Transformers 4."" The favorable screening arrangement is a record proportion in the Chinese market.
While many people are worried about the future of domestic productions under the huge success of ""Transformers 4,"" Zhang believes fierce competition from Hollywood could actually help Chinese films to improve.
""Domestic films still lag behind in many ways, including special effects and storytelling, and they can learn more in direct confrontation with the American films,"" the professor said.

The adoption of export-oriented policies aimed at exploiting the abundant labor supply and low wages in emerging markets of the region had spurred rapid economic growth in past decades. This in turn raised significantly per capita income in Asian economies such as Singapore and China's Hong Kong, where their levels are by now comparable with those of mega-cities in advanced countries such as New York, London or Tokyo.
Other Asian economies including South Korea, Malaysia, China and to a smaller extent India and the Philippines have also seen their gaps with the developed economies dramatically narrowing in terms of the average income levels.
While some of the economies such as Japan and South Korea that powered Asia's earlier economic miracles showed relatively low levels of inequality and remain relatively equitable by today, the income distribution picture of most Asian economies was quite a contrary to the earlier conventional view that high inequality is a temporary phase in early economic development which would fade as economies become more industrialized.
China's Hong Kong and Singapore, for instance, have higher net inequality than most developed economies as far as Gini coefficients go. The Gini coefficient ranges from zero to one, with higher values meaning more inequality. With the help of taxes on the riches and conditional cash transfers to lower income groups, some economies in the region managed to curb the rise of income inequality to certain extent.
The Singapore government said the Gini coefficient of the city- state was down from 0.478 in 2012 to 0.463 last year, thanks largely to greater government transfers like good-and-service tax vouchers and the wage credit scheme to subsidize pay rises for workers.
Standard Chartered Global Research said the governments in the region should do more to reduce the income inequality in their economies. It urged many energy-importing economies in Asia like India, Indonesia and Thailand to review their subsidies on fuel, as research found that these subsidies are not effective in reducing inequality and could not help the poor but only increase the burden on government budgets and thus reduce potential spending on infrastructure or poverty-alleviation measures.
According to Standard Chartered, direct cash transfers are often the best way to help the poor. Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, the poor usually know what is best for them and rarely waste cash.

The research house also reminded Asian policy-makers of the urgency to address the effect of changing technology. It said the dangers that new technology could continue to widen pay differentials and reward capital owners are still ongoing.

But the faces that are not there, the workers who were replaced by robotic arms, are at the true core of a trend sweeping China's manufacturing sector.
While normally a labor intensive industry, the solar cell factory, is one of the first in the sector to automate production, leaving dull assembly line tasks to robotic arms.
""The robots can detect positions. Their sensors can match the precision of human eyes,"" said Ren Tianting, chairman of the robot manufacturing company, Confirmware Technology (Hangzhou) Co. Ltd.
""A machine can do the work of 20 workers. Therefore it greatly helps reduce labor costs,"" said Ren. ""Nowadays many young workers are not willing to do factory work as they believe it is dull and unworthy of respect.""
SMART MANUFACTURING
Due to severe labor shortages and ensuing rising labor costs, the labor-intensive solar panel industry has just begun to use robots to replace workers.
Currently, robots have only replaced 20 percent of the total workforce in the industry and therefore there are still three to five golden years for robot sales, Ren said.
""China used to have sufficient labor and there was a small demand for robots,"" said Li Yuewei, marketing director of ADTECH (Shenzhen) Technology Co.. ""The labor shortage in the Pearl River delta, however, is driving robot and other smart equipment makers to see robust industry expansion.""
Rongsheng Group, also in Hangzhou, has made a similar move. Now robots are responsible for 40 percent of their capacity at its textile subsidiary, helping reduce their labor needs by 500 workers.
This is just the start of a new operation model for China's factories, which are embracing smart manufacturing to reduce costs and improve profit margins and competitiveness.
Over the past few years, many Chinese manufacturers have struggled with meager profits due to weak market demand, rising labor costs and low-end products.
To help bolster the competitiveness of the country's manufacturing, which accounts for 20 percent of the world's capacity, the Chinese government released the ""Made in China 2025"" strategy on Tuesday.
The plan, dubbed as China's version of ""Industry 4.0"", is a ten-year guideline to help the country become a manufacturing power in the next decade.
""In the United States, over 70 percent of the innovation originates from the manufacturing sector. It is almost the same in China,"" said Li Beiguang, deputy director of the planning department of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
""With the guideline, we hope it can stimulate innovation to help improve the country's manufacturing competitiveness.""
Wang Jingdong, vice president of home appliance giant Gree, admitted that the biggest challenge to China's manufacturing sector is innovation.
""The industry lags behind in terms of innovation. The government should unveil tough measures to protect innovation and create a fair competitive environment,"" Wang said.
RESHAPING THE INTERNET
The booming internet revolution also presents an opportunity for the manufacturing industry to reshape the value chain.
Miao Wei, Minister of Industry and Information Technology, said China will promote smart manufacturing and also use the internet to reshape the manufacturing sector.
Yin Jing, head of Alibaba's home appliances division, said the big data from e-commerce platforms can help connect manufacturers and their potential customers.
With the data, the manufacturers can easily learn the consumers' likes and churn out more personalized products to cater to different tastes, Yin said, adding the C2B model could help shorten the supply chain management.
In the past, manufacturers did not know exact demands of customers and which would result in oversupply of goods. This is part of the reason Alibaba will soon unveil several tailor-made home appliances, he said.
Lou Jun, vice president of IDG China, said the C2B model is the industrial development trend and it will deeply transform China's manufacturing sector.
Although most consumers have yet to accept the tailor-made services like 3D-printing, the tailor services still have bright market prospects, Lou said.
Gree has made attempts to use the internet to transform its production and after-sale service.
Gree's vice president Wang said data from their central air conditioners could be sent to the company so they could offer energy-saving tips and maintenance plans.
Also with analysis of customer data, the designers can better understand their individualized demands and thus develop products that cater for their needs, Wang said.",'% robot%'

The plan will focus on upgrading the manufacturing sector in order to improve the capacity for innovation ability, integrate informatization, and promote industrialization.
""We generally need about three decades or so to complete the transformation from a manufacturing nation to a manufacturing power"", said Guan Qiao, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. The plan is the program of action for the first decade.
The obvious question during the process is which industries will become the emerging sectors. High-speed or large passenger aircraft? And how will ""made in China"" put aside the image of ""copycatting, cheap, and poor quality""?
""The argument that the competitiveness of ""made-in-China"" products relies only on low cost no longer holds water,"" said Lin Zuoming, President of Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), during the Dialogue program of CCTV on May 3. The ""Made in China 2025"" plan is closely related to the development of Internet technology, he added.
Lin gave an example of labor-cost advantage to explain this. He said that in past, a nine-year compulsory education would provide an adequate qualification for the low to medium industries. But nowadays a worker with an education only up to junior high school is not qualified for work in high-end manufacturing. But on the other hand, once robots replace workers on production lines, the cost will get even lower.
As well as the change in labor cost, with the development of information technology, the production mode in manufacturing companies is changing. Nowadays, the design of all geometric forms can be completed first on the computer, which greatly improves the production efficiency of aircraft.
Lin took the J-10 fighter jet as an example. He said it took twelve years from setting up the project, through research and development, to maiden flight, and another six years to finalize the design. But we spent only a little over five years to finish the process and achieve the first flight of 200-tonne class heavy military airlifter, which is more complicated than the J-10.
Information technology has changed the course of design and manufacture of aircraft, but there is still a gap between China and the most advanced countries, said Zhang Guoxin, vice general manager of AVIC. The design of the Boeing 777 was completed without drawings 10 to 15 years ago.
Furthermore, ""Made in China"" will face new difficulties during the upgrading process. Lin said shortage of funding is the major problem. Data from the early 1950s to the beginning of this century shows that the United States has invested more than 100 billion US dollars in basic research into aircraft engines, while China has invested only 80.6 million US dollars.
In March, 2007, China initiated a project to develop a domestic large passenger aircraft industry. In 2014, docking and fuselage, airfoil and empennage were completed for China's homegrown passenger jet, the C919 - all made in China. But the ""heart"" of the plane, the engine, still needs to be imported.
Lin thinks the development of engines is an experiment-heavy technology and it needs adequate investment to experiment. The more investment you inject, the quicker the technology will mature. And it has a long life cycle, generally 50 years.
According to Lin, the assembly of C919 will be completed this year.

What makes the one-way trip so attractive, with no prospects of a return to Earth? Let's talk about Mars itself.
There is water on Mars. Due to low temperatures, water on Mars is in the form of ice beneath the surface. If the ice were to melt, there is enough water to cover the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 11 meters. Life cannot survive without water, and Mars therefore possesses this basic prerequisite in abundance.
Scientists speculate that billions of years ago, Mars was most probably like Earth, with a very thick atmosphere, water, ocean and even life. However, low gravity resulted in the loss of atmospheric molecules and therefore Mars become cold and dry and then life disappeared or hid underground.
In addition, a small amount of methane in the atmosphere of Mars has been confirmed, but its origin remains a mystery; it may come from a chemical reaction, or from bacteria - and if the latter, it means that life exists on Mars.
Technically, the biggest problem faced by the program is not technical, but the physical and psychological problems. Currently, flying to Mars from Earth takes about eight months. Such a long journey will bring a lot of problems to the migrants, such as muscle atrophy or osteoporosis caused by weight loss. In addition, more cosmic rays radiation may cause cancer, while psychological diseases may result from living in a confined space for a long time.
Furthermore, even if we successfully reach Mars, building a permanent base is also a challenge. Since the number of immigrants will be limited, most of the labor will rely on robots. Besides farming, food and finding water, the most urgent issue is how to produce oxygen.
So, should we migrate to Mars?
Earth's population is growing, and one possible solution is to allow some people to emigrate to other planets. If Earth were to collide with an asteroid, humanity will be destroyed, as happened with the extinction of the dinosaurs 70 million years ago.

An array of mechanical arms and complex machines are poised to replace the human assembly line workers at the Everwin Precision Technology Co., which will become the first factory in Guangdong Province to become fully automated under a new ""replace human workers with robot workers"" policy, China Youth Daily reported.
The automation of the factory, located in Dongguan, represents what may be a significant new trend - the rise of the robot in the Chinese labor force to offset increasing labor costs.
Fully robotic
Everwin Precision Technology Co has purchased 1,000 new robots, joining 100 that were already working on the assembly line.
This will reduce the number of workers the factory needs, protecting it from a labor shortage which many cities in Guangdong are facing.
""A robotic production line does not mean there is no human labor at all, but it will reduce by about 90 percent the number of the workers,"" said Chen Qixing, the chairman of the company.
""After the factory is fully equipped, it still needs about 200 staff to control the network, and serve as management, while in the past, we needed more than 2,000 workers to operate the entire factory,"" he explained.
Ren Xiangsheng, a deputy general manager of the company, told China Youth Daily that replacing human labor with robots will also enhance product safety and quality.
""Dongguan is currently working very hard to promote 'replace human workers with robot workers' and our company is determined to become an intelligent robotic factory, using mechanical arms to replace human labor, and build a highly intelligent control system which is run via a network,"" he said.
""This will greatly improve work efficiency and quality,"" Ren added.
Subsidized scheme
The governments of cities in the Pearl River Delta such as Dongguan and Foshan launched the ""replace human workers with robot workers"" scheme in 2014, after seeing its labor shortages create unrest.
According to China News Service, Guangdong Province suffers a shortfall of nearly 800,000 laborers this year, while Dongguan is lacking 100,000 laborers.
In order to encourage the development of robotic production lines, the cities are handing out between 200 million yuan ($32 million) and 500 million yuan in annual subsidies to robot producers and manufacturers who install robots on assembly lines between 2014 and 2016.
As a result, large numbers of robots have already been installed on production lines throughout the province, Guangdong Deputy Governor Xu Shaohua said.
The Dongguan Economy and Information Bureau said that to date, the city has invested more than 4.2 billion yuan on the robotics scheme.
As the technology for automatic production improves, enterprises in these cities are also becoming more innovative.
Zheng Weiping, an assistant manager of the office of the president of CWB Group, a vehicle electronic company, told people.cn that robots have greatly improved the company's efficiency, because one robot can do the work in a day equivalent to six laborers working continuously for a week.
""Apart from low efficiency, workers were always injured by the machines,"" he said.
Labor shortage solution
The rise of the robots could resolve the labor shortage that is affecting not only Guangdong but also other provinces in the country. Robots give enterprises options to stay competitive other than increasing wages or benefits.
Guangdong authorities plan to invest 943 billion yuan to replace human laborers with robots within three years, according to Xinhua.
Zhai Suoling, the president of the Dongguan Taiwan-funded Enterprises Association, said that automating a factory requires a massive investment upfront, but some enterprises can recover the cost in a few years, askci.com reported.
""Compared to the cost of labor, which is increasing more than 20 percent a year, investment in robots may be more worthwhile,"" he said.
The Dongguan Economic and Information Bureau said the scheme has successfully helped the city reduce its labor shortage by about 30,000 people since 2014.
The rise of the robotic factory, however, has also drawn concern. A Xinhua report published on May 4 said replacing human labor with robots will make it more difficult for job seekers to find work, particularly those who are not well educated, because the minimum standard for laborers will increase.
""Those workers who are knowledgeable and have technical skills will be very welcomed by enterprises because they can do maintenance work for the robots and machines,"" it wrote. ""Enterprises and workers both need to change to survive.""
The momentum toward automated factories is continuing. The city of Guangzhou has set a goal of fostering robotic factories with an output value of more than 100 billion yuan and automating more than 80 percent of the city's manufacturing production by 2020, according to the South China Morning Post. The Guangdong provincial government announced in March that it will spend 943 billion yuan on replacing human labor with robots over the next three years.",'% robot%'

Dongguan-based private company Everwin Precision Technology Ltd is pushing toward putting 1,000 robots in use in its first phase of the zero-labor project, China National Radio reported. It said the company has already put first 100 robots on the assembly line.
""The 'zero-labor factory' does not mean we will not employ any humans, but what it means is that we will scale down the size of workers by up to 90 percent,"" said Chen Qixing, the company's board chairman.
After the work on smart factory started, Chen predicted that instead of 2,000 workers, the current strength of the workforce, the company will require only 200 to operate software system and backstage management.
Under the current pressure of labor shortage, calls to use smart robots in cities around the Pearl River Delta (PRD), including Foshan and Dongguan, are becoming louder.
""It is necessary to replace human workers with robots, given the severe labor shortage and mounting labor costs,"" said Di Suoling, head of Dongguan-based Taiwan Business Association.
Manufacturers in the PRD have been hit by a shortage of an estimated 600,000 to 800,000 workers, according to data released after the Spring Festival in February.
Tens of thousands of migrant workers had earlier gone back home to inlands for a family get-together and some of them decided to settle down in their hometown where the living costs are much less than the coastal cities.
The country also faces the problem of an increasing number of aging migrant workers.
Although the number of migrant workers in China continued to grow in 2014, the rate of increase for the group has fallen consecutively for four years, and their average age is on the rise, according to a report released by the National Bureau of Statistics.
The year-on-year growth rate has been declining since 2010. From 2010 to 2013, the figure stood at 5.4 percent, 4.4 percent, 3.9 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.
Around 43.5 percent of migrants in 2014 were over 40 years old, compared to 34.1 percent in 2010, and 30 percent in 2008, government data show.
""In the future, the percentage of migrant workers under 40 will further decrease, and this is a warning for China's labor-intensive manufacturing industry,"" said Li Zuojun, a senior researcher at the Development Research Center of the State Council, according to Economic Daily.
Faced with the dire situation of a shrinking workforce, economists suggest that China should upgrade its technology and largely use smart robots.
Guangdong authorities said in March that they will invest 943 billion yuan ($152 billion) to replace humans with robots within three years.

Companies in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, began modifying their manufacturing processes late last year as labor supply in one of the world's largest manufacturing country began to shrink.
Rising labor cost resulting from a dwindling labor pool in China have hurt the competitiveness of products made by Chinese manufacturers. Multinational firms such as Nike are transferring their manufacturing base away from China to southeast Asia in search of cheaper labor.
A Standard Chartered survey conducted among nearly 300 manufacturers during the first quarter this year in the Pearl Delta Region in south China, including those in Dongguan, found that employers have expected wages to rise more than 8 percent this year.
Investment into manufacturing upgrades and growing use of automated production system also drove down the average production cost by 12.5 percent last year, the municipal government said.

The two-stage rocket, carrying a communications satellite into orbit for Luxembourg-based satellite operator SES, blasted off at 6:27 p.m. EDT (22:27 GMT) from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
About 10 minutes later, the first stage, or booster, achieved a successful landing on the ""Of Course I Still Love You"" droneship that was stationed in the Atlantic Ocean.
""We just had an incredible day today,"" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said during a live webcast of the launch. ""The first reflight of an orbital class booster did its mission perfectly, dropped off the second stage, came back and landed on the droneship, right in the bullseye.""
Elon said the feat means it can fly and refly an orbital class booster, which is the most expensive part of the rocket.
""This is going to be ultimately a huge revolution in spaceflight,"" Musk continued. ""It's the difference between if you had airplanes where you threw away an airplane after every flight versus you could reuse them multiple times.
Previously, the first stage of the rocket for the SES-10 mission flew in a cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station cargo for the the U.S. space agency NASA in April 2016.
SpaceX achieved a space industry first in December 2015 when its Falcon 9 rocket booster successfully landed upright on solid ground at Cape Canaveral, Florida, after launching 11 small satellites into orbit.
The feat has since been repeated both on land and at sea for multiple times.
SpaceX's rival firm, Blue Origin, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, successfully completed similar rocket recovery tests, but all of its missions were suborbital, not orbital, ones.
All these attempts were aimed at producing a fully and rapidly reusable rocket, which allegedly will dramatically reduce the cost of space transport.
Traditionally, rockets are designed for a single use only, burning up or crashing into the ocean after liftoff.
Falcon 9's second stage, which currently still is expendable or single use, also succeeded in its mission to send the SES-10 satellite to a geostationary transfer orbit.
Once in position, the satellite will provide telecommunications services to Latin America.
SES has been known to be ""a strong supporter"" of SpaceX's approach to reusability over the years. Back in 2013, it was the first company to launch a commercial satellite on a Falcon 9 rocket.
The European satellite operator hailed Thursday's launch as ""one step closer to rapid rocket reusability"" and ""one step closer to faster, easier access to space.""
""Reusable rockets will not only drive down the launch cost,"" it said in a statement. ""They will also allow a higher launch frequency, which will definitely bring a new agility and competitive edge to the satellite industry.""",'% Elon Musk%'

People's Daily Online: How to change people's long-lasting habit of traveling by air or by car to take high-speed rail?
Dan Richard :In the United States, we have many things that are very well developed. We have freight rail system that is probably most efficient in the world. And yet our passenger rail system is very far behind the rest of the world. We admire the incredible achievements in China of building high speed rail network. So part of what we are doing is that we are taking lessons from other parts of world where high speed rail has been built and we are able to show people that in this countries, passengers have gotten out of their cars and have taken trains instead of airplanes. And this has been something that has been going on across the world. So we expect the same experience here.

Dan Richard : We have done many studies on this. And it's important to say that's not just the studies we have done but we have asked other experts to review that work, to give their critics and their understanding of it. And at this point, we feel very confident that the numbers that are estimating for riders are probably conservative and so we believe that our high speed rail line will have very strong ridership across California. And that will meet very important test we have. Under California law, when we build high speed rail, it must be able to operate without government subsidy, which means that it must be able to get enough riders to get enough ticket revenue to cover the cost of operating the system. So we have to be very careful to make sure that the ridership numbers, ridership projections are as accurate and as sound and carefully analyzed as possible.
People's Daily Online: How do you get the number?
Dan Richard : There are many ways to estimate the ridership. For example, we look at the trips between cities right now by air or by car. We can look at the experience from other areas. We go out and we do surveys of people to get a sense of what their demands and interests will be. We also have some existing trains that are not high speed rail that actually have very high levels of ridership. And we know that those people if they are riding a train that is slow would be very likely, as long the prices are reasonable, to shift to the train that is fast. The scientists are able to come up with computer projections of this. And then we test those and we ask other experts to look at those. I think that number of course is very small compared to numbers in China. But for our first line, we believe we will have 29 million passengers per year between Los Angeles and San Francisco. And that is going to be more than enough to cover the cost of the operating the system.
People's Daily Online: What's the ticket price for the trip between San Francisco and Los Angeles?
Dan Richard : We have been thinking of the ticket price. And one of the things we realizes is that we look at the experiences in Europe and in France where they have high speed rail, for a long time, there are battles with the airlines over the ticket pricing. We imagine the ticket price will be 85% of the discount airfare. When we did the study, you can buy a airplane ticket from San Francisco to Los Angeles for about 100 dollars. Since that time, the price for the airport ticket has gotten up very high, it's much more expensive now because of fuel and demand. We thought if we have high speed rail today, our ticket price will be about 85 U.S. dollars. We believe that high speed rail will be very affordable, not just for wealthy people, but for average citizens.
People's Daily Online: People joked it ""turtle speed"" that it takes 35 years to get the project started from 1980s to January 2015. What's your comment on this?
Dan Richard : When countries develop, I know China is going through this process right now with your extraordinary rapid economic development, at first people are very interested in the jobs and what it takes just build this and get the jobs. And then more people get the jobs and more people live a comfortable life. People start to worry about other things. So we have people in this country who wants living in nice communities, they don't want to change. So they raise objections and we tries to listen to them. so what slows this down is that we look at the environmental issues and we look at the communities and all of these things. We very much admire how China has been able to build this system so fast. But I think it is also my understanding that now sometimes as your country is developing so well, once they are receiving these benefits of better life and then they start to think wait a minute, I don't want anything to change. And so they come to resistance. This is just the way is in our country right now. And we have laws that allow people to raise objections and try to slow things down. And sometimes they do. I know when we meet with officials of Chinese government and Chinese business, they look at us and just shake their heads, they don't understand why it takes long. But this is just the process here.
People's Daily Online: The total cost is expected 68 billion U.S. dollars. How can you get that money?
Dan Richard : Sixty eight billion US. dollars includes inflation. If we can build it all in one time, it would be about 54 billion dollars. We are trying to find ways to make it go faster and we will also make it cheaper. Governor Brown said he is not worried about the money. We will have the money. We have some money from federal government. We have some money from our state government in California. And we expect about 1/3 of the project cost will be paid for by the private sector whether its private companies, or whether it's other nation's company. In California, we have a law last year to help deal with the global warming problem. This is a way that we are looking at the global warming problem which is under cap-and-trade. If some business can't reach that level, they can buy credits from another business. The state earns money by selling these credits to the businesses. Since the program just started, we are not completely sure. But we believe that the potential for that is between a half billion U.S. dollars each year. And the program goes on into the future. Ten to fifteen billion U.S. dollars from that is not out of question at all. Maybe 20 billion from private sector, 10-15 from cap-and-trade, we have state bond money that are state voters vote for another 9 billion, we have 3 billion dollars of federal money. Plus, we will have money from advertising. We will have money from development surrounding the stations. We will have money from allowing companies to come in, and lease our right of way. We will collect money from people like that. So there are a lot of other sources in addition to the big pieces that will help put the whole package together.
People's Daily Online: Do you accept international money?
Dan Richard : Certainly. In fact, our organization just met with a group of Chinese governmental officials and companies. Other countries are coming in as well. We are very open. Our governor Brown went to China in 2013 on the trade mission. He signed a number of cooperative agreements with provincial governments. California is very interested in a strong working partnership with China. And we are open to other countries as well. As I said at the beginning, around the world, people have successfully built high speed rail. China has more miles of high speed rail than any other nation on earth. So we are not trying to do something totally new. We are trying to build a system serves our people and working cooperatively with experienced international operators which is very open.
People's Daily Online: Do you have any concerns about accepting international money?
Dan Richard : I don't have concerns about accepting the money. We just have to put business structure together that works for everybody.
People's Daily Online: What's the structure?
Dan Richard : Let me say two things, first of all, we have a structure in mind, but what we have said is that we would entertain any other proposals that people may make, so just because this is what we have in mind does not mean it's the only way that this can be done.
But our thought is that we would be building part of this with our funds, and then we would allow other organizations from other countries or other private companies to come in and to bid, to offer, to operate the system and may to build part of the operating. And then that organization would receive the revenues and they would have a chance to make profit. That is our thinking of the structure. But is somebody has a different structure, a different idea to help us build this faster, we are happy to talk about that.
People's Daily Online: How can Chinese companies get involved?
Dan Richard : I think they have already been involved since we have met with a number of Chinese companies and also with Chinese government officials. We invite people to come and talk with us those business negotiation and business discussion. I think that's the main message that we are very eager to work with people to get our project built. And we are open to many different ideas.
People's Daily Online: What the main risks? What can you do to guarantee the return?
Dan Richard : This is the area that is challenging because our law doesn't allow us to guarantee the return. So they must look at this and decide if they think that the ridership projections we have made are correct and so they would make investment. And of course you know there is profit potential here.
People's Daily Online: What are the criteria for selecting a partner?
Dan Richard : What are important for us would be the experience people have with high speed rail, to build, to operate safely, and it would be creative and would be able to help us to build faster and cheaper. So that experience and how that experience will help us build our project faster and cheaper, I think would be the most important thing for us.
People's Daily Online: What are the advantages of the Chinese companies?
Dan Richard : Two things: one, China has tremendous experience. China has now built many high speed rail lines in many different places. It has the experience with construction. A lot of lines in China have been through difficult areas and through mountains, so for us, you have experience in construction, you have experience with operation. That experience will be a huge advantage. Financing package would be advantage also. I need to say we are open to work with anybody. So clearly, we have interests from many parts of the world. But I also want to make it very clear that we are open. And we are happy to sit down. There is no resistance to ideas of foreign nations, whether it is China or any other nation being our partner of the project.
People's Daily Online: What challenges they may face?
Dan Richard : I think the challenge would be that if it's the Chinese company, that's their first project building in the United States. There are always culture differences and issues people have to work through when they work in another country. So that may be a challenge. But I think those issues can be addressed. I would say that making sure that they have good communication and harmony of ideas about how the project should be built would be important.
People's Daily Online: How do you think Elon Musk's ""Hyperloop""?
Dan Richard : I like technology. When I was a very young man, I worked at NASA space agency. I am a big fun of technology. I think that's an exciting idea but needs to be tested. It's years away from any real application. That's fine. I am happy to see them tested but you know right now, whether China or the United States or Russia or any other countries, people are looking at the high speed rail technology. They continue to make the trains better and signaling better. There are a lot of interesting technology in the high speed rail area right now. Maybe someday there will be different technology. But I think this approach will last for a very long time.
And I guarantee you no other technology will go faster. Believe me because all these ideas start with somebody drawing a line and looks it's so easy and so good. But in fact, when you actually have to build it, you are running into many difficulties and it takes a long time. So no one is going to be able to come in with a different technology and do it faster than we are doing here.",'% Elon Musk%'

Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, said its New Shepard space vehicle flew to space on Monday, reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers), just past the internationally-recognized boundary of space, and then successfully landed back at its launch site in western Texas.
""Rockets have always been expendable. Not anymore,"" Bezos said in a statement. ""Now safely tucked away at our launch site in West Texas is the rarest of beasts, a used rocket.""
Named after the first American in space, Alan Shepard, the New Shepard vehicle is comprised of two elements: a crew capsule in which the astronauts ride and a rocket booster powered by a single American-made BE-3 liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen engine.
The U.S. firm said the space vehicle took off at 12:21 p.m. EST (1721 GMT) on Monday and reached a velocity of 3.72 times the speed of sound on its way up. Then, the crew capsule separated from the booster and coasted into its planned test altitude, before making a successful parachute descent.
Meanwhile, the booster descended under guided flight to the landing pad. Just prior to landing, the booster re-ignited its BE-3 engine which slowed the vehicle to 7.1 kilometers per hour for ""a gentle, controlled"" vertical landing, only 4.5 feet (1.37 meters) from the center of the pad.
""Full reuse is a game changer, and we can't wait to fuel up and fly again,"" Bezos said.
Blue Origin made a similar attempt in April, but the booster crashed back to Earth because of a hydraulic problem.
Another U.S. space company, SpaceX, which was started by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, has been testing vertical rocket landings as well, but so far its attempts have been unsuccessful.
Musk congratulated Blue Origin on its successful rocket landing on Tuesday but noted that suborbital rockets are not flying high or fast enough when compared to his rockets.
""Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO (Blue Origin) team for achieving VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) on their booster,"" Musk tweeted. ""It is, however, important to clear up the difference between 'space' and 'orbit' ... Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO (geostationary transfer orbit) orbit requires ~Mach 30.""",'% Elon Musk%'

After three failed attempts, it marks a breakthrough not only for SpaceX but also for Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX.
(Photo: spacex.com)
In January and April, the company tried twice but all their efforts thwarted for the failed system and engine malfunction. What’s worse, the rocket ended in an explosion during the company’s third attempt.
That’s why when the rocket landed, Elon Musk tweeted that “11 satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!”
Even NASA and Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, sent their congratulations.
Everyone is told that the success signifies an upcoming cheaper era for space travel. Traditionally, rockets are discarded after they detach from the space shuttle. Now, a private company makes them reusable.
And that’s not the first time that a rocket was guided to land safely on the earth. Blue Origin, another private company headed by Jeff Bezos made a safe rocket landing on November 24 this year after it travelled 62 miles above Earth.
These successful experiments, although from different companies, may bring more significant changes than people can ever imagine. And it will definitely encourage other private companies to try more and encourage more companies to join the club to explore the outer space.
Well, the club now has already had some front- runners: Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, who established his own space tourism company —— Virgin Galactic, a spaceline for Earth with the goal of democratizing access to space for the benefit of life on earth; Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, who designed SpaceShipOne, the first experimental air-launched rocket-powered aircraft with suborbital flight capability that uses a hybrid rocket motor; and Google Lunar X Prize incentivizes space entrepreneurs to land a privately funded robot on the moon.
Life is not about ongoing trivial, but about poem and travel. Maybe only when people really care about remote things, could they change where they live.
Elon Musk’s goal is to “colonize” Mars by creating two “suns” over the Mars to warm up the red planet and turn any frozen carbon dioxide into gas. He even mentioned that SpaceX is currently working on plans for their Mars transit vehicle during an interview this year.
Now the Mars is not a totem for those explorers. It could be a new habitat for human beings. Imagine in 20 years, When SpaceX build a home on Mars, are you willing to sell everything and buy a one-way ticket from Elon Musk to be the first habitants there?

The Paypal founder and boss of SpaceX and Tesla Motors, outlined his futuristic idea in 2013 as a way of carrying passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco in under 35 minutes.
He challenged innovators to bring the dream to life and Hyperloop Technologies, one of the startups that picked up the gauntlet, is hosting a 'sneak preview of the future of transportation technology'.
It will be showcased in a two-day event billed as involving a demonstration at a test site outside Las Vegas.
The first demonstration of Elon Musk's Hyperloop technology is to be tested at a site outside of Las Vegas during a two day event by one of two competing LA-based companies attempting to create the 'transport of the future'. A Tesla Motors concept drawing of the Hyperloop is pictured
A series of tweets fired from the Twitter account @HyperloopTech teased 'big announcements you don't want to miss' and included a video snippet of construction in the desert.
A caption in the video clip heralded a 'milestone event' that would be live-tweeted from Las Vegas beginning at Tuesday 5pm PDT (Wednesday 1am BST).
Late last year, Hyperloop chief executive Rob Lloyd said in an online post that the team was working toward a 'Kitty Hawk' moment in 2016.
The post came with word of an agreement to use an industrial park in the city of North Las Vegas to conduct a Propulsion Open Air Test of the blazingly-fast rail system.
Lloyd described it at the time as a very important step on the way to realizing the full potential of Hyperloop Tech.
'Our ""Kitty Hawk"" moment refers to our first full system, full scale, full speed test,' Lloyd said.
'This will be over two miles of tube with a controlled environment and inside that tube we will levitate a pod and accelerate it to over 700 miles (1,125 kilometers) per hour.'
He indicated in the post that a full-scale test might not take place until late this year.
Hyperloop did not reveal what components of the system would be shown in a demonstration slated to take place Wednesday at the test site.
The Hyperloop project went live in 2013 on crowdfunding platform JumpStart Fund, which marries crowdsourcing expertise with crowdfunding.
That year, Musk unveiled a design for a super-fast transport system dubbed 'Hyperloop' that could carry passengers in low-pressure tubes at near-supersonic speeds.
The project could connect Los Angeles and San Francisco in 35 minutes in a low-cost alternative to a high-speed rail network planned for California.",'% Elon Musk%'

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 27 -- U.S. space firm SpaceX will fly two private space travelers on a passenger flight around the moon and back before the end of next year, the company said on Monday.
""Fly me to the moon ... Ok,"" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk posted on Twitter.
Once operational Crew Dragon missions are underway for U.S. space agency NASA, SpaceX will launch the private mission on a journey to circumnavigate the moon and return to Earth, according to a statement from the company.
Lift-off will be from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A near Cape Canaveral in Florida, the same launch pad used by the Apollo program for its lunar missions.
Since the last of NASA's Apollo moon landings in 1972, no astronauts have traveled beyond low-Earth orbit. That means an opportunity for humans to return to deep space for the first time in 45 years.
The two individuals, who have not been named, have already paid a significant deposit to do a moon mission, according to the California-based company.
The company plans to launch its passenger flight in 2018 by using a Dragon 2 spacecraft and the massive new Falcon Heavy rocket.
SpaceX, founded in 2002 by billionaire Musk, has been the face of American commercial space industry. It has been hired by the U.S. space agency NASA to resupply the International Space Station (ISS) using its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon cargo ship.
The company suffered a major setback in September last year, when its Falcon 9 rocket exploded on its launch pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida, dealing a blow to the company's ambitious space exploration project, and even America's commercial space industry.
Also in June 2015, its Falcon 9 rocket exploded midair just minutes after liftoff during its seventh space station resupply mission.
As part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, SpaceX needs to perform an average of four Dragon 2 missions to the ISS per year, three carrying cargo and one carrying crew.",'% Elon Musk%'

The book cover of ""Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow""
What are the major trends of human society in the future? What kind of role will China play in the future world? To seek answers, People’s Daily App has a special interview with Harari.
1. People’s Daily App: In your previous interview, you mentioned that China was taking the lead in international economy and politics. Recently some scholars say that the mankind is about to meet the fourth wave of changes in its history, and this time both China and the US will be the heralds. Do you agree with such statements?
Yuval Noah Harari : Yes, humankind is on the verge of the greatest revolution ever. The combination of machine learning and biotechnology will give humankind the ability to start engineering new life forms such as cyborgs, super-humans and AI. The main products of the future economy will not be food, textiles and vehicles, but rather bodies, brains and minds.
This will be not just the greatest revolution in history, but the greatest revolution in biology since the appearance of life on earth. For four billion years life was governed by the laws of natural selection, and life was confined to the organic realm. During all these eons, whether you were a virus or a dinosaur, you evolved according the principles of natural selection and you were made of organic compounds. In the coming century, however, science is likely to usher the era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design.
The new powers of AI and bioengineering will not be shared equally by all humans. Rather, they will probably be monopolizing by a small number of countries. At present it seems highly likely that the two most important countries that will develop these new powers are the USA and China.
2. People’s Daily App: If you agree with such statements, what kind of irreplaceable role do you think that China plays in heralding the fourth wave? From your long-term observation of human history, what can China contribute?
Yuval Noah Harari : I think China is likely to lead this new revolution because it is extremely aware of the dangers of being left behind. In the nineteenth century China delayed in industrializing, and as a result it was humiliated and exploited for a century by industrial powers such as Britain, Russia and Japan. These bitter memories are still very fresh in the mind of the Chinese, and they are therefore unlikely to repeat the same mistake again. This time they are determined not to be left behind, but rather to lead the new revolution.
Yet I think China is likely to play a key role in the next revolution for another reason. During the Industrial Revolution, new technologies created unprecedented social, economic and political problems on a global scale. Instead of cooperating to face these problems together, different countries entered into fierce competition that resulted in terrible wars and inflicted misery on billions of people. In the twenty-first century, bioengineering and AI will again create unprecedented global problems, and this time if we do not act wisely, the result might be the complete destruction of humankind.
We must find a way to cooperate more effectively, because no nation can deal with the new problems by itself. As long as it acts alone, no nation can regulate bioengineering, or prevent the development of autonomous weapon systems, or stop climate change. Hence in order to survive and flourish in the twenty-first century, humankind needs to build a global community.
China can fulfill a key role in building such a community, not only because it is a leading economic and political power, but especially because China has a much longer experience in uniting diverse people than any other country in the world. Whereas the European Union is barely a few decades old, and the USA is just 250 years old, China has thousands years of history. During that time the Chinese have had a lot of experience in balancing the needs and interests of many groups of people living in different regions and under different conditions. This experience will be vital for the survival and success of humankind in the coming decades.
3. People’s Daily App: In the previous waves of changes in human history, many countries served as heralds, such as China, Britain and the U.S. in the previous scientific revolutions. What are the criteria to be met before we can say one nation is heralding a historical period or a scientific revolution? And what capabilities and conditions are required if countries are to stay on top of the waves of the history?
China used to be the herald of the first wave of changes in human history. What elements and strengths did China acquire to take the lead? If China wants to obtain the leading position once again, what new changes does it need to undertake?
Yuval Noah Harari : The leading role in historical revolutions has shifted between different countries and regions. To take a leading role in historical revolutions, and particularly revolutions in science and technology, you must be open to the world, you must be prepared to change, and above all you must be willing to admit ignorance. Many civilizations stagnated because they became convinced that they know everything, and that nobody else can teach them anything of value.
The great discovery that launched the Scientific Revolution in Europe was the discovery of ignorance. Modern Europeans realized that they are ignorant about many of the most important questions of life, and that the answers are not in the Bible. Nobody knows the answers – we need new observations and new research if we want to get these answers. And for that, we need the freedom to experiment, think and communicate. The willingness to admit ignorance coupled with the freedom to think and communicate turned Europe into the most vibrant and powerful civilization on earth.
I think part of the reason that China is now gaining on Europe the West, is that China is becoming more open while the West – and particular the USA – is becoming too complacent. Many Americans have become convinced that they know everything better than anybody else in the world, so they can tell everybody how to behave, while they themselves don’t need to learn from others. This attitude characterized China in the past – for example in the age of the Qing dynasty. But from what happened in the 19th and 20th centuries China has learned the danger of such arrogance and self-absorption, and it is now very eager to cooperate with foreigners and learn from them.
4. People’s Daily App: In a survey of opinions of international students from 20 different countries in China, they chose China's high speed railway, Alipay, online shopping and bicycle-sharing as China's Four New Great Inventions. A commonality of these innovative technology and products is that it took only a few years, for them to significantly improve the living standards of Chinese people and the neighboring countries' people, from their initial commercial application. Compared to previous inventions such as steam engine, electricity, and computers, the time new inventions took to be adopted by the world has been shortened by decades or even centuries. What’s your opinion about that?
China has taken steps in scientific innovation and technological improvements, especially in recent years. What changes will China’s innovation bring about to the world technology and human history?
Do you think these changes will ultimately lead to a fundamental revolution around the globe, in other words, initiate the fourth wave of changes in human history?
Yuval Noah Harari : The pace of change is certainly speeding up. Not just in China, but all over the world. As I noted in answer to the first question, we are now on the verge of the greatest revolution ever not just in history, but even in biology. The merger of infotech with biotech will make it possible to engineer life itself.
Yet as new technologies give us more and more power, it is crucial to use that power wisely. For that, humankind will need to work together. If China alone makes wise decisions about the new technologies, but the USA and Russia make wrong decisions, the results could be catastrophic. So when we think about the future, we should think in global terms rather than in national terms. There is no national answer to the dangers of global warming, global inequality, nuclear war and technological disruption. There are only global answers.",'% Machine Learning%'

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba surpassed its US counterpart Amazon as the world's biggest e-commerce company on October 11 after the Hangzhou-headquartered company established the DAMO Academy, a new research institute, on the same day.
It is the second time Alibaba has exceeded Amazon in terms of market value. The first time happened three years ago when Alibaba listed.
The internet giant has also pledged to invest more than 100 billion yuan (about $15.1 billion) over the next three years in advanced technology development.
The DAMO Academy is said to have a connection with its founder Jack Ma’s love for kung fu stories. In Chinese novels, the Damo Academy is a top martial arts institution.
“DAMO” has rich connotations in the Chinese language: It’s the Chinese name for Bodhidharma, a Buddhist monk from India, who once meditated and practiced martial arts at Shaolin Temple in Henan Province. Zen, a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang Dynasty as Chan Buddhism, started with Bodhidharma.
According to Alibaba, DAMO stands for ""discovery, adventure, momentum and outlook,"" and the institute will focus on fundamental science and disruptive technological innovation.
With an ambition of serving at least 2 billion users worldwide, Ma expects the academy to outlive Alibaba and be able to solve problems with future-oriented technologies.
The academy will research quantum computing, machine learning, basic algorithms, network security, visual computing, natural language processing, human-machine interaction, chip technology, sensor technology and embedded systems.
The institute has begun to set up cutting-edge research centers and laboratories for different research areas around the globe.
It will recruit 100 researchers from around the world in the preliminary stage. George Church, a leading light of the Human Genome Project, and Michael I. Jordan, a mastermind in artificial intelligence, have joined the team.",'% Machine Learning%'

“In principle, normal business takeovers shall follow business rules and the laws of the market,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang told reporters at a routine press conference. “We believe there should not be undue political dimensions imposed on commercial takeovers, let alone political intervention.”
Lu's remarks came after Reuters reported that the U.S. may increase scrutiny of Chinese investment in cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, which are vital to American national security.
Citing an aide to a member of Congress, Reuters noted that Republican Senator John Cornyn is drafting legislation that would give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) more power to ban Chinese acquisitions of certain technologies. CFIUS is an inter-agency group that is authorized to review foreign transactions in order to protect national security.
“We also hope that the U.S. side can provide a sound environment for Chinese enterprises to invest and start businesses in the U.S.,” Lu added. “Facts have proven that a sound trade and investment relationship between China and the U.S. brings tangible benefits to the two sides.”

Internet powerhouse Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has appointed a seasoned scientist at Amazon.com Inc to spearhead its efforts in artificial intelligence, a move that will propel its so-called ""NASA plan"" to double up on technology research.
Alibaba in March announced a major project at its first technical meeting in Hangzhou, to galvanize the group's technological capabilities, code-named NASA.
Since June, Ren Xiaofeng, former senior principal scientist at Amazon and a Chinese citizen, has taken on the role as chief scientist and deputy dean at Alibaba's Institute of Data Science and Technologies, its global research and development center, the company confirmed on Monday.
Ren is recruiting a world-class computer vision team at a fast-expanding site in Bellevue, in the United States.
That's according to Ren's updated resume on the website of the University of Washington, where he also serves as an affiliate assistant professor of computer science and engineering.
In his four years at Amazon, Ren was the lead scientist at Amazon Go, using computer vision and machine learning, to transform retailing. The research led to the launch of an automatic check-out system that eliminates unnecessary and annoying customer waiting.
Prior to Amazon, Ren also had deep experience in vision-related projects at Intel Lab, working on computer vision and its applications in activity recognition and monitoring, robotics, and human-computer interaction. Ren holds a PhD in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley.
Alibaba said that Ren's coming onboard indicated an accelerated pace to carry out the NASA project, proposed by founder Jack Ma in March, to boost the firm's technological capacity in 20 years.
Ma said at the time that to meet the group's strategic goal of serving 2 billion customers, creating 100 million jobs and enabling 10 million businesses to become profitable, Alibaba should invest in technological infrastructure featuring machine learning, chips, the internet of things and biometric identification, among others.
As a new entrant to the international cloud market, Alibaba is off to a good start, being included for the first time in a Gartner Inc report this month as being ""well-positioned to take on bigger players such as Amazon and Microsoft Corp"".
Since the start of the year China's tech majors have been plowing in billions of dollars into consolidating a technical arsenal and talent pool to outgun their rivals.
Search engine Baidu Inc hired former Microsoft executive Lu Qi as group president and rolled out its Apollo Project to help drive the development of autonomous cars.
Tencent Holdings Ltd is also betting on cloud technologies and AI, doubling its offshore data centers this year and identifying AI as being synonymous with its services.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- With a specialized non-invasive brain cap, millions of people who are paralyzed or have neurodegenerative diseases may have a chance to control a robotic arm with their minds, according to a study released Wednesday.
Researchers at the University of Minnesota, including three Chinese scientists, have made a breakthrough recently: When research subjects put on a specialized non-invasive brain cap, they were able to move a robotic arm by simply imagining moving their own arms.
""This is the first time in the world that people can operate a robotic arm to reach and grasp objects in a complex 3D environment using only their thoughts without a brain implant,"" said one of the Chinese researchers Bin He, director of Institute for Engineering in Medicine at the University of Minnesota.
""Just by imagining moving their arms, they were able to move the robotic arm,"" He said Wednesday in a news release.
The non-invasive technique, named electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface, records tiny electrical activities produced by neurons in the subjects' brain through a specialized, high-tech EEG cap fitted with 64 electrodes and converts the ""thoughts"" into action by advanced signal processing and machine learning.
Eight out of 13 healthy human subjects completed all the 15 experimental sessions of the study wearing the cap. Subjects gradually learned to imagine moving their own arms without actually moving them, to control a robotic arm to complete reach and automatic grasp tasks in three dimensions.
""Each subject began with virtual cursor control and progressed to robotic arm control with increasing complexity and dimensionality over time,"" said the study published in a Nature research journal named Scientific Reports.
Starting from reaching and grasping objects in fixed locations on a table, the subjects were then able to move the robotic arm to reach and grasp objects in random locations on a table, and finally to move objects from the table to a three-layer shelf by only thinking about these movements.@ ""Most subjects exhibited improved performance over time in controlling both the virtual cursor and the robotic arm,"" the study said. All eight subjects could move a robotic arm to pick up objects in fixed locations with an average success rate above 80 percent and move objects from the table onto the shelf with an average success rate above 70 percent.
""This is exciting as all subjects accomplished the tasks using a completely non-invasive technique. We see a big potential for this research to help people who are paralyzed or have neurodegenerative diseases to become more independent without a need for surgical implants,"" He said.
The next step would be a further development of this technology to realize a brain-controlled robotic prosthetic limb attached to one's body or examine how this technology could work with someone who has had a stroke or is paralyzed, He said.",'% Machine Learning%'

Researchers at Stanford University have created an artificially intelligent (AI) diagnosis algorithm for skin cancer that matched the performance of certified dermatologists.
By making a database of nearly 130,000 skin disease images and training their algorithm to visually diagnose potential cancer, the researchers tested the final product against 21 certified dermatologists. In its diagnoses of skin lesions, which represented the most common and deadliest skin cancers, the algorithm matched the performance of dermatologists.
There are about 5.4 million new cases of skin cancer in the United States every year, and while the five-year survival rate for melanoma detected in its earliest states is around 97 percent, that drops to about 14 percent if it's detected in its latest stages.
Diagnosing skin cancer begins with a visual examination. A dermatologist usually looks at the suspicious lesion with the naked eye and with the aid of a dermatoscope, which is a handheld microscope that provides low-level magnification of the skin. If these methods are inconclusive or lead the dermatologist to believe the lesion is cancerous, a biopsy is the next step.
In hopes of creating better access to medical care, the researchers set out to create an algorithm for skin cancer and reported their findings in this week's issues of Nature.
""We realized it was feasible, not just to do something well, but as well as a human dermatologist,"" said Sebastian Thrun, an adjunct professor in the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. ""That's when our thinking changed. That's when we said, 'Look, this is not just a class project for students, this is an opportunity to do something great for humanity.'""
Bringing the algorithm into the examination process follows a trend in computing that combines visual processing with deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence modeled after neural networks in the brain. ""We made a very powerful machine learning algorithm that learns from data,"" said Andre Esteva, co-lead author of the paper and a graduate student in the Thrun lab. ""Instead of writing into computer code exactly what to look for, you let the algorithm figure it out.""
""There's no huge dataset of skin cancer that we can just train our algorithms on, so we had to make our own,"" Brett Kuprel, co-lead author of the paper and a graduate student in the Thrun lab, was quoted as saying in a news release from Stanford University in Northern California on the U.S. west coast.
""We gathered images from the internet and worked with the medical school to create a nice taxonomy out of data that was very messy - the labels alone were in several languages, including German, Arabic and Latin,"" Kuprel said.
After going through the necessary translations, the researchers collaborated with dermatologists at Stanford Medicine, as well as Helen M. Blau, professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford and co-author of the paper. Together, the interdisciplinary team worked to classify the hodgepodge of internet images. Many of these, unlike those taken by medical professionals, were varied in terms of angle, zoom and lighting.
In the end, they amassed about 130,000 images of skin lesions representing over 2,000 different diseases.
During testing, the researchers used only high-quality, biopsy-confirmed images provided by the University of Edinburgh and the International Skin Imaging Collaboration Project that represented the most common and deadliest skin cancers - malignant carcinomas and malignant melanomas. The 21 dermatologists were asked whether, based on each image, they would proceed with biopsy or treatment, or reassure the patient.
The researchers evaluated success by how well the dermatologists were able to correctly diagnose both cancerous and non-cancerous lesions in over 370 images.
The algorithm's performance was measured through the creation of a sensitivity-specificity curve, where sensitivity represented its ability to correctly identify malignant lesions and specificity represented its ability to correctly identify benign lesions. It was assessed through three key diagnostic tasks: keratinocyte carcinoma classification, melanoma classification, and melanoma classification when viewed using dermoscopy.
In all three tasks, the algorithm matched the performance of the dermatologists with the area under the sensitivity-specificity curve amounting to at least 91 percent of the total area of the graph.
Although the algorithm currently exists on a computer, the researchers believe it will be relatively easy to transition the algorithm to mobile devices.",'% Machine Learning%'

Artificially intelligent (AI) algorithms can learn to identify amazingly subtle information, enabling them to distinguish between people in photos or to screen medical images as well as a doctor. However, such feats relies on training that involves thousands to trillions of data points in most cases and AI doesn't work all that well in situations where there is very little data, such as drug development.
Vijay Pande, professor of chemistry at Stanford University, and his students thought that a fairly new kind of deep learning, called one-shot learning, that requires only a small number of data points might be a solution. ""We're trying to use machine learning, especially deep learning, for the early stage of drug design,"" said Pande. ""The issue is, once you have thousands of examples in drug design, you probably already have a successful drug.""
By applying one-shot learning to drug design problems, as the data was likely too limited, their findings published Monday in ACS Central Science show that the methods have potential as a helpful tool for drug development and other areas of chemistry research.
To make molecular information more digestible, the researchers first represented each molecule in terms of the connections between atoms. This step highlighted intrinsic properties of the chemical in a form that an algorithm could process.
With these graphical representations, the group trained an algorithm on two different datasets -- one with information about the toxicity of different chemicals and another that detailed side effects of approved medicines.
From the first dataset, they trained the algorithm on six chemicals and had it make predictions about the toxicity of the other three. Using the second dataset, they trained it to associate drugs with side effects in 21 tasks, testing it on six more.
In both cases, the algorithm was better able to predict toxicity or side effects than would have been possible by chance. ""We worked on some prototype algorithms and found that, given a few data points, they were able to make predictions that were pretty accurate,"" Bharath Ramsundar, who is a graduate student in the Pande lab and co-lead author of the study, was quoted as saying in a news release from Stanford, a private school in Northern California on the U.S. West Coast.
However, Ramsundar cautioned that this isn't a ""magical"" technique. It was built off of several recent advances in a particular style of one-shot learning and it works by relying on the closeness of different molecules, as indirectly indicated by their formula. For example, when the researchers trained their algorithm on the toxicity data and tested it on the side effect data, the algorithm completely collapsed.
The researchers envision this as groundwork for a potential tool for chemists who are early in their research and trying to choose which molecule to pursue from a set of promising candidates. ""Right now, people make this kind of choice by hunch,"" Ramsundar said. ""This might be a nice compliment to that: an experimentalist's helper.""
Beyond giving insight into drug design, this tool would be broadly applicable to molecular chemistry. Already, the Pande lab is testing these methods on different chemical compositions for solar cells. They have also made all of the code they used for the experiment open source, available as part of the DeepChem library.
""This paper is the first time that one-shot has been applied to this space and it's exciting to see the field of machine learning move so quickly,"" he said.",'% Machine Learning%'

Lee and AlphaGo started the second of the five-game match at about 1 p.m. local time (0400GMT) at Four Seasons hotel in Seoul. The landmark fight between a human and artificial intelligence (AI) will run until next Tuesday.
AlphaGo started off with anomalies. Playing Black, the computer program put its starter at the upper-right flower spot. In turn, Lee also placed his first white stone at a flower.
About one and half minutes later, AlphaGo put the third marker at a position right beside the flower spot, an unconventional move different from the previous day's strategy. AlphaGo placed its first two pieces on the flower spots on Wednesday.
Exchanging conventional moves with each other, AlphaGo put its 13th marker at an anomalous position in the middle of the upper board, which a commentator said was a move he had never seen in the human world of the game.
Another commentator said it may take more than the previous day for the second game to close to an end as the two players are playing in a relative conventional manner.
AlphaGo beat the human Go champion, who has topped the world ranking for most of the past 10 years, during the first face-off of the historic match, which is seen as a representative battle between humans and artificial intelligence.
Lee's loss was seen as a shock as it proves that AI may have surpassed humans in Go, which had been viewed as the last game humans can dominate over machine due to its complex, creative and intuitive nature.
AlphaGo is a computer program developed by Google's London-based AI subsidiary DeepMind. It took the world by surprise after beating European Go champion Fan Hui by 5-0 in October last year.
The AI boasts of a deep learning capability that enables the computer program to discover new strategies by playing games against itself and adjusting neural networks based on a trial-and-error process known as reinforcement learning.
Lee, 33, is seen as one of the greatest Go players in the world as he won 18 world championships for 21 years of his professional career. He recorded a winning rate of about 70 percent with 47 victories in professional matches, while AlphaGo posted a 99.8 percent rate with 504 victories and only one defeat.

1,peopleschina,2016-03-09 00:00:00.000000,2016,http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0309/c202936-9027751.html,"SEOUL, March 9 -- Artificial intelligence (AI) unexpectedly defeated the world human champion of the ancient Chinese board game Go in the first of their five-game match held in Seoul on Wednesday, drawing worldwide attention on the human versus machine showdown.
South Korean Lee Sedol, one of the greatest Go players who has topped the world ranking for most of the past decade, was shockingly beaten by AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google's London-based AI subsidiary DeepMind.
AlphaGo took the world by surprise after beating European Go champion Fan Hui by 5-0 in October last year and even defeated the world champion though four games are left, a result out of widespread expectations among Go experts.
Go enthusiasts had hoped it would take years, or perhaps decades, for AI to triumph over the best human players, but it's now evident that AI technology is much more advanced than many have expected.
The ""match of the century"" drew great attention from across the world, with hundreds of local and foreign journalists from China, South Korea and Japan as well as the United States and European countries gathering at the Four Seasons hotel in central Seoul.
During a press conference in Seoul a day before the opening match, Lee lowered confidence in his victory as AlphaGo seemed to have improved its intuitive power. Go had been viewed as the last game humans can dominate over AI due to its intuitive nature and complexity.
Demis Hassabis, CEO of the DeepMind, told the press conference on Tuesday that AlphaGo has made many upgrades since the game with Fan Hui in October 2015, based on which many experts predicted Lee's sweep victory.
AlphaGo won the opening match, taking a 1-0 lead in the five-game match that will run through next Tuesday. The next game will be held at the same hotel in Seoul from 1 p.m. (0400 GMT).
Lee and AlphaGo played a tight game by the middle of the match, but the 33-year-old resigned when it became clear that the computer program had taken an unassailable lead.
Playing black, Lee put his first position in the right flower spot, and about one and a half minutes later, AlphaGo placed its first marker in the left flower. One of DeepMind developers put AlphaGo's markers on the board, shown through Internet broadcasting, on behalf of the computer program.
From the very beginning, Lee played anomalously by placing his fourth marker at an irregular position, which a commentator said it was the first anomaly he has ever seen from the South Korean Go professional.
AlphaGo responded ""calmly"" to the anomaly, playing aggressively to Lee who in turn took counterattacks against the algorithm, the commentator said.
Lee's slight domination by the middle of the match was reversed as AlphaGo infiltrated into the right areas of black put by the human champion. He tried to change the situations in his favor, but he finally admitted his defeat after his 186th placing.
As Lee got the black which allows his faster starter than AlphaGo, Lee had to win 7.5 areas more than AlphaGo as a handicap for victory, according to Chinese Go rules adopted in the match.
Go originated from China more than 2,500 years ago. It involves two players who take turns putting markers on a grid -shaped board to gain more areas on it. One can occupy the markers of the opponent by surrounding the pieces of the other.
To cover the human versus AI fight, hundreds of journalists gathered at the venue from around the world. The match was broadcast live through TVs in South Korea, China and Japan, with Google's YouTube showing it through an Internet live-stream.
Kim Hyun-jin, wife of Lee Sedol, and their daughter Lee Hye-lim who came to the venue to watch Lee's match, were surrounded by lots of local and foreign journalists at the corner of the hotel for interviews while the match was going on.
At the VIP room, South Korean politicians and senior government officials watched the landmark game, including floor leader of ruling Saenuri Party, head of the main opposition Minju Party, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon and other government officials.
After the announcement of Lee's defeat, people watching the match in and around the venue voiced a sigh over the unexpected loss of the human champion.
Lee has won world Go champions 18 times in the past 11 years, recording a winning rate of about 70 percent with 47 victories in professional matches. AlphaGo has recorded a 99.8 percent winning rate with 504 victories and only one defeat.
With the victory, Google is expected to enjoy great promotional effects from the match of the century, which is also forecast to help Go, known as Weiqi in China and Baduk in South Korea, gain popularity in Western countries as well as in Asia.
The promotion effect is estimated to reach at least 100 million U.S. dollars in consideration of worldwide attention and news media reports from Western countries as well as Asian nations. Google allegedly has invested about 2 million dollars, including 1 million dollars in prize, for the landmark event.
The match drew great attention from news organizations, Go fans and even the general public around the world. With the victory, AlphaGo developer DeepMind could gain reputation as one of the world's leading AI companies.
AlphaGo boasts of its deep learning, a capability of learning to discover new strategies for itself by playing thousands of games between its neural networks and adjusting connections by use of a trial-and-error process known as reinforcement learning.
The world AI market is forecast to grow to nearly 2 trillion dollars by 2025, expanding its application to various fields such as healthcare, disease analysis and even legal advices.
The match between Lee and AlphaGo is also projected to help the Chinese board game gain popularity in Western countries as well as in Asia.

Chen reveals that this invention will be put into production some time this year. As a result, new technologies like anti-fraud face-scanning software and picture search will likely be more reliable and easier to use in the near future.
“Deep learning refers to the method of training multi-layer artificial neural networks. Generally speaking, it is the way a computer imitates the human brain to learn, judge and make decisions using deep neural networks. This will remain as a hot research topic in the field of artificial intelligence,” said researcher Yi Jianqiang of CAS.
In 2010, Google used 16,000 processors running for seven days to train a cat in face recognition. More recently, the computer program AlphaGo beat the human Go champion, which required even more processors.
The deep learning processor that CAS has developed is roughly twice as powerful as the processor that AlphaGo used, which means that it can push artificial intelligence even further.
Though it has been 60 years since the development of artificial intelligence began, most experts believe the field is still in its early stages of development. There is a long way to go. Nevertheless, China’s deep learning smart chip has without doubt made a great contribution.",'% Deep Learning%'

And so a group of 42 African, South Asian and Southeast Asian journalists recently visited DiDi Chuxing, a firm that runs a shared transport platform in the Chinese capital, Beijing, to find out how it helps in facilitating mass transit across the country.
Taking the journalists around, Aaron Liu, one of DiDi’s Public Relations Managers, said the platform was set up in 2012 because the transport situation in major cities was getting worse as demand outstripped supply. The shared public transport platform began with taxis before expanding to other modes of transport.
400 Chinese cities covered
The application enables subscribers to use cost-effective means of transport in 400 Chinese cities, with 450 million registered passengers and 19 million drivers, Sun Liang, DiDi Senior Communications Director explained. On average, 25 million rides are made each day as customers’ requests are responded to with the closest possible services. There are pickup points for passengers.
DiDi's services can be summarised by the belief that there is always a better journey. Photo by Kimeng Hilton
The output of drivers is tracked through Global Positioning Systems (GPS) installed in subscribers’ phones; and also feedback from passengers, explained Sun Liang. This way, hard working and well behaved drivers are rewarded with better pay, Sun Liang told the visiting journalists. According to her, DiDi’s services can be summarized in the catch phrase, “There is always a better journey.”
17.50 million jobs created
As many as 17.50 million job opportunities have been created in 400 cities across China since DiDi came into existence five years ago. The platform helps in transporting more than 440 million passengers. The platform employs 7,000 workers, 50 per cent being engineers and data scientists and half of them being female. Because of the pressure of work, engineers are obliged to exercise at work for 10 to 15 minutes on Wednesdays.
DiDi’s goal is to become a global leader in smart transportation and automotive technology, the world’s largest operator of vehicle networks and a global leader in smart transportation systems by 2020. “We are committed to work with communities and partners to solve the world’s transportation, environmental and employment challenges by using big data-driven deep learning algorithms that optimize resource allocation,” explained Sun Liang.

“By continuously improving users’ experiences and creating social value, we strive to build an open, efficient, collaborative, and sustainable transportation ecosystem,” Sun Liang underscored. After six months of operations, DiDi had only 1,000 rides a day at the end of 2012. Today, it boasts 25 million daily rides. The company’s partners have a fleet of 250,000 electric vehicles.
Foreign outreach
DiDi began extending its activities abroad in 2015. Management believes that there are prospects in the developing world where car ownership is still low. DiDi merged with Uber China in 2015, Kuaidi in 2014 and has partnerships with Ola in India, Taxify in South Africa, Careem in the Middle East and North America, 99 in Brazil, Lyft in the US and Grab in Southeast Asia. DiDi now has 9 different businesses. Meanwhile, Careem is currently testing the shared transport application in Egypt and South Africa.

DiDi Chuxing offers a diverse range of transportation services through one mobile application. It uses an intelligent ride-matching system that ensures multi-person car-pooling within and across cities, real-time traffic mapping and route optimization. Cities are supported by DiDi to efficiently and sustainably plan transportation using big data-based transportation capacity.
Security safeguards
DiDi Express is the most cost effective service costing at least 13 RMB a ride. Normal taxis in Beijing charge from 15 RMB per ride. The security measures taken by DiDi include verifying that drivers are actually who they claim to be, checks are carried out on drivers’ backgrounds and their papers are thoroughly scrutinized in conjunction with law enforcement and local transport authorities, officials stressed. Subscribers’ and drivers’ phone numbers are concealed in order to protect them.
""There is an emergency button on the application installed in subscribers’ phones. There is also round-the-clock service throughout the week,"" Sun Liang assured, adding that the application is able to track down the location of drivers and passengers at any time. Moreover, a comprehensive insurance package is offered to drivers and passengers in the event of accident.

April Fools' Day is not all about pranks. China's Internet giant Baidu is dead serious about its plan? to be launched on April 1?to include science fiction writers in its research on artificial intelligence.
The Baidu Verne Plan involves setting up a consulting team to bring the world's best science fiction writers together with leading scientists in a quest to turn imagination into reality.
The project, named after French novelist Jules Verne, has already invited six people to be the first group of advisers in the team, according to Beijing-based Baidu.
The company said that some of Verne's imagination seen in his books in the 19th century, such as helicopters, had been realized in the 20th century.
Apart from Andrew Ng, Baidu's chief scientist, the other five advisers are science fiction writers. They include Liu Cixin, who last year became the first Asian author to win the Hugo Award for Best Novel for his book The Three-Body Problem, and David Brin, an award-winning author from the United States.
Baidu said in a statement that the advisers will receive updated information on how the company is developing certain technologies.
They will also be able to communicate with Baidu's research and development team to turn some of the ideas into products through brainstorming.
Liu Cixin told The Paper in an interview: ""This is an innovative organization. Many ideas, along with innovative work, will be born here. The project will focus on artificial intelligence, and there will be an opportunity for us to work with scientists once the project is officially launched.""
Baidu said the project is highly exclusive, open only by invitation.
It is in line with the company's ambitions, as its President Zhang Yaqin has said artificial intelligence is the foundation to empower traditional industries and make them smart. He told China Daily, ""Baidu has made some world-class achievements in the key subfields of artificial intelligence, such as image recognition, voice recognition, machine translation and self-driving cars.""

AlphaGo, the AI player of the Go board game, hit the headlines again recently by achieving 60 straight online victories over more than 5o of Asia's top Go players.
AlphaGo, under the username ""Master,"" has defeated 59 world-class Go players on online Go platforms since December 29, 2016, including players from China, Japan and South Korea, such as Ke Jie, Yuta Iyama and Park Jeong-hwan. ""Master"" revealed that it is an AI on January 4, before a match with world-class Chinese player Gu Li in which it easily achieved its 60th victory.
""Thanks for the shock AlphaGo brought to the game of Go ... though I knew the identity of Master from the beginning, I still strongly wished that a human could win when watching the games,"" Ke Jie wrote on his Sina Weibo account on January 4.
Man behind the machine
Aja Huang, senior research scientist at Google DeepMind and the lead programmer of AlphaGo, was the one who moved the game pieces for AlphaGo during the matches.
His computer science and information engineering master's tutor at National Taiwan Normal University, Lin Shun-Shii, told the Global Times about Huang and AlphaGo on Thursday.
Huang started to learn Go when he was a child and continued playing into adulthood, which helped him develop AlphaGo, said Lin.
In around 2004, Huang began to develop a Go AI named after his wife Erica. Huang observed other similar programs and often discussed how to improve the Erica AI with Lin.
At the beginning, at competitions which pit Go programs against each other, Erica was an average player, but after gradual improvements, Erica became one of the best programs at the time and won Huang a gold medal at a Japanese competition.
Today, AlphaGo is still using some of the technologies pioneered in Erica.
Lin told the Global Times that AlphaGo was upgraded after playing historic matches against some top Go players in March 2016, when it was ""not so good sometimes.""
However, the AI won all 60 matches this time, which ""never happened in history.""
""No other program but AlphaGo could win 60 matches, so DeepMind, the developer, admitted that 'Master' was AlphaGo,"" Lin noted.
""Now that our unofficial testing is complete, we're looking forward to playing some official, full-length games later this year in collaboration with Go organizations and experts, to explore the profound mysteries of the game further in this spirit of mutual enlightenment,"" DeepMind announced on January 4.
Humans besting humans
Nowadays, with the rapid development of AI, people have mixed feelings about the technology - both hopes and fears.
Lin believed that ""it is an inevitable trend that humans cannot beat computers anymore.""
Our computer systems have become smarter and more powerful, and if the computers are better than you at the most advanced decisions, just let them do it, Lin said. ""You cannot help it.""
""This is a victory for human beings, not for machines,"" said Yu Kai, founder of the Institute of Deep Learning at Baidu Inc and CEO of Horizon Robotics, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
Yu also argues that as the algorithms controlling machines are created by humans, so if their orders are changed, the machines cannot win.
Yu believed that AI could become partners to humans and be used for production, education, medicine and transportation. The development of AI technology does not aim to replace mankind's with machines, but to extend human's abilities, he says. ""Technologies could help humans in the areas that we are not good at.""
When an AI surpasses humans in some areas, it is actually human beings surpassing themselves, said Wang Yuefei, chief of the Beijing-based State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, according to Xinhua.
""How could we benefit more people with these advances is the question that we should consider the most,"" Wang noted.

Researchers at Stanford University have created an artificially intelligent (AI) diagnosis algorithm for skin cancer that matched the performance of certified dermatologists.
By making a database of nearly 130,000 skin disease images and training their algorithm to visually diagnose potential cancer, the researchers tested the final product against 21 certified dermatologists. In its diagnoses of skin lesions, which represented the most common and deadliest skin cancers, the algorithm matched the performance of dermatologists.
There are about 5.4 million new cases of skin cancer in the United States every year, and while the five-year survival rate for melanoma detected in its earliest states is around 97 percent, that drops to about 14 percent if it's detected in its latest stages.
Diagnosing skin cancer begins with a visual examination. A dermatologist usually looks at the suspicious lesion with the naked eye and with the aid of a dermatoscope, which is a handheld microscope that provides low-level magnification of the skin. If these methods are inconclusive or lead the dermatologist to believe the lesion is cancerous, a biopsy is the next step.
In hopes of creating better access to medical care, the researchers set out to create an algorithm for skin cancer and reported their findings in this week's issues of Nature.
""We realized it was feasible, not just to do something well, but as well as a human dermatologist,"" said Sebastian Thrun, an adjunct professor in the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. ""That's when our thinking changed. That's when we said, 'Look, this is not just a class project for students, this is an opportunity to do something great for humanity.'""
Bringing the algorithm into the examination process follows a trend in computing that combines visual processing with deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence modeled after neural networks in the brain. ""We made a very powerful machine learning algorithm that learns from data,"" said Andre Esteva, co-lead author of the paper and a graduate student in the Thrun lab. ""Instead of writing into computer code exactly what to look for, you let the algorithm figure it out.""
""There's no huge dataset of skin cancer that we can just train our algorithms on, so we had to make our own,"" Brett Kuprel, co-lead author of the paper and a graduate student in the Thrun lab, was quoted as saying in a news release from Stanford University in Northern California on the U.S. west coast.
""We gathered images from the internet and worked with the medical school to create a nice taxonomy out of data that was very messy - the labels alone were in several languages, including German, Arabic and Latin,"" Kuprel said.
After going through the necessary translations, the researchers collaborated with dermatologists at Stanford Medicine, as well as Helen M. Blau, professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford and co-author of the paper. Together, the interdisciplinary team worked to classify the hodgepodge of internet images. Many of these, unlike those taken by medical professionals, were varied in terms of angle, zoom and lighting.
In the end, they amassed about 130,000 images of skin lesions representing over 2,000 different diseases.
During testing, the researchers used only high-quality, biopsy-confirmed images provided by the University of Edinburgh and the International Skin Imaging Collaboration Project that represented the most common and deadliest skin cancers - malignant carcinomas and malignant melanomas. The 21 dermatologists were asked whether, based on each image, they would proceed with biopsy or treatment, or reassure the patient.
The researchers evaluated success by how well the dermatologists were able to correctly diagnose both cancerous and non-cancerous lesions in over 370 images.
The algorithm's performance was measured through the creation of a sensitivity-specificity curve, where sensitivity represented its ability to correctly identify malignant lesions and specificity represented its ability to correctly identify benign lesions. It was assessed through three key diagnostic tasks: keratinocyte carcinoma classification, melanoma classification, and melanoma classification when viewed using dermoscopy.
In all three tasks, the algorithm matched the performance of the dermatologists with the area under the sensitivity-specificity curve amounting to at least 91 percent of the total area of the graph.
Although the algorithm currently exists on a computer, the researchers believe it will be relatively easy to transition the algorithm to mobile devices.",'% Deep Learning%'

Before iPhoneX’s Animoji feature went viral with its cute and vivid expressions, a less entertaining but more practical facial recognition had been widely used in China.
China has been reportedly one of the world’s most popular destinations for investment in facial recognition, and the record-breaking amount of $460 million total investment in AI technology also fell on Chinese company Megvii, which claimed the world title in the computer vision competition in October.
Human faces, both unique and irreplaceable, are turning into keys at an increasing number of public facilities. In Shenzhen, facial recognition is used at a 24/7 unmanned store to unlock doors for items after identity is confirmed and payment is made via We Chat, while in Guangzhou, a high school library allows students to borrow books using facial recognition technology.
As an early and high-profile case, Alipay, one of China’s biggest online payment platforms, began to promote its facial recognition technology in 2015. Two years later, a KFC restaurant in Hangzhou started using Alipay’s facial recognition technology to allow people to pay for their food.
But the high-tech “trick” goes beyond recreation to serve on a wider basis.
Blessed with advanced facial recognition technology, China is also estimated to have the largest video surveillance market in the world. The market value reportedly topped $6.4 billion in 2016 in China, where some 176 million surveillance cameras have been installed, according to the latest report from IHS Markit. The market is expected to continue to grow at an annual growth rate of 12.4 percent through 2021.
In comparison, the same market in the US was valued at $2.9 billion in 2016 and the estimated annual growth rate is a mere 0.7 percent.
Earlier in 2017, a video that showed surveillance video footage detecting faces on an unidentified street with detailed descriptive information of each person stunned many netizens around the world and even in China. Many marveled at how human beings can now be immediately digitalized into strings of data.
The days of surveillance cameras as mere data collectors are over. Today, security systems are responsible for real-time data collection, analysis, and application, according to Wang Jianfeng, a product engineer with Hangzhou-based Dahua Technology, one of China’s leading video surveillance companies.
While some feel threatened by a technology that puts almost everyone under the spotlight, many more feel safer when such technology is in good hands.
“Facial recognition plays a crucial role in this process, as it saves time and manpower for public security authorities to more precisely identify suspects via a real-time data pool. The technology is not for commercial use or simple head counting. It will play a more active role in proactive security defense in the future,” Wang told People’s Daily Online.
Dahua’s facial recognition system is now widely used in public security in China, including a warning system in Beijing that can detect major suspects and a monitoring system to monitor pedestrians at traffic lights in Fuzhou, Fujian province. The company’s product is also used in East and Southeast Asia, including Japan and Thailand, for facial recognition and warning from customs inspection to park surveillance, according to Wang.
Hikvision, another leader in video surveillance technology in China, reportedly helped capture five criminal suspects with a database of 973,661 facial images created during the 2017 South-Southeast Asia Commodity Expo and Investment Fair held in Kunming, capital of Southwest China's Yunnan Province in June.
“Currently, facial recognition algorithms are mainly based on deep learning, which uses big data to train the system. China has a huge database of facial data, which is a natural advantage in training over Western countries,” Wang explained.
However, Wang admitted that some commercial facial recognition systems may be relatively weaker in recognizing non-Asian faces.
“In the future, different recognition technologies will be integrated to identify a person and not just his or her face. Every biometric technology has its own limits. We need to combine them together to pinpoint each individual,” Wang said.",'% Deep Learning%'

The essay, published on Medium.com on May 6, describes the research by Wu Xiaolin and Zhang Xi as “deeply problematic, both ethically and scientifically.” Wu and Zhang, from Shanghai Jiaotong University, authored a paper titled “Automated Inference on Criminality using Face Image.”
The essay read: “This is especially unfortunate given that the correlation they measure — assuming that it remains significant under more rigorous treatment — may actually be an important addition to the already significant body of research revealing pervasive bias in criminal judgment. Deep learning based on superficial features is decidedly not a tool that should be deployed to ‘accelerate’ criminal justice.”
The essay was jointly written by Google scientists Blaise Aguera y Arcas and Margaret Mitchell, together with Alexander Todorov from the Social Perception Lab at Princeton University.
This is only the latest criticism of the controversial research. Previously, the paper by Wu and Zhang has been attacked both at home and by international scholars. In their paper, the two researchers detailed the results of computer tests that used 1,856 images of real people, which they claimed produced evidence for ""the validity of automated face-induced inference on criminality, despite the historical controversy surrounding the topic.”
In response to the latest round of criticism, Wu said that the team has no interest and lacks the social science academic background to offer an explanation of their results or discuss how they were formed. “Nor have we ever implied that we would put [the results] into law enforcement or the judiciary. They were forcing those intentions on us,” Wu told Thepaper.cn.
Wu also pointed out that the writers ignored their original introduction, which stated unambiguously that the intent of their research was not to discuss or debate societal stereotypes. “Rather we want to satisfy our curiosity about the accuracy of fully automated inference on criminality,” the introductory passage read.
“We and the writers have no difference in values. They have distorted our original intention and set up an imaginary enemy,” Wang said.",'% Deep Learning%'

""We used to see artificial intelligence only as a way to improve our computing and processing abilities. But, actually, AI can use data for self study and make our rules,"" said Ma Huateng, chairman and CEO of Tencent, at the China IT Summit in Shenzhen on Sunday.
In March 2016, Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo scored a 4-1 victory over South Korean Go master Lee Se-dol in a five-round showdown. The machine's victory was noted by AI enthusiasts around the world.
Tencent developed its own AI program Jueyi, which has scored several victories in matches around the world.
""If we develop a simulator, define its parameters, let it fully explore, study and make mistakes, programs will make out how things work, far exceeding our imagination,"" Ma said.
Ma said Chinese IT companies were actively developing AI.
""Many companies are taking cities and seizing territories,"" Ma said.
Internet giant Baidu set up a national deep learning technology lab in Beijing in March. The lab gathered AI experts from Baidu, Tsinghua University, Beihang University and the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.
""The Internet is just an appetizer. The main course will be AI. In the future, machines will develop to a point where they can understand humans and their intentions,"" said Li Yanhong, chair of Baidu.
Baidu has invested heavily in machine-aided study, image recognition, voice recognition and driverless vehicles.
""AI will be a magnanimous industry and will last for a very long time. I'm certain that the industry will develop fast in the next 20 to 50 years,"" Li said.
At a separate AI conference in Beijing last week, Zhang Yongqiang, deputy director of Zhongguancun Management Committee, said the AI industry would see a ""new age,"" promoted by many government policies.
In May last year, the government made a three-year action plan to develop AI.
The industry market size was 23.9 billion yuan (about 3.5 billion U.S. dollars) last year, and will reach 38 billion yuan (about 5.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 2018, according to the China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
AI has been applied widely in security, finance and medical fields. DeepGlint is a Beijing-based company which has developed a smart video surveillance system, which will help police track suspects.
""If you upload facial images, or other information such as clothing, height, body size and car license plate number, into the system, it will scan hours of video for matches,"" said Zhao Yong, DeepGlint founder. ""It is impossible for police officers to scan millions of hours of video footage to locate a suspect, but it is possible for the system to do it.""
""Machines can do what people can't. We must make machines our best partner, rather than letting them replace us,"" said Jack Ma, founder of Internet commerce giant Alibaba.

Artificially intelligent (AI) algorithms can learn to identify amazingly subtle information, enabling them to distinguish between people in photos or to screen medical images as well as a doctor. However, such feats relies on training that involves thousands to trillions of data points in most cases and AI doesn't work all that well in situations where there is very little data, such as drug development.
Vijay Pande, professor of chemistry at Stanford University, and his students thought that a fairly new kind of deep learning, called one-shot learning, that requires only a small number of data points might be a solution. ""We're trying to use machine learning, especially deep learning, for the early stage of drug design,"" said Pande. ""The issue is, once you have thousands of examples in drug design, you probably already have a successful drug.""
By applying one-shot learning to drug design problems, as the data was likely too limited, their findings published Monday in ACS Central Science show that the methods have potential as a helpful tool for drug development and other areas of chemistry research.
To make molecular information more digestible, the researchers first represented each molecule in terms of the connections between atoms. This step highlighted intrinsic properties of the chemical in a form that an algorithm could process.
With these graphical representations, the group trained an algorithm on two different datasets -- one with information about the toxicity of different chemicals and another that detailed side effects of approved medicines.
From the first dataset, they trained the algorithm on six chemicals and had it make predictions about the toxicity of the other three. Using the second dataset, they trained it to associate drugs with side effects in 21 tasks, testing it on six more.
In both cases, the algorithm was better able to predict toxicity or side effects than would have been possible by chance. ""We worked on some prototype algorithms and found that, given a few data points, they were able to make predictions that were pretty accurate,"" Bharath Ramsundar, who is a graduate student in the Pande lab and co-lead author of the study, was quoted as saying in a news release from Stanford, a private school in Northern California on the U.S. West Coast.
However, Ramsundar cautioned that this isn't a ""magical"" technique. It was built off of several recent advances in a particular style of one-shot learning and it works by relying on the closeness of different molecules, as indirectly indicated by their formula. For example, when the researchers trained their algorithm on the toxicity data and tested it on the side effect data, the algorithm completely collapsed.
The researchers envision this as groundwork for a potential tool for chemists who are early in their research and trying to choose which molecule to pursue from a set of promising candidates. ""Right now, people make this kind of choice by hunch,"" Ramsundar said. ""This might be a nice compliment to that: an experimentalist's helper.""
Beyond giving insight into drug design, this tool would be broadly applicable to molecular chemistry. Already, the Pande lab is testing these methods on different chemical compositions for solar cells. They have also made all of the code they used for the experiment open source, available as part of the DeepChem library.

Zhongguancun, known in some quarters as ""China's Silicon Valley,"" has offered permanent-residence certificates in China to more than 280 foreigners since 2016.
Jahangir Raza from Pakistan just graduated from North China Electric Power University. He is working in the capital as a service manager for Beijing Aeonmed and is getting his work visa in China.
He expects a lot from his future career, and says he decided to stay in Beijing because of the great opportunities here.
Yang Zhongwei, International Marketing & Sales Director of Beijing Aeonmed, said the company would like to hire overseas staff because they can become the strong link between overseas markets and Chinese companies.
From common entrepreneurs to Nobel laureates, an increasing number of foreigners see Beijing as an ideal place for their business ideas.
THOMAS Beijing Research and Development Center was founded in Beihang University this February. The center named after Professor Thomas C. Sudhof, a winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, was jointly founded by the city of Beijing, Beihang University and Professor Thomas C. Sudhof.
Focusing on repairing central nervous system injuries, the center has a multidisciplinary advantage and undertakes research into many areas, including pathophysiology, biomaterial modification, preparation techniques and repairing neural injuries.
Nils Pihl, a tech CEO in Beijing, born in Sweden, moved to Silicon Valley and then New York, but founded a tech startup in Beijing.
He wrote an article for the Business Insider, an American news website, to explain why he chose Beijing for his startup. Pihl believes Beijing is great for innovation.
""Beijing offered us cheap housing and food, a network of experienced mentors that were happy to take the time to help, steady access to some of the world's greatest engineering talent at a sixth of the cost of a junior engineer in Silicon Valley and access to a vast market of clients,"" he wrote.
Though for Pihl it was never about costs alone.
""Beijing attracts large numbers of truly driven, creative and interesting people,"" he wrote.",'% natural language processing%'

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba surpassed its US counterpart Amazon as the world's biggest e-commerce company on October 11 after the Hangzhou-headquartered company established the DAMO Academy, a new research institute, on the same day.
It is the second time Alibaba has exceeded Amazon in terms of market value. The first time happened three years ago when Alibaba listed.
The internet giant has also pledged to invest more than 100 billion yuan (about $15.1 billion) over the next three years in advanced technology development.
The DAMO Academy is said to have a connection with its founder Jack Ma’s love for kung fu stories. In Chinese novels, the Damo Academy is a top martial arts institution.
“DAMO” has rich connotations in the Chinese language: It’s the Chinese name for Bodhidharma, a Buddhist monk from India, who once meditated and practiced martial arts at Shaolin Temple in Henan Province. Zen, a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang Dynasty as Chan Buddhism, started with Bodhidharma.
According to Alibaba, DAMO stands for ""discovery, adventure, momentum and outlook,"" and the institute will focus on fundamental science and disruptive technological innovation.
With an ambition of serving at least 2 billion users worldwide, Ma expects the academy to outlive Alibaba and be able to solve problems with future-oriented technologies.
The academy will research quantum computing, machine learning, basic algorithms, network security, visual computing, natural language processing, human-machine interaction, chip technology, sensor technology and embedded systems.
The institute has begun to set up cutting-edge research centers and laboratories for different research areas around the globe.
It will recruit 100 researchers from around the world in the preliminary stage. George Church, a leading light of the Human Genome Project, and Michael I. Jordan, a mastermind in artificial intelligence, have joined the team.",'% natural language processing%'

The Sri Lankan cabinet has granted approval for a multi billion dollar China funded Port City project to recommence work in the capital after it was suspended by the government last March.
Minister of International Trade Malik Samarawickrema said that the government would next week send an official letter to the Chinese investors funding the project to begin work.
""They can go ahead and start work as all our matters pertaining to the project have been resolved. Next week we will officially inform the Chinese company,"" Samarawickrema said.
The project is being funded by China Communication Construction Company Limited (CCCC).
The 1.4 billion dollar project which will be the first of its kind in South Asia began construction adjacent to the Galle Face Green and near the Colombo Harbour in September 2014 under the previous government. However, it was suspended by the new government of President Maithripala Sirisena in March last year, six months after it began construction, The new government said that the project needed to be reviewed.
The Port City is expected to boost the local economy by generating millions of dollars, It will create over 10,000 jobs.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the island nation would have a ""unique financial and business district"" in Colombo when the Port City resumes work.
The project includes a marina and yacht club, a central boulevard, a sea view apartment complex and a five-star hotel, shopping and entertainment center, office space, a mini golf course, and many other modern facilities.

Niroshan Perera, state minister of national policies and economic affairs, said in a recent interview with Xinhua that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will discuss prospects of attracting new investments during his visit to China in April.
And the two sides will also discuss the implementation of a free trade agreement (FTA) and the commencement of infrastructure projects which Sri Lanka believes will help boost its slow paced economy, the state minister added
Perera said that during the visit, which will be Wickremesinghe's first since winning a parliamentary election in August, the prime minister will also look to further strengthen political ties with China.
""This will be a very crucial visit which will set the tone for the next couple of years,"" Perera said.
""Also as you know, we are negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with China, so we hope that all these projects will come together by the end of the year along with the investments. Thereafter we hope to have a strong economic partnership with China.""
One of the key issues which will also be on Wickremesinghe's agenda, will be to discuss a multi-billion-dollar Port City project funded by China, which was suspended by the new government of President Maithripala Sirisena in March last year.
The project which had begun under construction in September 2014 was suspended as the government said the project needed to be reviewed.
Sri Lankan leaders recently announced that it will go ahead with the project, which would be the first of its kind in South Asia.
""Negotiations are ongoing so as soon as we reach an agreement, the project will begin work. It can even be before the Prime Minister leaves for China,"" Perera said.
Reiterating that Sri Lanka's relations with China have been strong, Perera said ties have now been strengthened further after the new government came into power last year.
He said most of the Chinese-funded projects which had been suspended, have now been given the nod and their construction have begun.
""When we were talking to the Chinese government, there was no misunderstanding. It was only that we had to review some of the projects which took some time. But I think we can move on now and it is good for China and Sri Lanka to further strengthen their ties.""
Perera noted that while the government was in the process of setting up a special industrial zone at Hambantota in the south of the country for Chinese investors, the government invited China to invest in other areas including the former war torn north and east too.
Sri Lanka hopes to be part of China's Belt and Road initiative, saying this would lead to further economic corporation between the two countries.
Perera will lead a 100-member youth delegation to China next week in order to educate the future generation on China's development.

Mangala Samaraweera is on a two-day China visit, the first by a Sri Lankan minister since Sri Lanka's new government took office in January, and it comes after the government decided to re-examine arrangements to build the 1.4-billion-U.S.-dollar project.
On Feb. 5, it allowed the project to continue after an environmental assessment study. But last week, Sri Lanka said it would reconsider the outright transfer of a parcel of land to China under the deal.
The re-examination is not targeted at China, as Sri Lanka does the same with projects funded by other countries, Samaraweera told reporters. ""Anything relating to Chinese investment will be shared and discussed with the government of China before we take any final decision,"" he said.
""We will always welcome Chinese investment as one of the emerging superpowers in the world,"" Samaraweera said when meeting with the press along with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi after their talks on Friday.
Chinese investment has increased tenfold in the last several years, Samaraweera said. ""We hope that with the new reforms in Sri Lanka, more transparency of the government and restoration of rule of law, Chinese investors will find Sri Lanka an even more attractive destination for investment than ever before.""

China’s claimsare based on sufficient historic and legal bases and are under the protection of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and other international laws. However, the legitimacy of these rights was denied in the final award given by the arbitral tribunal.
The tribunal concluded that “to the extent China had historic rights to resources in the waters of the South China Sea, such rights were extinguished to the extent they were incompatible with the exclusive economic zones (EEZ) provided for in the Convention.” “There wasno legal basis for China to claim historic rights to resources within the sea areas falling within the ‘nine-dash line.'”
China’s historic rights had come into existence long before the conclusion of the Convention. Words like “history”, “historic”, and “historical” repeatedly appear throughout the Convention. When defining a country’s lawful sea rights, international law dictates that historic rightsshould be given prior consideration.
Because of the complexity of states’ historic rights, the authors didn’t develop a universal definition of these rights in the Convention and didn’t intend to replace them with the rules of the Convention either. On the contrary, the Convention gave full respect to the historic rights and decided that they should be regulated by general international law. For example, Article 298 says that a state may declare in writing that it does not accept any compulsory arbitration procedures with respect to disputes concerning sea boundary delimitations or those involving historic bays or titles. The tribunal’s application of articles concerning historic rights clearly exceeded the limits of power permitted by the Convention, which has been criticized by law experts in and outside China.
Hu Dekun, dean of Wuhan University China Institute of Boundary and Ocean Studies, said that China’s sovereignty and maritime rights in the South China Sea formed and evolved over a long course of history. Prior to the signing of the Convention, in 1948 the Chinese government officially published a dashed-line map to clarify its claims to the territorial sovereignty and maritime rights of the Nansha Islands and the surrounding waters.
“Is there anything at all in the Convention saying that a right should be extinguished simply because of its incompatibility with the Convention? Is there any precedent set by the International Court of Justice’s rulings? The tribunal’s decision is clearly a misinterpretation of the Convention and the arbitrators showed their poor knowledge of the history of the South China Sea. ” said Jia Yu, deputy director of Institute for Ocean Development Strategy Studies at China’s State Oceanic Administration.
Jia added that the Convention is a piece of the international law and on its own cannot contain all rules concerning maritime rights. The Convention made clear that whatit failed to cover should be regulated by general international law, which is the source of the historic rights.
Lei Xiaolu, fellow at China’s Collaborative Innovation Center for Territorial Sovereignty and Maritime Rights, said that the tribunal made many egregious technical mistakes concerning China’s historic rights in the South China Sea.
First of all, the tribunal overstepped its own jurisdiction to decide on the dashed line matter. The arbitration was initiated by the Philippines to settle the dispute with China in the South China Sea, and should have strictly considered issues related to the dispute. The area falling within the “nine-dash line” goes beyond the scope of the disputed area; nevertheless, the tribunal accepted Manila’s position and issued a decision on this point–clearly a violation of general principles and practice of international arbitration.
Secondly, the tribunal’s perception of China’s historic rights in the dashed-line area is biased. In a diplomatic note delivered to the Foreign Ministry of the Philippines in 2011, the Chinese embassy in Manila protested the country’s bid for exploring oil and gas deposits in areas of the South China Sea where China enjoys historic rights. To serve its pre-determined conclusions, the tribunal dismissed China’s position and ruled that the term “historic rights” used in that note was a “translation error”. The bias here is evident. A ruling made out of mistakes lacks of justice.
Third, the tribunal’s decision over historic rights ignored the general rules of international law based on its misinterpretation of the Convention.
One crucialquestion facing the tribunal is whether the Convention allows the preservation of rights to resources which are at variance with the Convention and established anterior to its entry into force. To answer this, it is necessary to examine the relationship between the Convention and other possible sources of rights under international law. The tribunal claimed that it has done just this, according to Article 311. The problem is what Article 311 sets out is the Convention’s relationship with other international agreements, rather than with general international law. The tribunal expanded Article 311’s scope of applicability.
The Convention affirms in the preamble that matters not regulated by the Convention continue to be governed by the rules and principles of general international law. The tribunal’s decision is a slap to the Convention’s respect for general international law.
Many foreign experts also recognize China’s historic rights in the South China Sea. Surachai Sirikrai, professor of political science at Thammasat University in Bangkok, said that Chinese people had more than 2,000 years of history in the South China Sea. China was the first to discover, name, develop, conduct economic activities on and exercise jurisdiction over the Nansha Islands. China’s historic rights deserve the recognition of international law. Ken Meyercord, an American TV producer and writer, told People’s Daily that Chinese fishermen have developed a set of rules to name land features in Nansha Islands. Activities like this can be found in many written records.
The Chinese government issued a statement reasserting China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights in the South China Sea shortly after the award’s release. “Big as China is, we cannot afford to give away a single inch of territory that our ancestors have left to us,” said State Councilor Yang Jiechi. The decision cannot change the facts, and thus will not affect China's claims and resolution to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights.",'% siri%'

Apple Inc will set up a research and development center in China by the end of this year?its first independently-operated one in the Asia-Pacific region?as part of its efforts to regain market share it is losing to local rivals.
Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Tuesday that the US tech giant would step up its investments in China and be an active part in promoting the country's smart manufacturing and Internet Plus strategy, which are designed to advance the use of the internet in traditional industries.
Cook revealed the company's plan during a meeting with Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli. Cook's second visit to Beijing within three months highlighted the importance of the Chinese market where the tech giant is wrestling with declining iPhone sales.
The company did not disclose the investment size for the new R& D center.
In a separate app developer event on Tuesday, Cook said his company would add more China-specific features to its mobile operating system, in a move to further differentiate its products.
The move comes as smartphones increasingly look and work the same, and services and software become increasingly important to help companies differentiate their products and win brand loyalty.
Currently, Apple's intelligent personal assistant Siri is learning ancient Chinese poems and when Chinese consumers speak some of their words, Siri will be able to recognize which poems they are from and tell users the names of the poets.
During his latest visits to China, Cook had extensive meetings with local developers, highlighting his emphasis on offering better services.
James Yan, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research, said: ""Smartphone hardware is no longer Apple's edge, because local vendors such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd are catching up quickly, and even outdoing Apple in hardware components, such as having dual cameras on one smartphone,"" Yan said.
In May, Cook said his company would speed up its efforts to let Chinese-developed mobile applications go global, as local developers raked in earnings exceeding $7 billion from the company's App Store.
Cook's visit also came ahead of the company's new iPhone launch, which will take place in the fall and is widely seen as the key to helping Apple regain its crown in China.
Jin Di, research manager at International Data Corp China, said during the visit Cook would probably discuss cooperation deals with retail partners, including telecom carriers.

Even as rumors swirl around the upcoming release of the next iPhone, the release of the public beta version of iOS 9 has also caused a stir among Apple users.
The new feature of Apple Maps, which can help Chinese users to navigate from point A to point B via public transport, such as bus, subway, or train, will be fully operational in more than 300 Chinese cities this fall.
The debut of Apple Maps was met with considerable criticism due to system bugs and mapping errors in 2012, so, after making a number of transit-focused acquisitions, the company has attempted to provide a service that can rival Google Maps as well as domestic brand Baidu Maps.
As one of the selective Chinese media outlets, China Daily was invited to take part in a tour to explore the public transit function of Apple Maps, which comes preinstalled in the brand's latest mobile system.
Press members who were gathered at the Apple Store of Beijing's Xidan Joy City, were asked to navigate to Aloft Hotel in the Haidian district of the city by using Apple Maps.
The route simulated the experience of a first-time visitor to Beijing, being able to navigate without asking for directions. All you needed to get around was a iPhone with a 4G LTE SIM card.
Thanks to Gaode Maps, or amap.com, who is the location database provider for Apple Maps, users can type their target destination into the app, and it will calculate the optimal travel route.
Whether traveling within a city or across the country, Apple Maps will provide detailed routes including bus stops, subway stations, train stations and the walking distance between different forms of transport.
It also provides customized options for users to choose departure date and time to calculate an optimal travel solution.
When you need to get off your bus to get to the next leg of your journey, the app will prompt you ahead of time in case you miss your stop.
Compared with the original Gaode maps, which had voice search input and estimated fare functions for public transit, Apple's maps make use of its voice-activated assistant, Siri, to support the audio search while no specific commuting fees will be shown for any planned routes.
And of course, there are still shortcomings to be improved, for example information about ferry or flight services are so far not provided and the potential value of online to offline businesses that could be listed on Location Based Services has not been explored at this moment.

The company traditionally announces its new iPhones in September.
Apple is widely expected to unveil the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6 Plus S. Typically, the company launches upgraded versions to existing phones under the ""S"" range.

Arabella is not the first foreign kid famous for her proficiency in Chinese. Learning Chinese has already become a new trend in royal families. Elisabeth, 16-year-old Princess of Belgium, studied Chinese in a Dutch speaking school in Brussels.
Such a move also happened in the neighboring Dutch monarchy. Catharina Amalia, the heir to the Dutch throne, started learning Chinese in Hague in 2016.
Meanwhile, the Danish monarchy is another European royal family which has shown a keen interest in China and its culture and language. Apart from Danish, French, and English, Chinese is among one of the four languages used on the royal family’s website since 2014.
Chinese also appears to be a popular second language in Asian royal families. Princess Sirindhorn has been learning about Chinese culture and arts and has been studying Chinese language for years. Her proficiency in Chinese has earned her a title of “good friend of China,” enabling her to be a true envoy for Sino-Thai relations.

NEW DELHI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- In its biggest space diplomacy push, Indian launched a South Asia communication satellite on Friday from the spaceport of Sriharikota in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.
The State-owned Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) rocket, Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), carrying the 2,230 kg satellite GSAT-9, lifted off from the launch pad at Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota at 4:57 p.m. local time (1127 GMT).
ISRO, which has built the satellite for use by countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region, said GSAT-9 has been launched with an objective to provide different communication applications in Ku-band with coverage over South Asia.
The satellite was originally named SAARC satellite, but was later changed to South Asia satellite after Pakistan opted out of the project, stating ""it has its own space program.""
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the country's scientists for the successful launch. ""We are a united family of South Asian countries, united in our pursuit of peace, progress & prosperity of our region & the entire humankind,"" he tweeted soon after the launch.
Later joining the five heads of state of SAARC nations -- Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Maldives President Abdulla Yameen, Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena -- Modi hailed the launch.
""Today is a historic day, one without precedent. We extend our close links into Outer Space. Space technology will touch the lives of our people in the region. Convinced when we join hands and mutually share fruits of knowledge, technology and growth, we can speed up development,"" he said.
On his part, Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani said: ""This is an extremely important step to know nature and nature's patterns. Development must be citizen centric. Today's development is child centred and women centred, it makes governance accessible.""
Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took the opportunity to thank India. ""On today's auspicious occasion, I congratulate the Government of India (for the successful launch). Betterment of our people can happen through fruitful engagement,"" she said.
Modi, who had first announced the project during the 2014 SAARC Summit in Nepal as a gift to the regional countries, spelled out the date of launch of the satellite in his monthly radio program, Mann ki baat (talk from the heart) Sunday.
The satellite has 12 Ku-band transponders. It is cuboid in shape and built around a central cylinder has a mission life of over 12 years.
It is expected to help communicate during disasters and also focus on telemedicine and education. Each country can beam its own TV programs while there will be the possibility for a common South Asia programming.",'% siri%'

He also highlighted the friendly relationship between the countries and offered all-out support to the Sri Lankan government and help with the disaster relief effort.
Xi said he was confident the Sri Lankan government and the people will overcome the disaster and rebuild their country.
Premier Li Keqiang also sent a message of condolence to Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Sunday.
The message of support came as emergency teams rushed to distribute aid to half a million people who have been displaced by the flooding, as authorities upgraded the death toll to 151.
The official Disaster Management Centre said 111 people were still missing, with 95 injured in hospital, since torrential rain and landslides swept away entire villages.
Floodwaters were receding in some areas after a break in the rain, giving authorities a chance to deliver much-needed supplies to victims who lost everything in the deluge.
Heavy rains on Friday triggered the worst flooding and landslides in 14 years in the southern and western parts of the island.
Many villages were still underwater on Sunday, officials said.
Nearly 2,000 houses were damaged or completely destroyed. Almost half a million Sri Lankans had been forced from their homes, with most moving into temporary shelters.
The charity Save the Children said about a tenth of those displaced were children below the age of five years.
It said that the stagnant floodwaters provide the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes and could exacerbate the dengue crisis that has seen an almost 150 percent increase in cases compared to the same period last year.
""The humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka right now is alarming. The impact of these early monsoon season downpours has been far more devastating than what we'd normally expect this time of the year,"" Save the Children's Chris McIvor said.

""When I was a child, I met a stroke patient who had been healed by acupuncture,"" said 28-year-old Siriteerathitikul. ""I was astonished and have been attracted by the magical therapy ever since.""
In 2015, the Thai student came to Guangxi Medical University in Nanning, capital city of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, to study traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
Acupuncture is just one therapy included under the umbrella of TCM, which has a history of over 2,000 years. It involves insertion of fine metal needles on the body at specific points to help balance the body's energy flow.
""I study acupuncture with my classmates, and we insert needles into each other,"" said Siriteerathitikul. ""That's the best way to master the technique.""
In addition to acupuncture, she also uses cupping to help those suffering from back or neck pain. The therapy involves placing cups on the patient's skin to create suction which improves blood circulation.
""Foreigners are skeptical about TCM because they don't know much about this ancient healing art, and that's the major challenge for its development outside China,"" said Ling Jianghong, deputy director of TCM department at First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University.
Ling said that TCM and Western medicine have different strengths, and the curative effects of TCM need to be promoted so that it can bring benefits to patients worldwide.
At present, governments of 86 countries and regions have signed agreements on TCM cooperation with China as the techniques gain more recognition globally.
Convinced of its benefits, a growing number of international fans have come to China on medical tours to experience the therapies
Located in the southern China island of Hainan, Sanya Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital was the first Chinese hospital to carry out TCM medical tourism programs, beginning in 2002.
The hospital had treated more than 25,000 foreign patients from countries including Russia, Sweden, Norway and Austria by 2015, according to an introduction on its website.
In 2015, TCM medical and health centers across China received 910 million patient visits and TCM therapies have been given in 183 countries and regions worldwide, according to China's first white paper on TCM published by the State Council Information Office last year.
The World Health Organization said that 103 member states have granted approval for the practices of acupuncture and moxibustion, the burning of dried mugwort near the patient's skin, while 18 have included acupuncture and moxibustion treatment in their medical insurance provisions.

BEIJING, April 17 -- China's leading home appliance maker Haier is determined to become a leader in the Internet age.
In a few short years, the Haier Group has quietly built up Internet-based smart factories, where mass production of personalized products has replaced the company's traditional large-scale manufacturing.
The new smart factories allow users to personalize appliances by communicating their needs directly with the manufacturer through Haier's new app ""U+ Smart Living"".
By logging on they can specify customizations and get pricing on changes such as larger control screens, different colors and noise reduction for washing machines. In one instance, a customer was able to order an air-conditioner that filtered methanol. The app also allows customers to offer suggestions which will be considered by Haier's global design team.
The technology is already in place at a factory producing web-connected air conditioners in Zhengzhou city and a refrigerator factory in Shenyang. Two more smart factories, one producing washing machines in Foshan and the other making water heaters in Qingdao, are expected to begin operation this year.
The tailor-made products have been a huge hit with customers, Li Pan, vice president of Haier's home appliance industry, said.
The new ""U+ Smart living"" app also allows users to control web-connected household appliances through their mobile device. The company plans on releasing a new Internet-connected refrigerator using Google's Android operating system in June, Li said.
With a slowing economy and rising labor costs weighing on sales and squeezing profit margins, Haier is not the only Chinese company looking to the Internet to gain an edge, but it appears to be among the most advanced.
It is the first and only Chinese brand working with Apple to employ their HomeKit platform, which can use Siri voice commands to control home devices.
Haier's strategy stems is based on their vision of business in an Internet-dominated future, where users' experience is of great significance, Haier Group chairman Zhang Ruimin said.
It is part of a continual process of reinvention that dates back to 1984, when Zhang was appointed the head of the then struggling state-owned fridge factory.
In 1985, Zhang handed out sledgehammers and joined the staff in smashing 76 faulty fridges in public, which signified the firm's quest for quality and was the start of its transformation.
Riding on China's economic rise, Haier has secured its market share at home and was the first Chinese brand to spread its wings abroad.
Unlike many Chinese firms, Haier did not start its international expansion by purchasing overseas assets or by entering other emerging economies. It first targeted niche markets neglected by Western manufacturers, like mini fridges and wine coolers.
Haier now owns design and production assets on five continents. Last month, it started operating its largest overseas research and development center in Japan's Saitama Prefecture, focusing on fundamental research, new product planning and key technology design over white appliances.
With a 10.2 percent global market share, Haier has ranked the world's No. 1 major home appliance brand for the sixth consecutive year, according to a 2014 ranking by Euromonitor International, a leading consumer market strategy research.
Net profits at its Shanghai-listed Qingdao Haier jumped 19.6 percent year on year in 2014 to 4.99 billion yuan (812.7 million U.S. dollars). Its Hong Kong-listed unit, Haier Electronics, posted a 20 percent rise in net profit last year to 2.45 billion yuan.",'% siri%'

Representatives of Shanghai Yishijia Network Technology Co., Ltd filed a lawsuit against Apple and Shanghai Woshang Information technology Co., Ltd over the usage right of a trademark Yishijia owns on Apple's App Store, and are asking for compensation of more than 100 million yuan (about 16 million U.S. dollars), according to the Shanghai No.1 Intermediate People's Court. The court has accepted the lawsuit.
The dispute began in April, when Yishijia applied to upload the mobile application for Homevv, an online shopping platform that it developed, on the App Store, but was rejected by Apple as another app bearing the same trademark by Woshang was already there.
Yishijia, which has owned the trademark of Homevv since 2010, asked Apple to take Woshang's app off the store multiple times but was rejected.
Citing the loss of clients and market share, Yishijia demands that Apple remove Woshang's app from the App Store, and that Woshang stop using the trademark of Homevv. It also demands a public apology from the two companies.
Apple has faced a spate of lawsuits in China in recent years.
In 2013, Shanghai Zhizhen Network Technology Co, the developer of voice-recognition technology Xiao i Robot, accused the U.S. tech giant of intellectual property right infringement regarding software used in its popular Siri software.
In 2012, Apple stood trial in Beijing for allegedly selling unlicensed electronic versions of books by eight Chinese writers via the App Store.",'% siri%'

Professors Chun Kalim from Hoseo University of South Korea said that China and the U.S. are two big powers in the world. It is reasonable and necessary to build a new era of relations between big powers in line with the current situation, which will also play a crucial role in maintaining world peace.
The China-U.S. dialogue process is a process of closer exchange and cooperation which will be helpful for the two sides to understand each other's positions as well as to clear up contradictions and unpleasantness. It is worth mentioning that the China-U.S. cultural exchanges and dialogue are to be elevated to the same level as the strategic and economic position, which is a major breakthrough.
The Yonhap News agency reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping at the opening ceremony repeatedly mentioned the establishment of a new-type China-U.S. relations, and noted that China and the U.S. should respect each other's choice of the development path. The two sides have reached agreement on cooperation in various fields, with plenty of achievements made.
Veteran Indian strategic analyst Ramesh Chopra said the dialogue is conducive to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the world.
He said the United States and China can hold dialogue and coordination on various issues despite their differences.
Both China and the United States are economic giants and East, Southeast as well as South Asia can benefit immensely by interacting bilaterally as well as multi-laterally in the fields of economy and development to derive maximum advantage, Chopra said.
Russia's Kommersant daily newspaper published on Thursday an article titled ""American diplomacy turns to China,"" in which it said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's visit to China for the S&ED is seen as a step to build a new model of major-country relations between China and the United States, which was raised by the two countries' leaders last year.
The S&ED proved that the United States saw the economic cooperation between China as a top priority.
Progress was registered in negotiations on the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), which helps solve the problems of trade imbalance, the exchange rate of the Chinese yuan, investment restrictions and so on.
World News published in the Philippines reported that, through the joint efforts, the annual China-U.S. dialogue has scored more than 300 achievements of cooperation and achieved perfect success.
As the largest developed country and the largest developing country in the world, although the two countries face conflicts of interest, they have common interests in various fields including denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the international fight against terrorism, the nuclear issue of Iran, the international financial crisis and climate changes, the newspaper said.
Strengthening communications and reducing frictions will benefit both countries, it said.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao newspaper said China and the United States had seen frequent frictions over the past year and the dialogue created an opportunity for the two sides to cushion the blow and ""cool down"" tensions.
The paper said the dialogue had already made breakthroughs on important issues such as currency reform and BIT.
In another article, the paper said the economic dialogue yielded over 90 items of agreement and the most remarkable progress is that both sides agreed to resolve core issues and major provisions of BIT.
Although the two failed to reach agreements over cyber security and maritime disputes, it showcased the complicated ""cooperative and contradictory"" relationship between the two giant economies.
Sin Chew Daily, a Malaysian Chinese-language newspaper, reported that China and the United States had reached an agreement that the two countries' leaders would continue to maintain regular communication.
At the same time, it said that China and the United States had agreed to promote their cooperation in fields like anti-terrorism, law enforcement, anti-corruption, customs, fishery, maritime affairs, energy and climate changes, security, etc.
Thailand's Sirinakorn Daily News quoted academics as saying that China and the U.S. should take good advantage of this dialogue to reshape bilateral relations and create a positive momentum for development.
An article posted on the website of MCOT, a Thai-language media group, said that the relations between China and the United States have much bearing on global peace and stability.
Both countries have expected to take this opportunity to improve their relations, further promote economic and security cooperation and prevent disagreements from exerting negative impact, it said.",'% siri%'

The struggle for bots to mimic idiomatic language means it can be pretty easy to spot. That shows how hard it is for researchers to develop a human-like chatbot.

But now, some researchers in China are moving one step closer, after creating a chatbot with five different mood types.
The moods include happiness, sadness, anger, disgust and loving. The bot can reply to people's words differently, according to the mood it has been set on.
A leader of the project, Professor Huang Minlie at Tsinghua University, calls the bot an ""Emotional Chatting Machine"" (ECM).
He typed a critical comment about Valentine's Day into the machine as a test. The machine replied ""Happy Valentines Day!"" when set on a happy mood, and complained ""you're just showing off!"" when set to angry mode.
""It's still an initial exploration in the area, as ECMs can only talk in text. It doesn't have a voice output or facial expressions,"" Huang told Xinhua.
""But researches are moving rapidly on creating human emotions,"" he added.
So how do ECMs work? The research team created an emotion classification algorithm, and used it to classify all kinds of comments on social media websites.
So words from an ECM could be lifted from something you said online last week, and that's why their reactions sound so much more human-like than other bots.",'% chatbot%'

Driverless cars are the most significant development so far for the company. A spokesperson has said that they hope to put the car into commercial use within three years, and to enter mass production within five years. However, whether the car will put into commercial use depends largely on cost. A car-based radar on the driverless car that finished testing last year cost 700,000 yuan.
Wang said the company is working with its partner, attempting to bring the cost of the radar down to less than 20,000 yuan within the next three to five years. So far, the cost has been lowered to under 500,000 yuan. Wang said that the cost of a driverless car will only be 20 to 33 percent of the cost of manned cars.

The news that Baidu will participate in a citywide trial of autonomous vehicles signals the latest move in the internet giant's plans to become a major player in the burgeoning market.
Under a five-year agreement between China's biggest search engine and the city of Wuhu in the eastern province of Anhui, the company's autonomous cars, buses and vans will gradually be introduced to selected roads and zones before eventually being allowed to use public highways throughout the city. The vehicles will not carry passengers during the first three years of the trial period.
The agreement has seen Baidu potentially steal a march on its rivals in the sector, which was kick-started by Google's self-driving-car program in 2009. Since then, automobile manufacturers such as BMW, Volvo and Toyota have all become leading lights in the race to commercialize so-called robocars.
Now, as basic self-driving technologies become more mature, companies in the world's largest auto market are anxious to deepen their involvement in the sector.
""Currently, the major bottlenecks in replacing human drivers with robots lie in cost reductions, the upgrading of the transportation infrastructure and legal issues. China, which has a large automobile market and higher acceptance of self-driving technology, will have a competitive advantage,"" said Jack Yu, general manager of ResearchInChina, an auto industry consultancy in Beijing.
The race is just starting. Ahead of the Beijing Auto Show, which ran from April 25 to May 4, Chang'an Automobile sent two driverless cars on a six-day, 2,000-kilometer test journey from Chongqing in the southwest to the Chinese capital in the north.
In early April, the Swedish carmaker Volvo, which is owned by Zhejiang Geely Holdings?headquartered in Hangzhou, in the province of Zhejiang in East China?announced a plan to launch a self-driving experiment involving as many as 100 cars.
Chinese tech giants, such as Baidu and LeAuto?a subsidiary of Leshi Internet Information &Technology?are also engaged in self-driving technologies. Baidu started a research program in July 2014, and undertook its first fully automatic road test in December, while LeAuto unveiled the LeSEE, its concept driverless vehicle, on April 20.
""Worldwide, self-driving technologies are becoming mature. I'm optimistic that it will only be five years or so before we will be able to buy self-driving cars,"" Yu said.

U.K. authorities have invited China to test self-driving cars on British roads, as such a move can deepen the two countries’ cooperation in the realm of intelligent vehicles.
Self-driving cars represent the future of the auto industry. The U.K. is willing to cooperate with countries including China to set an international standard for driverless vehicles, Mark Wareing, counselor and strategy director at UK Trade & Investment, told Thepaper.cn in an interview.
Future products will require an open economic climate, as well as conditions that encourage cooperation, which the U.K. can offer, Wareing added.
“The intelligent car industry in China has developed quickly in recent years, yet it still faces challenges, as the country lacks laws and standards for driverless cars,” said Gao Hesheng, vice director of China Automotive Technology & Research Center.
“In order to ensure the reliability and practicability [of our products], driverless car tests should take place on real roads. Some countries can provide commercial license plates to such test cars - a service that is currently unavailable in China. Without tests, research on intelligent cars will be hindered,” said Li Wei, vice president of Chongqing Chang'an Automobile Co. Ltd.
According to Wareing, the U.K. has a mature system of laws and insurance when it comes to intelligent cars. Companies don’t need special permission to run tests, as long as they have insurance.
The U.K. government is providing £19 million to launch four driverless car schemes in four locations, hoping that the U.K. will become a world leader in the self-driving vehicle market, which could be worth £900 billion by 2025, according to a KPMG study.",'% driverless car%'

Internet giant makes big investment in US lidar sensor maker
Baidu Inc has added fuel to its effort to put driverless cars into mass production within five years with its multimillion dollar investment on Tuesday in a major US producer of lidar sensors, a key technology that helps the cars ""see"" their surrounding environment by using light to measure distance.
California-based Velodyne LiDAR Inc, which provides sensor technology that can help driverless cars, announced that it had completed a combined $150 million investment from Ford Motor Co and Baidu.
Beijing-based Baidu did not disclose the size of its investment. But Ford, which announced on Tuesday its plan to produce fully autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services by 2021, said it invested $75 million in the lidar sensor company.
Velodyne, which was founded in 1983, said in a statement that the investment will help the company expand production and make sensors more affordable for the mass deployment of fully autonomous vehicles.
""We want the cost to be low enough to be used for all cars. We envision a safer world for the millions of automotive drivers across the globe,"" said Marta Hall, Velodyne's president of business development.

""If you're expecting autonomous function where you can be on the highway, pressing the button and the car is doing everything for you, like lane changing and driving and that stuff, and you can play with smartphone, and you're always safe, I mean we had the big announcement with Intel and Mobileye that we will have the i-Next in 2021.""
The ""i"" series, which has two existing models, are electric vehicles manufactured by BMW.
Self-driving vehicles is a field explored by quite a number of automakers as they seek new ways to boost sales.
Google and Apple are also said to be interested in this area.
IHS Automotive, an US auto market analysis company, estimates self-driving vehicles will account for around 10 percent of the global auto market in 2035.
However, it's been suggested by analysts there is still a long way to go to manufacture a completely reliable driverless car.
A fatal car accident in the US state of Florida earlier this year, which involved the autopilot mode of Tesla, a forerunner in exploring self-driving vehicles, has raised concerns about the safety of self-driving vehicles, even though Tesla has avoided using ""self-driving"" to describe its autopilot mode.",'% driverless car%'

BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation to be held from May 14 to 15 in Beijing, could be a dream venue for discussing digital silk road featuring 5G communications, a European digital expert told Xinhua.
""The Belt and Road Forum is the most important event of the year which will bring about a new dynamic of cooperation. It seems the dreamed venue to discuss digital silk road and a common roadmap for 5G,"" said Luigi Gambardella, president of ChinaEU, a business-led international association in Brussels that promotes digital cooperation.
Gambardella said he was invited to the forum and he believes the Belt and Road Initiative could promote global peace and stability by fostering economic growth and integration of participating countries.
""It contrasts with the current economic stagnation in Europe and other regions of the world,"" he added. [ As a digital expert, Gambardella suggested that the discussion of the forum not be limited to railway or other types of physical connection. Building a digital silk road and 5G deployment should be prioritized too.
Speaking highly of the new technology, he defined 5G as a faster wireless broadband with a speed at least 1,000 times compared to 4G network and it enables the connection of all possible electronic devices and makes new services like driverless cars possible.
""5G constitutes a technical revolution which will change people's life greatly. I hope those countries cooperate to design and implement smart 5G cities across the Silk Road,"" Gambardella said.
He called for the establishment of a high-level group of experts for technical support to governments which seek to deploy 5G projects.
""Local governments deserve not only the best 5G infrastructures but a global ecosystem at service level,"" he said.",'% driverless car%'

Zhou Ming, standing deputy dean of Microsoft Research Asia, made the statement in his keynote speech at the 2017 Global Artificial Intelligence Technology Conference, held in Beijing on May 22. Machine translation currently faces challenges that prevent it from reaching the standards of professional translation, Zhou noted. However, he also pointed out that several technology companies are now focusing on machine translation, and have already made great progress.
Google released its translation system in September 2016, based on recurrent neural networks. In addition, the artificial intelligence team at Facebook claimed to have achieved the highest accuracy yet in machine translation by using brand new neural network technology, with a translating speed nine times that of Google.
Apart from translation, Zhou speculated that language-processing technology, integrated with other artificial intelligence, could be applied in many fields including education, medicine and driverless cars in the near future.",'% driverless car%'
