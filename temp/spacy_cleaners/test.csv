For decades, people have been predicting how the rise of advanced computing and robotic technologies will affect our lives. On one side, there are warnings that robots will displace humans in the economy, destroying livelihoods, especially for low-skill workers. Others look forward to the vast economic opportunities that robots will present, claiming, for example, that they will improve productivity or take on undesirable jobs. The venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who recently joined the debate, falls into the latter camp, asserting that robots will save us from a future of high prices and low wages.
Figuring out which side is right requires, first and foremost, an understanding of the six ways that humans have historically created value: through our legs, our fingers, our mouths, our brains, our smiles and our minds. Our legs and other large muscles move things to where we need them to be, so our fingers can rearrange them into useful patterns. Our brains regulate routine activities, keeping the leg- and finger-work on track. Our mouths - indeed, our words, whether spoken or written - enable us to inform and entertain one another. Our smiles help us to connect with others, ensuring that we pull roughly in the same direction. Finally, our minds - our curiosity and creativity - identify and resolve important and interesting challenges.
Thiel, for his part, refutes the argument - often made by robot doomsayers - that the impact of artificial intelligence and advanced robotics on the labor force will mirror globalization's impact on advanced-country workers. Globalization hurt lower-skill workers in places like the US, as it enabled people from faraway countries to compete for the leg-and-finger positions in the global division of labor. Given that these new competitors demanded lower wages, they were the obvious choice for many companies.
According to Thiel, the key difference between this phenomenon and the rise of robots lies in consumption. Developing-country workers took advantage of the bargaining power that globalization afforded them to gain resources for their own consumption. Computers and robots, by contrast, do not consume anything except electricity, even as they complete leg, finger, and even brain activities faster and more efficiently than humans would.
Here, Thiel offers an example from his experience as CEO of PayPal. Instead of having humans scrutinize every item in every batch of 1,000,000 transactions for indications of fraud, PayPal's computers can approve the obviously legitimate transactions, and pass on the 1,000 or so that could be fraudulent for thoughtful consideration by a human. One worker and a computer system can thus do what PayPal would have had to hire 1,000 workers to do a generation ago. Given that the computer system does not need things like food, that thousand-fold increase in productivity will redound entirely to the benefit of the middle class.
Put another way, globalization lowered the wages of low-skill advanced-country workers because others would perform their jobs more cheaply, and then consume the value that they had created. Computers mean that higher-skill workers - and the lower-skill workers who remain to oversee the large robotic factories and warehouses - can spend their time on more valuable activities, assisted by computers that demand little.
Thiel's argument may be correct. But it is far from airtight.
In fact, Thiel seems to be running into the old diamonds-and-water paradox - water is essential, but costs nothing, whereas diamonds are virtually useless, but extremely expensive - albeit in a sophisticated and subtle way. The paradox exists because, in a market economy, the value of water is set not by the total usefulness of water (infinite) or by the average usefulness of water (very large), but by the marginal value of the last drop of water consumed (very low).
Similarly, the wages and salaries of low- and high-skill workers in the robot-computer economy of the future will not be determined by the (very high) productivity of the one lower-skill worker ensuring that all of the robots are in their places or the one high-skill worker reprogramming the software. Instead, compensation will reflect what workers outside the highly productive computer-robot economy are creating and earning.
The newly industrialized city of Manchester had the highest level of labor productivity the world had ever seen. But the factory workers' wages were set not by their extraordinary productivity, but by what they would earn if they returned to the potato fields of pre-famine Ireland.
So the question is not whether robots and computers will make human labor in the goods, high-tech services, and information-producing sectors infinitely more productive. They will. What really matters is whether the jobs outside of the robot-computer economy - jobs involving people's mouths, smiles, and minds - remain valuable and in high demand.
From 1850 to 1970 or so, rapid technological progress first triggered wage increases in line with productivity gains. Then came the protracted process of income-distribution equalization, as machines, installed to substitute for human legs, and fingers created more jobs in machine-minding, which used human brains and mouths, than it destroyed in sectors requiring routine muscle power or dexterity work. And rising real incomes increased leisure time, thereby boosting demand for smiles and the products of minds.
Will the same occur when machines take over routine brainwork? Maybe. But it is far from being a safe bet on which to rest an entire argument, as Thiel has.

China�s first artificial intelligence assisted treatment center opened in Hefei, the capital of eastern China's Anhui Province on Sunday. It will carry out research to guide machine-learning, such as recognizing messages and using visual neural networks to solve problems.
The center features a voice-based information system, a computer-aided medical image diagnosis system and some other cutting-edge equipment. Studying multitudes of hospital imaging data, and two million real electronic patient cases, the system is expected to improve detection rates.
AI serves not only as a helping hand but also as a competitor for doctors. It takes a doctor about half an hour to scrutinize over 300 medical images, but through the artificial intelligence system, it only takes a few seconds.
The AI-assisted treatment simplifies the process of uploading imaging data, making a prescription, and developing new applications with technological achievements. It can ultimately be a vital solution for insufficient medical resources and could prove to be a giant step for China's medical treatment.",'% artificial intelligence%'

Private capital takes role in State giant as it embarks on mixed-ownership reform scheme
China United Network Communications Group Co Ltd, the country's second-largest mobile carrier by subscribers, has agreed to raise a total of 78 billion yuan ($11.7 billion) from strategic investors, as part of the Chinese government's push to rejuvenate State-owned enterprises with private capital.
The strategic investors include Chinese tech heavyweights Tencent Holdings, Baidu Inc, JD.com Inc, Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd, Didi Chuxing, Suning Commerce Group, as well as Chinese car rail manufacturer CRRC Corp and financial insurance enterprise China Life Insurance Co Ltd. Other tech companies such as Yongyou Software Co and Wangsu Science & Technology, and domestic industrial funds also participated in the investment.
""We are the first SOE on the group level to undertake this mixed-ownership reform scheme. It's a historic opportunity for us to introduce well-established strategic investors to explore areas of cooperation with us, in a bid to improve our management structure with diversified shareholders,"" said Wang Xiaochu, CEO of China Unicom Hong Kong.
Wang said China Unicom will cooperate with strategic investors in the areas they specialize in.
""With the domestic IT giants, we will explore cooperative opportunities in retail systems, payment systems and cloud computing. With the industry funds, we will explore business opportunities with their numerous investor companies to create a win-win result.""
Tencent, which invested 11 billion yuan, accounted for 5.18 percent of equity interests in China Unicom's Shanghai-listed arm, Baidu poured in 7 billion yuan, accounting for 3.30 percent, while Alibaba and JD invested 4.3 billion yuan and 5 billion yuan, accounting for 2.04 percent and 2.36 percent, respectively, according to China Unicom.
The company said the mixed-ownership reform proposal was approved by the country's top economic regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the share issue proposal has been approved by the board of China Unicom's listed company.
Furthermore, the Shanghai-listed arm will allot three board seats to private investors, and the mixed-ownership restructuring will be completed by the end of this year.
The investment is part of the government's drive for State behemoths to be revitalized with private capital, with China Unicom among the first batch of State-owned enterprises to see mixed-ownership reform.
""China Unicom is the biggest beneficiary of the mixed-ownership reform, as it could utilize cutting-edge technologies from internet giants, access more channels and potential customers, as well as enhance its telecom service quality through introducing new strategic investors,"" said Peter Liu, research director at consultancy Gartner Inc.
Liu added the telecom carrier will make more efforts in 4G network construction, boosting its broadband penetration rate across the country.

Based on big data technology, the machine is capable of recording the specific details of certain cultural relics. This can be used to tell fakes from originals.
The startup AITC in Yizhuang Economic and Technology Development area in the suburban Daxing district of Beijing was started in March by Hans Uszkoreit, scientific director at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence.
Uszkoreit said the center would focus on creating an AI service system and big data public technology platform. It will cooperate with companies that need the application of AI technology, such as JD.com, to make breakthrough in the fields of natural language processing and big data analysis.
Professor Uszkoreit and his company epitomize the foreign entrepreneurial rush in Beijing.
Beijing has hoped to attract more ""elite foreigners"" since it eased permanent-residence requirements in 2016. Twenty measures took effect on March 1, 2016, mainly targeting managerial-level professionals, Chinese born abroad, entrepreneurs and recently-graduated foreign students.
Zhongguancun, known in some quarters as ""China's Silicon Valley,"" has offered permanent-residence certificates in China to more than 280 foreigners since 2016.
Jahangir Raza from Pakistan just graduated from North China Electric Power University. He is working in the capital as a service manager for Beijing Aeonmed and is getting his work visa in China.
He expects a lot from his future career, and says he decided to stay in Beijing because of the great opportunities here.
Yang Zhongwei, International Marketing & Sales Director of Beijing Aeonmed, said the company would like to hire overseas staff because they can become the strong link between overseas markets and Chinese companies.
From common entrepreneurs to Nobel laureates, an increasing number of foreigners see Beijing as an ideal place for their business ideas.
THOMAS Beijing Research and Development Center was founded in Beihang University this February. The center named after Professor Thomas C. Sudhof, a winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, was jointly founded by the city of Beijing, Beihang University and Professor Thomas C. Sudhof.
Focusing on repairing central nervous system injuries, the center has a multidisciplinary advantage and undertakes research into many areas, including pathophysiology, biomaterial modification, preparation techniques and repairing neural injuries.
Nils Pihl, a tech CEO in Beijing, born in Sweden, moved to Silicon Valley and then New York, but founded a tech startup in Beijing.
He wrote an article for the Business Insider, an American news website, to explain why he chose Beijing for his startup. Pihl believes Beijing is great for innovation.
""Beijing offered us cheap housing and food, a network of experienced mentors that were happy to take the time to help, steady access to some of the world's greatest engineering talent at a sixth of the cost of a junior engineer in Silicon Valley and access to a vast market of clients,"" he wrote.
Though for Pihl it was never about costs alone.

The world�s No.1 weiqi (Go) player Ke Jie lost the contest against his artificial intelligence (AI) rival, AlphaGo, in the third and also final match of the summit on Saturday.
This match began at 10:30 BJT in Wuzhen, east China�s Zhejiang Province, with AlphaGo playing the black and Ke white.
Ke showed his brilliant weiqi skills as he said he will �fight till the end,� though he lost his previous two matches against AlphaGo on Tuesday and Thursday.
AlphaGo made the first �impolite� move as it did on Thursday � to put the black stone on the bottom-right corner of the weiqi board. It is a Chinese tradition that the first stone is usually placed around the top-right corner and this is what weiqi coaches always teach beginners.
�I think the black already wins,� said Nie Weiping, vice president of the Chinese Weiqi Association, and a Chinese weiqi legend, one hour after the match.
Just like Ke, Nie thinks AlphaGo is much stronger than any human player.
�I don�t think the match has any meaning because the huge capability gap between the two sides left no doubt who will win,� said Nie. �AlphaGo is a machine. The gap between human player and AlphaGo, for example, is like a race competition, in which we human players are like a bike or car, but AlphaGo is a plane, or even a spacecraft.�
Nie reckoned AlphaGo should be a coach for weiqi players as there is much to learn from the AI program's unusual moves in the three matches.
�I believe AlphaGo should be a coach for our professional weiqi players as a master to improve our weiqi capacity,� he said.
Although Ke fell behind fast in the beginning of the match, he fought hard to catch up with his AI opponent.
The margin became very small when the two players entered the endgame.
Ke and AlphaGo clashed hard on the last empty area on the board � the top edge.
The commentators tried very hard to guess what moves were to be made, but they were left surprised by the two sides.
During the endgame, AlphaGo chose to retreat in all places around the board, giving Ke some territory to keep the situation stable, as the machine was already confident about winning.
But Ke still chose to give up after struggling.
The match lasted over three and a half hours.",'% artificial intelligence%'
