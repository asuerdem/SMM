dailymail,17/05/2015 19:53,wires,"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — The liquid is dark red, a mixture of fat and blood, and Dr. Mark Berman pumps it out of the patient's backside. He treats it with a chemical, runs it through a processor — and injects it into the woman's aching knees and elbows.The 'soup,' he says, is rich in shape-shifting stem cells — magic bullets that, according to some doctors, can be used to treat everything from Parkinson's disease to asthma to this patient's chronic osteoarthritis.'I don't even know what's in the soup,' says Berman. 'Most of the time, if stem cells are in the soup, then the patient's got a good chance of getting better.'It's quackery, critics say. But it's also a mushrooming business — and almost wholly unregulated.The number of stem-cell clinics across the United States has surged from a handful in 2010 to more than 170 today, according to figures compiled by The Associated Press. Many of the clinics are linked in large, for-profit chains. New businesses continue to open; doctors looking to get into the field need only take a weekend seminar offered by a training company.Berman, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, is co-founder of the largest chain, the Cell Surgical Network. Like most doctors in the field, he has no formal background in stem cell research.  His company offers stem cell procedures for more than 30 diseases and conditions, including Lou Gehrig's disease, multiple sclerosis, lupus and erectile dysfunction.There are clinics that market 'anti-aging' treatments; others specialize in 'stem-cell facelifts' and other cosmetic procedures. The cost is high, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000.Berman and others point to anecdotal accounts of seemingly miraculous recoveries. But while stem cells from bone marrow have become an established therapy for a handful of blood cancers — and while there are high hopes that the cells will someday lead to other major medical advances — critics say entrepreneurs are treating patients with little or no evidence that what they do is effective.Or even safe. They point to one stem-cell doctor who has had two patients die under his care.'It's sort of this 21st century cutting-edge technology,' says Dr. Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell researcher at the University of California at Davis. 'But the way it's being implemented at these clinics and how it's regulated is more like the 19th century. It's a Wild West.'___DISCOVERING 'LIQUID GOLD'Doctors in South Korea and Japan pioneered the fat-based stem cell technique, using it to supposedly enhance face lifts and breast augmentation. For years, U.S. patients would travel to hospitals in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe — places where regulation is more lax than in the United States — to have these procedures as part of the international 'stem cell tourism' trade.Plastic surgeons in the U.S. quickly realized the financial potential of the fat they were already taking out of patients' bellies and backsides through liposuction — something that had been disposed of previously. Berman calls it 'liquid gold.'Some early adopters have expanded into chains, offering doctors across the country a chance to join the franchise after buying some equipment and attending a seminar. These doctors sometimes appear on local TV news broadcasts, drumming up new business from patients and stoking interest from other doctors.One national chain markets itself online with accounts of celebrity athletes who have been treated with its stem cell procedures. Prospective patients are then directed to a call center, where sales representatives try to match them with stem cell doctors over the phone.Berman spent over 30 years as a Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon before co-founding the Cell Surgical Network in 2012. He and his business partner, a urologist, adapted equipment and techniques from Asia into a liposuction-based procedure.Today, the Cell Surgical Network is the largest stem cell chain in the nation, with 67 locations and a roster of more than 100 doctors in 22 states. Doctors who join the network generally charge about $9,000 per procedure; they pay Berman and his partner $25,000 to $30,000 for a South Korean cell-separating machine and other equipment.Stem cells have long been recognized for their ability to reproduce and transform into other cell types. Because of their ability to repair and replace tissue, they are thought to hold potential for treating many diseases and injuries.Embryonic stem cells are the most versatile because they have the ability to form all the various cell types in the body, but their use in medicine is considered controversial by some because it involves the destruction of human embryos.Adult stem cells are less versatile, but can be easily harvested from various tissues in the body, including bone marrow and fat. For decades, they have been routinely transplanted, first in bone marrow transplants and then in procedures that transfer the cells alone. They have been useful in combatting leukemia, lymphoma and other blood diseases, saving the lives of tens of thousands of people each year.The stem cell clinics, though, promise results far beyond those currently considered prudent by mainstream medicine.'I think responsible professionals have a broad consensus that marketing of these unproven interventions is premature and unprofessional, if not unethical,' says Dr. George Daley, a founding executive of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and professor at Harvard Medical SchoolJulia Matsumoto, of Fountain Valley, Calif., claims stem cell injections have helped maintain her eyesight four years after being diagnosed with chronic relapsing neuropathy, which causes inflammation of the optic nerves and can lead to blindness.Berman has treated her on a monthly basis since 2012, free of charge, because Matsumoto cannot afford repeat procedures. Berman liposuctions fat from her abdomen then processes it with a spinning centrifuge machine and a drug, before filtering it and infusing the mixture into an injection site in Matsumoto's chest.'Things were so vivid and bright literally 30 minutes after the stem cells were given to me,' Matsumoto says, recalling her first treatment. 'I started crying on the way home.'Such patient anecdotes are not considered reliable medical evidence. And because stem cell clinics have not published large, rigorous studies of their techniques, it's virtually impossible to evaluate their record of success.Berman calls his business model 'patient-funded research,' and says he plans to soon publish the results of a 1,000-patient study demonstrating its safety. Cell Surgical has hired consultants to follow up with patients over the phone and survey how they are feeling.But Leigh Turner, a professor of bioethics at the University of Minnesota, says charging patients to participate in medical research is bizarre and unethical. He calls the approach 'unauthorized, for-profit human experimentation,' and has asked the Food and Drug Administration to investigate Berman, arguing that his business amounts to selling unapproved, experimental drugs.Some practitioners point to early-stage laboratory and animal studies which have been published in scientific journals. But academics say such findings cannot be applied to humans and don't provide critical information about potential side effects like infections, tumors and blood clots.'This field, sadly, is contaminated by lots of poor-quality data that people are using to move forward and actually treat patients,' says Daley, of Harvard Medical School.___THE RISKSThe clinics insist that their treatments are safe, but routinely require that patients sign waivers.Cell Surgical's patients sign an informed consent form acknowledging that they are participating in an experimental study. The form states that there is no guarantee that the stem cell treatment will work, and lists potential risks. It also makes clear that patients are responsible for paying the full cost of the procedure, which is not covered by insurance.Patients of Dr. Zannos Grekos, a cardiologist in Bonita Springs, Florida, who specialized in using stem cells to treat debilitating diseases, also were required to sign a consent form, acknowledging the procedures' risks, including death.But families of at least two of Grekos' patients say he downplayed the risks. Gina Adams, daughter of patient Richard Poling, says her family was told her father would be 'back on the golf course the next day' after a routine procedure he hoped would help him recover from a lung condition that made breathing difficult. The cost was $8,000.The family was told that the stem cells would regenerate Poling's lung cells.In March 2012, Grekos harvested fat from Poling's abdomen and sent it to an off-site processing facility to isolate the stem cells. Later that afternoon, he directed an assistant to infuse the resulting mixture into the patient's bloodstream.Poling suffered cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead after being rushed to a local hospital.An investigation by the Florida Department of Health concluded the procedure had 'no substantiated medical or scientific value.'Two years earlier, in 2010, 69-year old Domenica Fitzgerald suffered a stroke after Grekos infused unfiltered bone marrow-derived stem cells into the arteries of her brain. The state report concluded 'it was virtually inevitable that the procedure would clog blood vessels in the brain and cause a major and very possibly fatal stroke.' Fitzgerald suffered severe brain damage and was later removed from life support.Jack Fitzgerald says his wife, who used a wheel chair, had hoped that stem cells might help her walk again in time for her grandson's college graduation. She had previously suffered nerve damage as a side effect of chemotherapy used to treat breast cancer.'When they're desperate, people try things,' Fitzgerald says. 'When you're really ill you'll say, 'Let me give it a shot and see if it can help me.''After Domenica Fitzgerald's death, the state ordered Grekos to stop using stem cells in his practice, but he did not. Not until 2013, after Poling's death, did the Florida Medical Board unanimously vote to revoke the doctor's license.'It was proved overwhelmingly that the procedures he used did not meet the standard of care,' says Natalie Spindle, spokeswoman for the Department of Health.Fitzgerald and his family brought a wrongful death lawsuit against Grekos, which was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. The Poling family considered suing Grekos, but their lawyer advised that little money was left to recover.Both families had hoped the Florida state attorney general would bring criminal charges against Grekos. But last May, state prosecutors declined to move forward with the case.Though barred from practicing medicine in Florida, Grekos continues to treat patients in the Dominican Republican through his company Regenocyte, which promotes treatments for autism, dementia, cystic fibrosis and many other diseases.He believes the two patients' deaths were unrelated to his care — the state targeted him to discourage other doctors from working with stem cells, he says.___MURKY REGULATIONThe regulators tasked with weeding out dangerous medical practices are the 50 state medical boards responsible for licensing and disciplining health professionals. But those groups have taken action against only a handful of stem cell doctors.Last year, the Oregon Medical Board revoked the license of Dr. Kenneth Welker, a Eugene physician who performed at least five experimental stem cell procedures. In one case, a 62-year-old woman who received a spinal injection of stem cells experienced tingling, elevated blood pressure and rapid breathing, according to the board's complaint. The group fined Welker $10,000 and revoked his license, citing 'unprofessional or dishonorable conduct.'State sanctions against stem cell doctors are rare because medical boards generally begin investigating practitioners only after patients have been harmed. That's led many industry critics to conclude that regulation must come from the FDA, which regulates experimental drugs and medical products on a national level.But the FDA's authority to regulate stem cell procedures is not clearly defined and has been debated by legal experts for years. In that time, the agency has cracked down only on a handful of clinics, which industry observers say has emboldened stem cell entrepreneurs.Lee Buckler, a stem cell consultant for drug and device makers, says many doctors 'believe that there is no problem with what they're doing because the FDA hasn't knocked on their door.'The key issue in FDA's oversight of cell-based medicines turns on how much processing the stem cells undergo. According to FDA regulations, human cells that are more than 'minimally manipulated' are subject to the same regulations as prescription drugs. But 'minimal manipulation' is not clearly defined in FDA guidelines.When the FDA has shut down stem cell clinics, it has usually been for growing stem cells in the laboratory for weeks at a time. In at least two cases, the FDA said that that approach exceeds the 'minimal manipulation' threshold and could endanger patients due to potential contamination and infection.But the FDA appeared less interested in policing the far more common practice of same-day stem cell procedures, in which cells are extracted and returned to patients in a few hours.Now, the FDA appears to be stepping up its oversight. In the last days of 2014, it released draft guidelines dealing with these procedures. The agency said that processing fat into stem cells for medical use is more than 'minimal manipulation,' essentially creating a new drug, which cannot be sold in the U.S. without the agency's approval.The guidelines have not been finalized — a process that can take years. And the agency said in a statement that it hopes doctors will use the proposed rules to essentially police themselves 'and reduce the need for enforcement actions.'The FDA declined to make officials available for an on-the-record interview for this story. But in a statement, it said it 'takes violations of the regulations seriously and routinely follows up on entities producing products that potentially violate FDA regulations.'Many stem cell doctors continue to argue that they don't need FDA permission because they are not creating drugs, but performing in-office surgical procedures, which are not regulated by the agency.But Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at University of Wisconsin, says the FDA's draft guidelines make clear that processed fat stem cells meet the same definition as prescription drugs. 'You cannot sell that in the United States without it having been approved,' says Charo, who spent two years at the FDA as a policy adviser.Getting a drug approved by the FDA requires extensive clinical testing. And if stem cell doctors followed the FDA's requirements, they would not be able to begin testing their techniques on patients until completing a rigorous FDA application process, which can take years and cost millions of dollars. Patients would then be carefully tracked through large clinical trials, measured against a control group of patients receiving a sham treatment or a traditional therapy.Academic researchers are slowly moving ahead with hundreds of their own, more traditional studies. Researchers at the University of Florida, Duke University and six other universities are studying fat-derived stem cells as a treatment for heart disease. The trial is sponsored by Cytori Therapeutics, a company that makes a fat-processing stem cell device.Elsewhere, doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota are investigating stem cells for Lou Gehrig's Disease. And Baylor College of Medicine in Texas plans to begin enrolling patients for a study using stem cells to treat erectile dysfunction.In the meantime, doctors who perform stem cell procedures continue to practice what they see as transformative medicine.For now, Berman says he has no plans to change his business because he is helping people.'How is it unethical if you're actually helping people, even if we don't have evidence-based studies to prove it?' he says.He adds:  'If I'm breaking the law, how come I haven't been arrested yet?'"
telegraph,29/06/2005 00:01,technology,"            Cell therapy has been touted as the future of medicine but, finds Roger Highfield, doctors are uneasy about the media hype                  They offer the solution for every human woe. The infertile can use them to grow eggs and sperm. Dementia, heart disease, blindness, Parkinson's, damaged arteries - you name it - can also be fixed with the help of stem cells. We can all wave goodbye to the outdated idea of repairing a body, because we can now regenerate one. With stem cells, doctors really can rebuild you. In the past few days, however, some prominent figures have voiced their unease about how stem cell research is being oversold.           While many scientists sincerely believe that huge strides will come in the long term from research into stem cells, the parents of all 200 or more types in the body, they fear a backlash will result when the research fails to live up to unrealistic expectations in the short term.          Over the decades the mismatch between the daily agenda of the media and the glacial pace of research has set a familiar pattern, where the media turn tentative findings into headline news and, with equal glee, seize on the inevitable disappointments and failures that follow.          Monoclonal antibodies, proteins with the ability to bind to a specific molecular target, were hailed as a way to revolutionise the treatment of disease. Their ability to find one molecule in a haystack of zillions has been a boon for research and diagnosis and is now being used in some treatments. However, three decades after a way to make them in the lab was developed, they are far from the 'magic bullet' once portrayed by the media.          Gene therapy was trumpeted as a potential treatment for 4,000 inherited diseases and a vast range of ailments with a genetic component, from cancer to heart disease. But little progress has been made since the first clinical trial began in 1990. In 1999, gene therapy suffered a major setback with the death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger, as the virus used for gene transfer triggered a severe immune response. The field then received a major boost when a French gene therapy trial showed real promise but was tarnished again when one of the boys taking part died.          Now stem cells make headlines almost every day. Last week, researchers in Baltimore found that human embryonic stem cells could be made to develop spontaneously into blood cells, a team in Florida grew them into brain cells, and scientists from North Carolina said they had successfully isolated stem cells from human skin and coaxed them into becoming fat, muscle and bone cells.          The most coverage was generated by Prof Harry Moore's team at Sheffield University which told a European fertility conference how it had shown embryonic stem cells - removed when the embryo is the size of the tip of a pin - could develop into the earliest stages of eggs and sperm, raising the prospect that it may be possible to clone stem cells from an infertile patient and turn these into the required sperm or eggs for IVF.          Behrouz Aflatoonian, a PhD student in Prof Moore's lab, was at pains to emphasise that there was still much work to be done before the promise of his early results could be translated into reality. Prof Moore himself said that it is difficult at a conference to get the balance right between keeping peers up to date with progress, engaging with the public and not over hyping findings. 'We can't win. We are criticised if we don't explain our work to the public, but, if we do, the press usually go overboard.'          In his Gresham Special Lecture, delivered last week in the Great Hall, Guildhall, the fertility expert Lord Winston said the announcement by the Sheffield team 'in reality is pretty trivial' and added: 'There is a real risk with stem cells that we are raising expectations that they will be much more successful than they are likely to be.'          Lord Winston said: 'Whilst I am certainly not against stem cell technology, and indeed believe it is a vital and exciting area, we need to be cautious about how to explain this to the public. I am not arguing that it should not be funded, it is just that we must not make exaggerated claims. In the long term they will come to haunt us.'          While some stem cell work, notably the use of bone marrow transplants (which contain adult stem cells), is routine, the use of embryonic stem cells is, well, embryonic. In the short term, they offer most potential as a means to study the cause of disease and to test drugs, not to treat disease. 'Far from being a great success story, the use of embryonic stem cells probably is pretty limited and are likely to remain very limited for the time being for a number of very good scientific reasons,' said Lord Winston.          One issue, he said, is that 'the idea of growing someone's own stem cells in the laboratory for their own treatment is probably impractical. And if you try to force their growth, you may force anomalies which might be genetic or chromosomal. That should be a concern.'          A second issue is how to turn embryonic stem cells into the desired type. Before they can be used for repair, researchers must find ways - without the help of animal products - to do this efficiently, stably and in sufficient numbers.          There is a theoretical risk posed by even a single embryonic stem cell among, for example, the nerve cells derived from embryo cells for transplant into a Parkinson's disease patient. The cell could turn into the wrong type of tissue or multiply to form a cancer consisting of a wide range of cell types called a teratoma, or a malignant tumour.          'There are a lot of reasons to be very cautious about putting these cells back into people,' said Lord Winston. 'If you decide that you need to treat a heart infarct with 10 million cells, how are you going to guarantee that your population is absolutely pure and stable? You only need a few rogue cells to initiate a problem.'          Dr Robin Lovell-Badge of the National Institute of Medical Research, Mill Hill, agrees with this caution but pointed out that, so far at least, this fear has not been realised. Prof Hans Keirstead and his colleagues in the University of California, Irvine, for example, have shown how they can obtain from human embryonic stem cells almost pure populations of the specialised cell type that insulates nerves (oligodendrocytes).          Injections of these cells improves mobility in rats with spinal cord injuries, providing evidence that these cells can help restore motor skills lost from acute spinal cord tissue damage, and without the cancer problem.          Another issue concerns the use of cloning to derive a patient's own embryonic stem cells. Stem cell lines produced from patients with hereditary diseases are likely to display characteristics of the disease, so probably they will not be appropriate for direct use in treating the patients. In theory, at least, there are ways round this, such as genetic modification.          One alternative is to make a withdrawal from the UK's stem cell bank in South Mimms - use embryonic stem cells derived from a normal patient with a good tissue match. But the use of banked cells raises other problems.          A recent article in the British Medical Journal pointed out that the expansion of stem cell cultures could allow a single stem cell line to be used for hundreds, if not thousands of patients, increasing the potential risk of disease transmission from a single infected donor. As emphasised by the example of the HIV spread to haemophiliacs and BSE to people, stem cell therapy could put patients at risk of viral or prion diseases unless appropriate safety systems are in place.          There are also more subtle problems. Teams in South Korea, Edinburgh and Newcastle are attempting to isolate stem cells from embryos that have been cloned from a body cell. But the process used to do this, called 'nuclear transfer', can cause 'epigenetic problems', where epigenetics refers to the ways that genes are used in the body rather than changes in the genes themselves.          Although every cell in the body has the same genes, each cell 'plays' a different repertoire, depending on whether it is an eye cell or a brain cell and whether the gene is imprinted, which means that only the paternal or the maternal copy of a particular gene is used.          Imprinting is thought to govern the use of some genes, mostly those concerned with the growth of the placenta. When it goes awry, the effects can be serious. One crucial imprinted gene is a growth inhibitor called IGF2R (the gene makes a receptor that mops up a paternal growth signal, called IGF2, from the circulation). If imprinting is disrupted, there may be overgrowth disorders, such as one called Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome.          Recently, scientists from the United States, Sweden and Japan showed how an 'epigenetic' problem improperly turns on the copy of the IGF2 gene that should remain off, doubling the risk that a cancer-causing genetic mutation will trigger a tumour. In other words, imprinting must be stable in stem cells if they are to be used in treatments. Fortunately, a study by Prof Roger Pedersen of Cambridge University has concluded that imprinting is 'remarkably stable' by studying six imprinted genes, part of a more systematic study.          'This work is important, since it addresses one of the worries,' said Dr Lovell-Badge. 'This is not only surprising but good news.'          'I could not sleep at night if I had not done this study,' added Prof Pedersen. 'Now we can go ahead with a clear conscience and develop them for therapeutic use.'          However, imprinting affects at least 75 genes, perhaps as many as 1,000, and Prof Pedersen's study is silent on the stability of cloned embryonic stem cells, so the work does not give total reassurance.          Meanwhile, the pro life movement has pointed to evidence that adult stem cells, such as those from bone marrow, can 'transdifferentiate' and be turned into nerve, heart muscle and other cell types for repair, and make the use of embryonic stem cells redundant.           But Prof Austin Smith of Edinburgh University's Institute of Stem Cell Research, said that although he supports studies of adult stem cells, the claims that they could transdifferentiate, notably from bone marrow to heart cells, were unfounded. The stem cell community regards these claims as 'embarrassing.'          The message remains that stem cell science has vast potential to do good. And it is well worth boosting the level of government investment, which is currently under consideration by the UK Stem Cell Initiative. But although some adult cell applications are close, the use of embryonic stem cell treatments by doctors is a long way from being routine."
telegraph,1/12/2004 0:01,education,"            Britain leads the way in stem-cell research... but, if we do not act now, the benefits of our work could be lost abroad. Roger Highfield reports                  Time and again in the history of British science, we make a big breakthrough and push back the frontiers of science, only to lose out to those with more chutzpah, vision and money.           That is what happened with MRI and CAT body scanners. That is what happened in the case of the liquid crystal display. That is also what happened with penicillin, the first antibiotic, a British discovery that ended up being developed in America.          When monoclonal antibodies were discovered in Cambridge, the National Research Development Corporation, then charged with 'picking winners', made the deathless judgment that 'it is difficult for us to identify any immediate practical application'. This impractical idea has since generated billions of pounds of revenue.          Now it looks as though British ingenuity is going to be exploited abroad again when it comes to the most promising - and controversial - development in medical science: treatments based on stem cells, 'parents' of all 200 different types in the body, from nerve to heart to skin cells.          Scientists worldwide are studying these cells, notably those isolated from early embryos, because they offer a way to turn back the biological clock. Current drugs can do no more than slow the progress of degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Stem cells may one day replace cells and rebuild tissues, perhaps even organs, helping to restore patients to the way they were before succumbing to blindness, heart disease and a host of other ailments.           Britain has led the way. While working in Cambridge, Sir Martin Evans pioneered stem-cell science in studies of mice, and Prof Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh showed how cloning could be used to turn adult cells into the most versatile stem cells of all - embryonic stem cells. Britain has also set up the world's first bank for stem cells.           Two years ago, the Government committed £40 million to fund early research over three years. Last month, the Prime Minister declared that the Government wanted to make Britain the 'science capital of the world'. He talked of how stem-cell research had the potential to 'revolutionise medical research'. Britain could 'lead the world' in this field: 'We should have the confidence to grasp the opportunities.'          But there is one problem that governments have endlessly wrestled with but never fixed. Britain is less entrepreneurial than America and less willing to take risks. British businesses have a 'can't do' attitude and are fearful of failure. Britain is starved of risk-taking entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and investors.           Research councils fund early science, not applications. Pharmaceutical companies see the commercial applications as too distant to commit shareholders' funds. Venture capital is non-existent. Stem-cell scientists are forced to grub around for funds from rich widows, philanthropists, universities – anyone to fill the funding gap between bright ideas and treatments. And the window of opportunity for Britain to fill this gap 'is closing fast', says Sir Chris Evans, chairman of Merlin Biosciences, one of our largest medical venture-capital players. He fears Britain is once again going to 'let all its hard work go abroad'.           British stem-cell companies are already looking to America to fund the next stage of their work. 'They will probably end up being invested in, controlled or bought by an American company,' said Sir Chris. Some leading medical researchers and surgeons are already dependent on funding for grants and consultancies from America, so they can't offer their services to British teams.           Rather than see history repeat itself, Sir Chris and a range of influential figures have proposed the establishment of an independent medical foundation to bridge the funding chasm. This public-private partnership would have to be the biggest of its kind: to develop a cell therapy for a single disease - showing it is safe and works - will cost well over £20 million. Sir Chris believes we should already be developing between 10 and 20 new treatments, given Britain's expertise, which means £400 million in all.           He desires no personal commercial involvement with the foundation, but has agreed to be a trustee to get the initiative off the ground, as he has done before with countless biotech ventures. Heavyweight figures have lined up to join him as trustees: fertility expert and television presenter Lord Winston, Dr Ian Gibson, chairman of the Commons committee on science and technology, Jon Moulton of Alchemy Partners, one of Britain's leading venture capitalists, and Sir Richard Sykes, chairman of the Biosciences Leadership Council and rector of Imperial College.          The trustees want the foundation to be a national institution run by professionals, accountable to the great and good who have a passionate belief in the future benefits of human stem cells. To get this initiative going, it has to be backed by more than a little seed funding from the Government.           For the £25 million the Government spent on the inspirational - though ultimately failed - Beagle 2 Mars lander and for a fraction of the cost of the Millennium Dome, the Treasury could easily help the foundation reach its initial target of £100 million.          Philanthropists would be another source, along with the Wellcome Trust, the biomedical research charity. The lottery could also be asked to set up an endowment to cover running costs. And the foundation could be entitled to a small percentage of future royalty rights to arise from successful cell therapies to keep it going over the long term. The effort would be run by experienced management and proposals would be vetted by a committee comprising Britain's leading stem-cell researchers and clinicians.           The initiative could unite disparate networks of British stem-cell researchers, helping them cross-fertilise ideas and technologies. This could help the country make the most of efforts under way at the Roslin Institute, the University of Sheffield, Imperial, King's, Newcastle and elsewhere. In turn, their efforts could be co-ordinated with those of British companies such as ReNeuron and Intercytex.          Sir Chris emphasised that the foundation would place special emphasis on ethical issues. There are fears that efforts to clone embryos for stem cells will make it easier to clone babies, which is outlawed. And pro-life campaigners oppose the destruction of early embryos consisting of 100 cells, arguing that these insensate blobs deserve the same rights as people.           The pro-life movement lost this argument after a long debate in Parliament, which balanced these fears with the vast potential of cell therapies - not just in treatments but in replacing animals tests with those on human cells. Britain now has the most liberal laws in the world, allowing - after careful scrutiny - the creation of cloned human embryos for the production of stem cells.           Among the nation's stem-cell scientists, one significant backer of the foundation is Professor Roger Pedersen, head of the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute. It was a pivotal moment when Prof Pedersen, a friend of the late Christopher Reeve, moved in 2001 from the University of California in San Francisco to Cambridge. In America, it symbolised the threat of a brain drain of stem-cell scientists to more liberal political climates. In Britain, it showed that stem-cell research was a field in which American dominance could be challenged. 'One of the issues that is critical is to provide continuity of funding,' said Prof Pedersen. 'Having placed its flag on the continent of new knowledge about stem cells, will the UK now defend that position?'           Although the Bush Administration is against human embryonic stem-cell research, spending just $25 million on the field last year and campaigning for a ban in the United Nations, America is girding its loins for a huge effort. California has 'Proposition 71', a state initiative to give $3 billion to stem-cell research. Fearing Californian domination of the field, other states, notably New Jersey, have plans for new funding for stem-cell research. Harvard University wants to build a $100 million stem-cell research institute. Venture capitalists are likely to ride on the coat tails of these initiatives, pouring in more funding.          Sceptics point out the failure of President Nixon's 'war against cancer' in 1971 and how the molecular understanding of cancer has started to pay off only in the past few years. Encouragingly, however, cell-based treatments are already in use: bone-marrow grafts are the best-known examples, but others include the use of islet cells to treat diabetes and bone and cartilage cell grafts to help rebuild bones and joints. Using embryonic, foetal and adult stem cells, the possibilities can be expanded hugely.          Even though the promise is long term, and even though the American effort lacks government endorsement, the short-term impact of the American efforts on British science could be profound. California's $300 million a year for stem-cell research for the next decade promises to shift the global centre of gravity of stem-cell research, triggering a drain of talent from Britain.          Meanwhile, China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Israel and Australia are also pouring money into the field. South Korea also holds the distinction of having the first team to isolate human cloned embryonic stem cells.           When it comes to rising to this challenge, the British Government appears receptive. Chancellor Gordon Brown said in June that 'we propose to take the longer-term view and to choose innovation, science and technology'. There are many leading figures who believe that tomorrow's pre-Budget speech offers a chance for Mr Brown to put his money where his mouth is.           'We have the maximum of a year to get this right,' said Sir Chris. 'Britain faces a stark choice. It would be a tragedy if the country were not to see the enormous human benefit and economic returns of its early investment in stem-cell science.'           Will the foundation become ensnared in red tape, bogged down in political squabbling or die of ministerial apathy? Given the backing of the likes of Evans, Moulton and Winston, this is one demand for action that the Government will find hard to ignore. 'If this doesn't work, nothing will,' said Sir Chris.         How stem cells can fix...                     Eyes British scientists have carried out the first stem cell transplant to improve vision in eyes damaged by retinal disease, laying the foundation of new treatments for blindness.          An Anglo-American team has shown for the first time that adult stem cells can be used to replace dead cells in the retina, reversing the damage caused by retinitis pigmentosa, the world's leading cause of inherited blindness.           The study, published in Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science, reversed retinitis pigmentosa in mice, so they could see again, and the team believes that stem cell transplants will be performed on blind patients within a decade.          The team included Prof Pete Coffey of Sheffield University, now at the Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London, who said: 'We hope that this research will lead to a number of stem cell therapies for treating blindness.' But he added: 'It is very difficult to get venture capital money for cell therapies, period.'                      Ears Treatments for deafness based on the ability to grow new cells in the inner ear are being studied at Sheffield University. Dr Marcelo Rivolta of the Centre for Stem Cell Biology is investigating human embryonic stem cells and foetal cells. His research so far has shown that by using cocktails of chemicals known as 'growth factors', human stem cells can be manipulated to obtain cells that could be transplanted into a damaged part of the ear, a process which could restore hearing.           Dr Rivolta said they were still at the 'very early stages' of their research. 'It is a very challenging approach but we are confident it is possible and the potential for these cells is there,' Dr Rivolta told a recent meeting of the RNID. 'We hope to do the first tests in animals in the next two years,' he said.                       Livers Stem cell therapy is being readied to help patients with chronic liver failure by a team from Imperial College London and Hammersmith hospital. In patients with chronic liver failure, the liver has lost cells, reducing its effectiveness. By injecting the patient's own stem cells, or blood derived stem cells, directly into the bloodstream, the researchers hope they may be able to improve the function of the liver. The trial is being funded by Hammersmith Hospital NHS Trust. Prof Nagy Habib, who is now assessing patients for his trial, said raising funding is 'absolute murder'.                      Brains Preliminary trials of stem cells on small numbers of patients who have suffered long term disabilities because of a stroke are planned by the start of 2006.          A way to mass produce human foetal nerve stem cells in the laboratory has been developed by Dr John Sinden's Guildford-based company, ReNeuron. One such cell line, called ReN001, was tested in rats to treat stroke, with encouraging results. The foundation will come too late for ReNeuron's stroke trials but, when it comes to raising funding, 'so far so good,' said Dr Sinden. It is 'quite a struggle,' he added. California's $300 million a year for stem cell research for the next decade - the same as spenton the worldwide effort to crack the human genetic code - promises to shift in the global centre of gravity of stem cell research, triggering a drain of talent from the UK.          Meanwhile, China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Israel and Australia are also pouring money into the field. South Korea also holds the distinction of having the first team to isolate human cloned embryonic stem cells.           When it comes to rising to thischallenge, the UK Government appears receptive.

'If this doesn't work then nothing will,' said Sir Chris.         Fighting the corner for Britain                     Lord Winston, IVF pioneer and broadcaster'We are lagging behind, around the level of Israel, which is pretty pathetic. This is a really good initiative. It is very ambitious but we still have the science base which could do a good job in this area.'                      Prof Trevor Jones, chairman of ReNeuron, until recently, director general of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry'Britain has led the world in its appropriate use of stem-cell science. We need to see that maintained. When America eventually gets its act together, we don't want to see it all drain away.'                      Jon Moulton, of Alchemy Partners, a leading venture capitalistWants to see 'a serious, substantial commitment to developing stem cells in the UK. The potential of stem cells to do good for humanity is very large. And it would be really nice to see British science prospering in that area.'                      Sir Richard Sykes, Rector of Imperial College'We become pioneers and then the whole bloody thing fades into the past because we never fund research properly. This happened in the early days of biotechnology and it is going to happen here. We are not going to get anywhere unless we get some funding.'                      Dr Simon Best, steering group, Scottish Stem Cell Network'Britain has done a great deal to position itself at the forefront of this technology. The Foundation is the best way to keep Britain at the forefront.'"
telegraph,28/06/2007 00:01,news,"            Roger Highfield describes a fundamental advance in stem cell science                   A 'missing link' stem cell has been found by two British teams that will shave years off the efforts to turn flexible cells into new treatments for a vast range of ailments, such as diabetes and cystic fibrosis.          Around the world a race has been on to take stem cells, notably those isolated from the early embryo, and then turn them into nerve, muscle and more than 200 other cell types, even tissues, to repair a damaged body or treat disease.           The field has been hindered by how different the stem cells that can be isolated from surplus human IVF embryos are to those first isolated from mouse embryos a quarter of a century ago by another pioneering British team. Both the human and the mouse stem cells were 'pluripotent' which meant they could turn into any type of cells: nerve cells, blood cells, among others, but not eggs and sperm.           But the human embryonic stem cells looked different from those isolated from human embryos and had to be grown in different ways from the mouse ones. Consequently, the efforts to transfer previous mouse findings to human studies had met with limited success.           Now two independent teams of researchers based at Cambridge University and Oxford University have discovered a further type of embryonic stem cell in mice and rats which is strikingly similar to human embryonic stem cells.           'This new type of stem cells provides the missing link between mouse and human embryonic stem cells,' said Prof Roger Pedersen whose Medical Research Council funded laboratory led the Cambridge team. 'Finding a type of mouse stem that so closely resembles the human stem cells will accelerate the delivery of health benefits from stem cell research.'           When asked how far away the first clinical applications might be, he said: 'I think we're talking five years. Those would be very early studies that involve a human individual. I think we can envisage larger scale clinical trials occurring within a decade.'           Sir Richard Gardner, head of the Oxford team, added, 'Having both studies reach the same conclusions at the same time allows other researchers to use this new information immediately.'           Both papers are published today in Nature and will accelerate efforts to find embryo-free ways to make stem cells, so researchers will not have to rely exclusively on surplus human embryos from In-Vitro Fertilisation clinics, which are in short supply.           The discovery, and its virtually simultaneous verification, will in the short term help the derivation of stem cells from a wide range of new species - including livestock and disease-prone mice used in research - thereby providing better models for researchers involved in stem cell research.           'Mice do not provide very good models of lung disease such as cystic fibrosis,' said Sir Richard. But today's work suggests it should be easier to isolate embryonic stem cells from pigs and sheep, which offer much better models of several human diseases, but had not previously yielded such cells by older methods.           Similarly, the new stem cells should make it possible to carry out genetic studies on a type of mouse that develops diabetes similar to that suffered by people. 'Because of the close similarity of these newly-discovered stem cells to human embryonic stem cells, we can now do a whole range of experiments in the mouse that are directly relevant to the human,' said Prof Pedersen.           The newly found stem cells, known as 'epiblast stem cells' were found by dissecting mouse embryo cells from the innermost cell layer (epiblast) of the one week old rodent embryo, just before more specialised tissues develop.           This method contrasts with previous studies, which started with the early blastocyst stage, the stage of the embryo around four days after conception. 'These findings suggest that human embryonic stem cells also originate at a later stage of development than previously thought,' said Sir Richard. 'Pinpointing the developmental stage when human embryonic stem cells originate will help scientists who are using stem cells to develop cures for injuries and disease,'           The new stem cells taken from this later stage of development could be maintained using the same growth factors as those used in the culture of human embryonic stem cells and looked very similar to the human cells. Scientists discouraged by failures to isolate embryonic stem cells in other mammals, using the older methods and starting with blastocysts, will now be encouraged to find pluripotent stem cells in domestic or endangered species.           Prof Pedersen's group managed to isolate rat embryonic stem cells for the first time, based on this new understanding. However, the only creature shown to have embryonic stem cells able to make sperm and eggs as well as all other cell type, remains the mouse.           The new stem cells 'will teach us about how human embryonic stem cells generate the hundreds of cell types that make up the human body - knowledge that will help us realize the promise of stem cell therapy,' said the director of the US National Institutes of Health, Elias Zerhouni."
telegraph,25/07/2006 00:01,technology,"            If the ageing of cells can be stopped, we might have found the way to stop getting older, says Roger Highfield                   Within each and every one of your trillions of cells sits a molecular hour-glass. The time when each and every cell must stop dividing comes closer with every grain of sand that drops through this tiny clock.          The grains are letters of DNA code that fall off these cellular timepieces. Scientists call them telomeres and there is good evidence that they go wrong in cancer so that, by fixing them, tumours could be made to expire on schedule. Earlier this month, a team in California managed to inhibit the spread of melanoma skin cancer by exploiting this mechanism.          Others believe that telomeres may hold the key to ageing itself. A team at Brown University in Rhode Island recently reported that cells with faulty telomeres made up about four per cent of connective tissue in five-year-old baboons. But in 30-year-olds, that number rose as high as 20 per cent, providing evidence to support the theory that old cells help make old bodies.          When telomeres run out, cells become 'senescent'. Under a microscope, they look bloated. Analyse the way that they use genes and one can see changes that make the senescent cells secrete factors that make tissues deteriorate. Because they hang around for years, rather than do something helpful like die, these old cells may well underpin age-related disease.          Perhaps a way to turn back telomeres can be found, marking the culmination of the search for the elixir of youth, although there is still a great deal of argument about whether it is ageing that shortens telomeres or whether stubby telomeres cause ageing.          These remarkable timepieces are found in cells at the tip of chromosomes, the packages of DNA at the heart of our cells. They, too, are made of DNA and consist of a genetic stutter or repetition where the same 'letters' of genetic code are repeated over and over.          There are only four letters of genetic code - C, G, A and T - and each telomere consists of a little 'word', TTAGGG, that is written up to 2,000 times, making about 12,000 letters of code in all. The actual number of letters depends on the tissue you are looking at - telomeres are longer in brain cells because they do not divide so often.          These telomeres are not themselves genes, the sections of DNA that tell the body how to make proteins, but seem to be like the plastic bits at the end of shoelaces: telomeres stop chromosomes from 'fraying'.          But telomeres themselves randomly shorten with repeated cell divisions, an average of 80 letters each go. When they have dwindled to a certain point, the cell can no longer divide. Until recently, this crucial cut-off point that signalled senescence was elusive. Scientists had measured it by designing a probe to cling to TTAGGG, reasoning that the more probe that stuck, the longer the telomere. But when the telomeres are short enough to cause problems, this ruler becomes unreliable.          An accurate method to study what telomeres are telling us, particularly when cellular time is short, has been developed by Dr Duncan Baird of Cardiff University, who has adapted methods to study single DNA molecules pioneered by Sir Alec Jeffreys of Leicester University, the father of the field of genetic fingerprinting.          Called Stela (single telomere length analysis), it amplifies the trace quantities of telomere with PCR, a standard method to multiply any DNA that sits on any section of a chromosome staked out by two molecular probes. The tricky part came in marking out the telomere. Although there are ways to identify where it starts, it was not obvious where each one ended.          Dr Baird had a brainwave, realising that the end of the telomere has an overhang where DNA's double helix becomes a single strand. By designing probes that could stick to this loose end, he found an accurate way to measure the relentless tick of the telomere.          This is the only way sensitive enough to tell when a cell's time is up. The method has been patented and has already shown its worth by producing some important insights. For example, it had been thought that telomeres had to shorten to 4,000 to 6,000 letters for problems to occur. 'It turns out that telomeres are only a few hundred letters long at the point of senescence,' says Dr Baird.          This mechanism probably evolved as a way to prevent cancers from occurring in long-lived species by setting an upper limit to the number of times cells can divide and so make it harder for the uncontrolled cell division found in tumours. Thus short-lived mice have huge telomeres, when we have long ones.          This protection only goes so far. When telomeres in a cell finally wear away, then, on dividing, chromosomes can stick to another, causing the kind of disruption that can pave the way to cancer. This is why Cancer Research UK funds Dr Baird's work, which was recognised a few days ago with an Entente Cordiale Cancer Prize in Paris.          His work with Stela has revealed wide differences in telomere length among people, from 8,000 to almost 18,000. 'That is a surprisingly large variation,' he says. 'Whether that will affect overall ageing will take years to work out.' We inherit different lengths from our parents, suggesting we may be born with different lengths and, thus, we may enter the world with different cellular ages.          The length of the telomeres can also vary among the 46 chromosomes in a single cell, even between the supposedly identical chromosomes in a pair. But whether the ageing of one chromosome is more important than others is still not known. For example, chromosome 17 may be more vulnerable to being shorter because it contains p53, a gene that plays a critical role in cancers. Perhaps this chromosome holds the critical measure of cellular age.          Telomeres may even reveal why men tend to die younger than women. In May, a study published in the journal Cytogenetic and Genome Research showed significantly shorter telomeres and higher erosion rates in men than in women, which likely causes a shorter life expectancy of male cells and tissues.          The good news is that an enzyme called telomerase lengthens chromosomes by adding TTAGGG sequences. But here is the bad news. Although a handful of human cells - germ cells and embryonic stem cells - use telomerase to circumvent that shortening process and thus the ageing process, and achieve a cellular version of immortality, normal cells do not produce the enzyme.          Because most cells do not regularly produce and use telomerase, they age and, thus, we age, too (if, of course, you accept that they cause ageing, rather than are a sign of ageing).          Finding a way to boost telomerase in cells could also be harmful. Telomerase is activated in 90 per cent of all cancers, in which cells continue to divide at a high and uncontrolled rate. Instead, it may be better to use drugs to produce a transient boost in telomerase activity and thus prevent telomeres becoming critically short.          Such a discovery might lengthen life, but do so without tipping into the cancer zone. The corollary of this effort is to develop safe ways to attack the telomerase that cancer cells produce. Anti-telomerase medications, if developed, may cure early cancers.          At the University of Glasgow, Dr Nicol Keith is looking at one way to do this. He is studying a molecular switch, the promoter, that turns telomerase on and off.          This could offer all sorts of opportunities. Researchers are also seeking ways to preserve telomeres without involving telomerase at all. A group at Stanford University in California has succeeded in making DNA sequences they call 'nanocircles' that can add long sequences of TTAGGG to the tips of chromosomes.          One day, it may indeed be possible to wind back the cellular clock."
telegraph,20/11/2007 15:30,news,"            Two milestone studies reveal why therapeutic cloning has no future, reports Roger Highfield                  Landmark research published today by scientists in America and Japan is likely to render plans to clone human embryos redundant in the quest for revolutionary new treatments.                                                      Dolly creator Prof Ian Wilmut shuns cloning                                                                         The life and death of Dolly the diva, by Ian Wilmut                                               Dolly the Sheep scientist Prof Ian Wilmut exclusively revealed to The Daily Telegraph last week his intention to adopt the technique and abandon work on therapeutic human cloning because his is convinced that this new work overcomes key practical and ethical issues.          Both research groups have found a way to reprogram human skin cells so they cannot be distinguished from embryonic stem cells.         Although at an early stage, the technique holds out the promise of turning a scrape of cells from inside the cheek into embryonic like cells which can be used to repair almost any part of the body without having to clone human embryos.          This will spur research to develop these so called stem cells into the next generation treatments of degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, diabetes and Motor Neuron Disease, or repair damage caused by a stroke or heart attack.          As if to underline the significance of the breakthrough, Sir Martin Evans, the British stem cell pioneer who won the Nobel prize this year, said today that his team at Cardiff University will now study the new method to help make it simpler, safer and more straightforward so it could be used on patients. 'We have been waiting for this.'          The head of the Japanese team, Prof Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University added that it may also be possible to grow egg and sperm cells for infertility treatments, which raises the controversial possibility of growing eggs from men and sperm from women so that same sex couples could conceive a baby. 'At least in theory, it's possible,' Prof Yamanaka told The Daily Telegraph.          There is still work to be done to check and perfect the method but it looks likely to change the political and ethical landscape of this research as human embryos and eggs may no longer be needed to obtain blank slate 'stem cells' capable of becoming any of the 220 types of cells in the body, though many scientists are pressing for cloning to continue in basic research.          In one study, published in the journal Science, a team of University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers led by Jungian Yu and Prof James Thomson report the genetic reprogramming of type of human skin cells, called fibroblasts, to create cells indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells.         'It's going to completely change the field,' said Prof Thomson, adding they could be used today to create stem cells from patients with diseases to screen drugs.          The same feat is reported in the journal Cell by Prof Yamanaka with colleagues in Japan and America, the scientist who pioneered this approach of 'nuclear reprogramming' in mice. He too reports that a simple recipe turns human skin cells into embryonic stem cell-like cells, he calls 'iPS' cells.         From about 50,000 human cells treated with four factors introduced by a virus, his team obtained 10 distinct kinds of embryonic like cells.         'This efficiency may sound very low,' said Prof Yamanaka but in practice it means a single experiment in a Petri dish will yield several lines of embryo like cells, while cloning would require dozens of human eggs to achieve the same feat.          The iPS cells could form three basic types - primary germ layers - that in embryos eventually give rise to all the tissues and organs. His team also showed that they can be turned into brain cells and cardiac muscle cells, reporting how clumps of the latter in the laboratory started beating. 'These cells should be extremely useful in understanding disease mechanisms and screening effective and safe drugs,' he said.         'If we can overcome safety issues, we may be able to use human iPS cells in cell transplantation therapies.' But he warned that this work may still raise ethical concerns. 'It might be possible to generate sperm and eggs from skin cells, via iPS cells,' he said, a point echoed by Prof Thomson.         'This might help people with infertility problem, but it will be essential to have a proper regulation regarding the generation and usage of human iPS cells to avoid misuse of this technology.'          This has been cited as a way for a lesbian couple to create sperm, so they can have a child by IVF methods. However, Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London, said a scraping of skin could be used this way to make eggs but said it was unlikely that women could make sperm because to do this requires genes on the Y (male) chromosome. 'It is not possible to get sperm from an XX (female) cell however it is made.'          The chemical cocktail used to convert skin to embryo like cells is identical to one Prof Yamanaka's team showed could produce embryo like cells from adult mouse cells last year, consisting of factors that control the activity of other genes (so called transcription factors).          The Japanese recipe only shares two components - called Oct 4 and Sox2 - with the Wisconsin recipe, raising the extraordinary possibility that just two factors could be all it takes to wind back the clock and turn an adult cell into an embryonic one, an economy that would amaze most scientists.         'My guess is that those two are the really essential ones,' Prof Thomson told the Telegraph, adding 'the others probably increase the efficiency. It is completely remarkable that such a limited set works.'          Human embryonic stem cells and those derived from skin cells display similar patterns of gene activity. But Prof Yamanaka emphasised it would be 'premature to conclude that iPS cells can replace embryonic stem cells 'and added that the way this method worked 'is still like a black box.'          A comprehensive screen of the activity of tens of thousands of genes showed that iPS cells are highly similar, though not identical in the use of around 1000 genes, to embryonic stem cells. Like Prof Yamanaka, Prof Thomson stresses that more study is required to ensure that the 'cells do not differ from embryonic stem cells in a clinically significant or unexpected way.'          Thus, he added, 'it is hardly time to discontinue embryonic stem cell research.' In addition, he said that much more work is required to make the treatment safer, notably do away with the viruses used to ferry the genes into the skin cells.          Prof Thomson was the first coaxed stem cells from human embryos in 1998 and says that, in America where Government policy has denied federal funding for such research, this breakthrough will be a boon.          To find that as few as two genes are capable of transforming adult skin cells to embryonic stem cells helps resolve a critical question posed by Dolly, the famous sheep cloned by Prof Wilmut in 1996. 'This all comes back to Dolly,' said Prof Thomson.          Dolly was the result of the nucleus of an adult cell transferred to an unfertilised egg, in a method called nuclear transfer. An unknown combination of factors in the egg caused the adult cell nucleus to be reprogrammed and, when implanted in a surrogate mother, develop into a fully formed animal, a discovery that shocked scientists at the time. The feat amazed scientists of the day but the new work shows this transformation could be down to just two factors.          Prof Ian Wilmut, Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, said: ' The fact that introduction of a small number of proteins into adult human cells could produce cells that are equivalent to embryo stem cells takes us into an entirely new era of stem cell biology.         'We can now envisage a time when a simple approach can be used to produce stem cells that are able to form any tissue from a small sample taken from any of us. This will have enormous implications for research and perhaps one day for therapy.'                     Comments                              Deepak Srivastava, Director of the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, said: 'Dr Yamanaka's work is monumental in its importance to the field of stem cell science and its potential impact on our ability to accelerate the benefits of this technology to the bedside.         'Not only does this discovery enable more research, it offers a new pathway to apply the benefits of stem cells to human disease.'                     Prof Alta Charo, Univesity of Wisconsin-Madison professor of law and bioethics: 'This is a method for creating a stem cell line without ever having to work through, at any stage, an entity that is a viable embryo. Therefore, you manage to avoid many of those debates with the right-to life community.'          It's going to fuel those who call for preferential federal funding only for non-embryonic stem cell research and it will certainly complicate any efforts to expand funding for embryonic stem cell research at the federal level,' she says.         'Twice, the US Congress has passed legislation to overturn the Bush administration policy on embryonic stem cell research and allow funding for research using any embryonic stem cell lines, not just those designated by the administration in 2001. Twice, the president has vetoed it.'                     Prof Azim Surani, University of Cambridge, said: 'It is relatively easy to grow an entire plant from a small cutting, something that seems inconceivable in humans. Yet this study brings us tantalisingly close to using skin cells to grow many different types of human tissues.         'This method will allow derivation of a large repertoire of human stem cells, including those from patients with complex diseases, which could be used to examine how different disease states develop, and how to prevent or cure them.'                     Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, Head of Developmental Genetics, MRC National Institute For Medical Research, said: 'The work from the Yamanaka and Thomson labs is very exciting. This approach to derive patient-specific Embryonic Stem cell-like cells (iPS cells) is going to open up research into the genetic causes of disease and the search for therapies not only for such diseases, but also for repairing tissues damaged in other ways.          However, the techniques still need some work. It will be important to find ways of reprogramming skin, or other cells, that do not rely on viruses, moreover, the relatively low frequencies obtained need an explanation, as do the differences between the iPS cells and ES cells and in the specific genes used in the two papers.'         'One of the long term aims of the research on human ES cells and 'therapeutic cloning' was the hope that this would lead to direct reprogramming to avoid the use of embryos. This has just come sooner than any of us thought.         'This unpredictability is one of the fantastic things about science, and is itself a reason why research avenues should always be open. While these new methods may surpass some of the needs for the use of cloning technology, they do not replace all, and the more we understand reprogramming with either method, the better we will be able to achieve our aims, which are to benefit mankind, not to do evil.'                     Dr Robert Lanza, chief science officer of American company Advanced Cell Technology, which has been trying to extract stem cells from cloned human embryos: 'This work represents a tremendous scientific milestone - the biological equivalent of the Wright Brothers' first airplane.'         Or, he added, 'it's a bit like learning how to turn lead into gold,' cautioning that the work remains far from providing medical payoffs."
telegraph,19/06/2010 20:30,news,"Scientists claim they will be able to unravel the secrets of how to live a healthy life from the human genome ahead of the 10th anniversary of the completion of the first draft of the 'book of life'.It was hailed as a breakthrough that would bring about a “revolution” in   medical science and was even described by some as a bigger achievement for   mankind than landing on the Moon.The announcement that scientists had for the first time been able to unravel   and read entire human genome – the DNA instruction manual that underpins all   human life – sparked hopes that some of the world’s most deadly diseases   could finally be beaten. But ten years after Tony Blair and Bill Clinton jointly announced that   scientists had managed to decipher the book of life, many of the predicted   benefits are still to be realised. Instead the human genome project has   provided scientists with more questions than answers. Yet as they prepare to mark the 10th anniversary of the completion of the   first draft of the human genome, researchers now claim to be poised on the   edge of a development that will finally bring benefits of the £2 billion   project to everyone. Hidden within our DNA, they say, are the secrets that will teach us how to   live a healthy life. Geneticists have discovered that the malfunctioning genes that cause many   major diseases, including cancer, heart disease and diabetes, also carry   distinctive signatures that can reveal what caused the malfunctions, or   mutations, of the DNA in the first place. “We can look at the genome of a cancer cell and we can see writ, as a kind of   archaeological record, what caused those mutations maybe 20 or 30 years   ago,” explained Professor Mike Stratton, director of the Wellcome Trust’s   Sanger Institute – the British arm of the efforts to sequence the human   genome, which is leading work to exploit the information it contains. The Sanger Institute is now leading efforts to sequence the genomes of cancer   cells taken from 25,000 patients around the world in a bid to unravel the   full repertoire of genetic differences that make cancerous tissue different   from healthy tissue. Researchers on the project have already been able to compare the DNA taken   from a lung cancer cell with that of a healthy cell and prove that it   carries a characteristic set of differences that reveal the cancer was   caused by smoking. As they peer deeper into the genome for more of these telltale signatures,   they hope they will be able to provide some definitive answers about the   things that are good and bad for our health. They may even be able to answer confusing debates about whether treats like   chocolate, coffee and red wine are harmful or beneficial to our health, as   current scientific studies have produced conflicting results. Professor Stratton said: “Now we are going to look in 25,000 cancers over the   next five to 10 years to look for other signatures and they will tell us   what was involved in causing those cancers. This is going to be   transforming.”The completion of the first draft of the full sequence of the human genome on   26 June 2000 was the culmination of 10 years’ work and the contribution of   hundreds of scientists from around the world. This week the Science   Museum in London will open a new exhibition detailing some of the   achievements since that date. Before the publication of the genome, biologists believed our DNA would   contain hundreds of thousands of genes needed to provide all the building   blocks that make up the human body. In a surprise that rocked the biological community to its core, however, the   human genome project revealed there are just 22,000 genes encoded in human   DNA. It did not seem enough to explain our complex nature. Indeed a parasite made   up of a single cell, called a trichomoniasis, has been found to have three   times as many genes in its genome. The findings have revealed that our genomes are far more complicated than was   originally thought and it has become apparent that a single gene does not   code for a single biological trait. Height, for example, is an easily-observed trait that is passed down through   families and was thought to have a simple genetic explanation. In fact more than 100 genes have been identified to be implicated in   determining height and scientists believe there could be up to 1,000. “Effectively, the human genome was written in a different language from what   we expected,” said Professor Steve Jones, a leading geneticist at University   College London. “Taking the genome apart was the easy bit, even though it was an extraordinary   technical achievement. The hope was that by taking it apart, you would be   able to infer how it worked but this has not happened.”There were hopes the publication of the complete human genome would lead to   the ability to identify new treatments for common diseases and patients   could be screened for the risk of illness. It was even claimed that by the time of Saturday’s anniversary, patients would   be receiving personalised medicine where drugs would be tailored   specifically to match an individuals own genetic make-up. In reality, however, the progress has been far slower than expected and many   of these predicted benefits have still to be realised. The pharmaceutical industry has spend billions in the hope of reaping rewards   from our genomes, but so far only a handful of drugs have made it to market. “In many cases the hopes that simple answers would be found from the human   genome have turned out to be a complete bust,” said Professor Jones. He   believes that the genome has had other less obvious but significant   benefits. He said: “Genomes have transformed our idea of what life is and our ideas of   human history. Everybody is essentially a living fossil as our entire   evolutionary history is contained within our DNA. Palaeontologists are now able to compare our modern human genome with genetic   material obtained from fossilised bones of our forebears to draw new   conclusions about what they may have been like and even how they spread   around the globe. Surprisingly we differ very little on a genetic level from other species. We   share 96 per cent of our genes with chimpanzees while 80 per cent of our   genes are the same as those found in mice. There are now also hopes that new technology that is allowing the human   genomes to be sequenced in a matter of weeks and months rather than years is   also going to lead new ways of diagnosing diseases. Francis Collins, the geneticist who led the Human Genome Project in the US,   said: “There is variation between individuals that are now becoming clear.   We have already discovered almost a 1,000 variations in the genome that play   a role in human diseases.”For Professor Jones, however, the human genome has also underlined how despite   our technical achievements, humans are still subject to will of the   environment around them. “The more we are learning about our individual genetics, the more we should be   concerned about the environment we place ourselves in,” he warned. “It is strange, but rather than finding cures, perhaps genetics is going to   focus our attention on behaving on a sensible manner.”The Science   Museum's Who Am I? exhibition which examines what the Human Genome   Project has taught us about neuroscience and human identity, will open on   Saturday June 26."
dailymail,5/6/2015 12:06,wires,"By Sharon Begley and Caroline HumerNEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is in arace against Google Inc to store data on human DNA,seeking both bragging rights in helping scientists make newmedical discoveries and market share in a business that may beworth $1 billion a year by 2018.Academic institutions and healthcare companies are pickingsides between their cloud computing offerings - Google Genomicsor Amazon Web Services - spurring the two to one-up each otheras they win high-profile genomics business, according tointerviews with researchers, industry consultants andanalysts.That growth is being propelled by, among other forces, thepush for personalized medicine, which aims to base treatments ona patient's DNA profile. Making that a reality will requireenormous quantities of data to reveal how particular geneticprofiles respond to different treatments.Already, universities and drug manufacturers are embarkingon projects to sequence the genomes of hundreds of thousands ofpeople. The human genome is the full complementof DNA, or genetic material, a copy of which is found in nearlyevery cell of the body.Clients view Google and Amazon as doing a better job storinggenomics data than they can do using their own computers,keeping it secure, controlling costs and allowing it to beeasily shared.The cloud companies are going beyond storage to offeranalytical functions that let scientists make sense of DNA data.Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines are also competing for a slice of the market. The'cloud' refers to data or software that physically resides in aserver and is accessible via the internet, which allows users toaccess it without downloading it to their own computer.Now an estimated $100 million to $300 million businessglobally, the cloud genomics market is expected to grow to $1billion by 2018, said research analyst Daniel Ives of investmentbank FBR Capital. By that time, the entire cloud market shouldhave $50 billion to $75 billion in annual revenue, up from about$30 billion now.'The cloud is the entire future of this field,' CraigVenter, who led a private effort to sequence the human genome inthe 1990s, said in an interview. His new company, SanDiego-based Human Longevity Inc, recently tried to importgenomic data from servers at the J. Craig Venter Institute inRockville, Maryland.The transmission was so slow, scientists had to resort tosending disks and thumb drives by FedEx and human messengers, or'sneakernet,' he said. The company now uses Amazon Web Services.So does a collaboration between Regeneron PharmaceuticalsInc. and Pennsylvania-based Geisinger Health Systems tosequence 250,000 genomes. Raw DNA data is uploaded to Amazon'scloud, where software from privately-held DNAnexus assembles themillions of chunks into the full, 3-billion-letter long genome.DNAnexus's algorithms then determine where an individualgenome differs from the 'reference' human genome, the company'schief scientist Dr. David Shaywitz said, in hopes of identifyingnew drug targets.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>HEALTH-GENOMICS-CLOUD: How pharmaceutical researchers use Amazonweb services to store and analyze DNA sequences.http://link.reuters.com/kan84w>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>HOSTING FOR FREEShowing how important Google and Amazon view this business,and how they hope to use existing customers to lure future ones,each is hosting well-known genomics datasets for free.Neither company discloses the amount of genomics data itholds, but based on interviews with analysts and genomicscientists, as well as the companies' own announcements of whatcustomers they've won, Amazon Web Services may be bigger.Data from the '1000 Genomes Project,' an internationalpublic-private effort that identified genetic variations foundin at least 1 percent of humans, reside at both Amazon andGoogle 'without charge,' said Kathy Cravedi of the U.S. NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH), one of the project's sponsors.Other paying clients with a more specific focus are pickingsides.Google, for instance, won a project from the Autism Speaksfoundation to collect and analyze the genomes of 10,000 affectedchildren and their parents for clues to the genetic basis ofautism.Another customer is Tute Genomics, whose database of 8.5billion human DNA variants can be searched for how frequentlyany given variant appears, what traits it's associated with andhow people with a certain variant respond to particular drugs.Amazon is hosting the Multiple Myeloma Foundation's projectto collect complete-genome sequences and other data from 1,000patients to identify new drug targets. It also won theAlzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, which has similar aims.Amazon charges about $4 to $5 a month to store one fullhuman genome, and Google about $3 to $5 a month. The companiesalso charge for data transfers or computing time, as whenscientists run analytical software on stored data.Amazon's database-analysis tool, Redshift, costs 25 cents anhour or $1,000 per terabyte per year, the company said. Aterabyte is 1 trillion bytes, or 1,000 gigabytes, about enoughto hold 300 hours of high-quality video.GENETIC GOLDAnother part of the cloud services' pitch to would-becustomers is that their analytic tools can fish out genetic gold- a drug target, say, or a DNA variant that strongly predictsdisease risk - from a sea of data. Any discoveries made throughsuch searches belong to the owners of the data.'On the local university server it might take months to runa computationally-intense' analysis, said Alzheimer's projectleader Dr. Gerard Schellenberg of the University ofPennsylvania. 'On Amazon, it's, 'how fast do you need it done?',and they do it.'Another selling point is security. Universities are'generally pretty porous,' said Ryan Permeh, chief scientist atcybersecurity company Cylance Inc., of Irvine, California, andthe security of federal government computers is 'not at the topof the class.'While academic and pharmaceutical research projects are thebiggest customers for genomics cloud services, they will beovertaken by clinical applications in the next 10 years, saidGoogle Genomics director of engineering David Glazer.Individual doctors will regularly access a cloud service tounderstand how a patient's genetic profile affects his risk ofvarious diseases or his likely response to medication.'We are at that transition point now,' Glazer said.Matt Wood, general manager for Data Science at Amazon WebServices, sees cloud demand in genomics now as 'a perfectstorm,' as the amount of data being created, the need forcollaboration and the move of genomics into clinical careaccelerate.Experts on DNA and data say without access to the cloud,modern genomics would grind to a halt.Bioinformatics expert Dr. Atul Butte of the University ofCalifornia, San Francisco, said that now, when researchers atdifferent universities are jointly working on NIH and othergenomic data, they don't have to figure out how to make theircomputers talk to each other. In March, NIH cleared the way formajor research on the cloud when it began allowing scientists toupload important genomic data.'My response was, it's about time,' Butte said.(Reporting by Sharon Begley and Caroline Humer; Editing byMichele Gershberg and John Pickering)"
telegraph,11/6/2012 11:23,news,"Children of older fathers and grandfathers are more likely to live longer, research suggests.Experts found that children with older fathers had longer 'telomeres',   which are tiny caps on the ends of chromosomes that protect against ageing   processes. Like the tabs on the end of shoe laces which prevent fraying, these vital   strips of DNA make cells less vulnerable to disease. Professor Christopher Kuzawa, an anthropologist at Northwestern University in   the United States, said in most cells telomeres shorten with time. However, in sperm they lengthen. So, men who reproduce at an older age have   children with longer telomeres compared with younger fathers. Older fathers are often blamed for passing on genetic mutations to their   children, causing some forms of autism, schizophrenia and other disorders. The researchers measured the telomere length of DNA in the blood of 1,779   young Filipino adults and their mothers and determined the ages of the   children's fathers and grandfathers. They found an individual's telomeres lengthened not only with their father's   age at their birth, but also with their paternal grandfather's age at their   father's birth. This shows the effect is amplified over the generations –   the paternal grandfather's age is associated with longer telomeres in his   grandchildren. The increase per year of a man's delay in reproduction roughly equalled the   amount of annual telomere shortening observed in middle-age adults. The findings published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences   suggest delayed paternal reproduction can lead to cumulative,   multi-generational increases in telomere length in descendants – which could   promote long life. Telomeres have been called the 'chromosomal clock' because they seem   to be central to biological ageing. Longer telomeres are a sign of being   biologically younger and healthier. Prof Kuzawa said: 'Although it is well established telomere length   shortens with age in most proliferating tissues sperm is an exception –   older men have sperm with longer telomeres.  'This may be explained by the fact the activity of telomerase – an   enzyme that extends telomere length – is high in testes.  'Consistent with the fact offspring inherit half their chromosomes from   sperm, offspring of older fathers tend to have longer telomeres.' In contrast telomere length in female reproductive cells in the womb are   believed to be stable with age and there is no evidence for a maternal   effect in offspring. Prof Kuzawa said: 'In this large sample from the Philippines, we found   that telomeres measured in blood were longer in individuals whose paternal   grandfathers were older at their father's birth.  'This effect was equal in size, and additive to, the longer telomere   length predicted by a delay in the father's age at their own birth,   suggesting that paternal age at reproduction has effects on telomere length   that are transmitted with high fidelity and cumulatively across at least two   generations.  'The longer telomere length predicted by each year that paternal or   grandpaternal reproduction was delayed was comparable to the yearly   shortening in telomere length seen in older individuals in this population,   suggesting that these intergenerational changes may be biologically   important.  'These findings point to a mechanism by which shifts in the age of   paternal reproduction within a population can lead to cumulative,   multigenerational changes in telomere length in descendants.' A previous study of over sixties found those in the top half of the range of   telomere lengths lived four to five years longer than those in the bottom   half. People with shorter telomeres had a threefold increased risk of dying from   heart disease and were over eight times as likely to die from infection. Prof Kuzawa said his team's finding could be a mechanism by which humans could   extend late-life function as average age at reproduction is delayed within a   lineage. He said: 'We speculate an effect of the age of paternal ancestors on   telomere length could allow increases in life expectancy under demographic   conditions of low mortality and delayed reproduction, when investment in a   more durable and long-lived body is likely to reap higher fitness returns.'

telegraph,6/1/2004 0:01,news,"   Should new parents be encouraged to store umbilical cord blood? Christine Doyle investigates   Georgina Askins had been very lucky with the health of her first four children, but when Bonnie, her fifth baby, was born last February, she decided to give her the potential benefit of an unusual safeguard against future disease.Immediately after the birth, blood from the placenta was collected through the umbilical cord, and the blood sample was delivered to a Belgian laboratory, where technicians extracted master stem cells. These were then frozen, to be used should Bonnie develop leukaemia or another life-threatening blood disorder in the next 20 years.Umbilical cord blood is an enriched source of specific stem cells from blood in the placenta. When transplanted by intravenous injection, such cells can generate a whole new system of white and red blood cells. Quite how the cells find their way to the bone marrow and activate this process is still not clearly understood. The collection and storage of the stem cells were carried out by CryoCare, and cost just under £1,000. The obstetrician at Bonnie's birth, which took place at an independent hospital, collected the blood using a 'cord blood kit'. 'It took about 10 minutes and was very easy,' says Mrs Askins. 'As parents, we see this as a kind of health insurance – and not just for Bonnie. Her brothers' and sisters' stem cells are likely to be reasonably closely matched to Bonnie's, so they may also benefit. I don't mind paying; it's part of my family's health care.'Rapidly expanding research also offers hope that cord blood may contain other immature stem cells, which some scientists believe might eventually be used to treat strokes, Parkinson's disease and heart failure. (Umbilical cord stem cells are distinct from embryo stem cells, which some people object to using on moral grounds.)In America, Japan and – more recently – Europe, storage of umbilical stem cells is attracting huge interest. Every year, more than 100,000 American women are believed to provide cord blood samples to protect their children's health.A growing number of parents who have their babies in NHS hospitals now request this service, though it has to be carried out by a commercial company. Some have been spurred into action after reading about parents who have had a baby in order to provide stem cells that closely match the tissue type of an older child with a life-threatening blood disorder.Many NHS hospitals permit the collection of cord blood using the commercial kit; others, however, are reluctant to co-operate. Not only does the process put pressure on overstretched midwives, but some NHS trusts fear lawsuits if a sample is incorrectly collected. Others consider it to be an unacceptable mix of public and private medicine.'We had to overcome the resistance of midwives,' says Eleena Ahmed, whose son Kamal, now eight months old, was born at the William Harvey NHS hospital in Ashford, Kent. 'My midwife had only collected cord blood once before, when there had been some confusion. However, my husband insisted that it was very easy. He had all the information about the private collection kit and, eventually, the midwives agreed. All those who might be on duty when I went into labour were briefed and there were no problems. We think that, eventually, the NHS should offer this procedure to all parents.'On cost grounds, this seems highly unlikely. But is it justifiable on clinical grounds? Understandably, parents want to do all they can to protect their children, yet mainstream medical opinion in Britain does not support the collection of cord blood stem cells for future use in low-risk families.CryoCare, the market leader in storing and freezing the cells, wants to see all women informed about stem cell collection, so that they can make their own choice. 'The reluctance in NHS hospitals [to carry out this procedure] is partly due to Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidelines two years ago,' says a spokesman. The college ruled that the routine collection of cord blood for personal use by women at low risk could not be recommended because of insufficient evidence to support the practice and the difficulties of collecting the blood.'We see no reason to change that view. If anything, we feel the scientific evidence more strongly supports our view than it did two years ago,' says Professor Nick Fisk, chairman of the scientific advisory committee that drew up the guidelines. 'Normally, we review such guidelines every three years, but in response to a letter from CryoCare, we recently had a brief reassessment.'The possibility that pre-leukaemic cells could be present while the baby is in the womb suggests a cautious approach, says Prof Fisk.'An exact match of stem cells taken at birth from a child who later becomes ill might, in some instances, lead to a risk of renewed cancer later. Recent research about Down's syndrome children, who are more prone than others to leukaemia, suggests the pre-cancerous cells are present in the womb.' The parents I spoke to were not aware of this possibility, but they had no regrets about storing their children's stem cells. The research results do not apply to all blood disorders and could be a setback only if there is a genetic predisposition to one of these diseases.Rapid expansion in successful treatments also suggests that there may be less reliance on perfect tissue matches than in the past. Professor Stephen Proctor, a consultant haematologist at Newcastle Royal Infirmary, says: 'There is increasing evidence that fairly well-matched, unrelated stem cell transplants – and unrelated bone marrow transplants – are successful. There is also evidence that we can use two unrelated transplants. A child in Newcastle had one stem cell transplant from America and another from this country and is doing really well with a blood system 'borrowed' from two sources.'Peter Hollands, a senior lecturer in biomedical science and medical advisor to CryoCare, says: 'Cord blood is a biological medical insurance and it is a crying shame to see it being thrown away.' Prof Fisk points out that it will probably not be necessary to rely on umbilical stem cells for use in treating heart or neural diseases. Stem cells are increasingly available from other sources and tissues – even a child's first tooth. They also have wide-ranging 'plasticity', with the possibility of growing into whatever type of cell is required for treatment.Prof Proctor is all for parental choice, but adds: 'They must understand that the chance of using their own baby's cells is extremely unlikely.' Based on an American estimate, the RCOG puts it at one in 10,000. 'Thus, umbilical cord stem cells have a much greater chance of use if they are stored as a collective asset and are available worldwide,' says Prof Fisk.There is a stem cell bank based at the London National Blood Service, which collects from women who consent to donate for universal benefit. Another in the North is directed by Prof Proctor but, because of inadequate funding, can only offer a restricted service. Belfast has a centre, and Scotland will follow shortly.Meanwhile, Prof Fisk says the RCOG is writing to the Advertising Standards Authority about an advertisement by CryoCare in the magazine Baby and You, 'which suggests we support collection of stem cells from children at low risk of developing blood disorder'.In other promotional literature and on the web, it is suggested that storing stem cells at birth is a once-only opportunity, which might one day save the baby's life. This does not make it easy for concerned parents to decide. Many might hesitate before spending £1,000, as I think I would myself, when research is expanding so rapidly and expert opinion is beginning to favour the universal, or 'altruistic', storage of blood stem cells.How can cord blood be donated?     'Altruistic' stem cell blood banks: women donate cord blood for transplant into unrelated recipients anywhere in the world. The three main centres (in the South-East, the North and Northern Ireland) collect from maternity hospitals.      'Directed donations' in at-risk families: in some centres, cord blood from newborns in families with a known genetic blood disorder is collected and banked for that child or a sibling.        Commercial donations for use in low-risk families: parents pay to bank blood in case child develops life-threatening blood disorder.

telegraph,20/11/2005 00:01,news,"A vast 'bank' of human stem cells is to be brought to Britain, bringing hope of new cures for fatal genetic diseases but fuelling ethical concerns about embryo research.          More than 140 stem cell lines - the building blocks of human life - have been created by specialists in the United States and allied clinics in Russia, Cyprus and Belize using donated IVF embryos.          The private bank, the largest of its kind in the world, will be made available without charge to British researchers hoping to find cures for inherited diseases including the degenerative disorder Huntington's, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the blood disorder beta-thalassaemia.          A pioneering method of 'tailoring' stem cells to a particular patient, which avoids the need for embryo cloning, will also be brought to Britain.          The fertility specialist Mohammed Taranissi will side-step strict laws governing embryo research to import the stem cells next month. Because the embryos were created overseas, a licence from the Government's fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, will not be needed.          The bank and new technology represents a huge scientific resource that will speed up the search for new drugs and cures for devastating conditions.          But last night British experts urged caution, claiming that more information was needed about the bank's stem cell lines before they were used for research purposes.          Stem cells are gathered from embryos at an early stage of development and once removed have the power to keep on growing, creating a 'line' that can be frozen and stored.          They can grow into any of the 220 types of tissue in the body, offering scientists the best hope of cures for many disorders.          The new private bank will also contain 18 colonies of embryonic stem cells with defects linked to 10 congenital diseases in addition to more than 120 lines of normal human stem cells - five times the number currently available to British scientists using the Medical Research Council's own, much smaller stem cell bank.          Eleven teams of scientists are currently licensed to produce stem cells in Britain but the availability of such a vast number of stem cell lines could lead to more research units.          Mr Taranissi, of the Assisted Reproduction and Gynaecology Centre in London, is the co-owner of the bank which is based at the Reproductive Genetics Institute in Chicago. Its creator, Yury Verlinsky, gained worldwide acclaim in 2001 when he made the first 'designer IVF baby' to save a sick child from a rare blood disorder.          Mr Taranissi said: 'I know some people will be concerned but this is a huge potential resource for British science. This stem cell research is the future.'          Mr Taranissi has already written to the Medical Research Council offering the stem cell lines, which will be stored at his clinic in central London.          But a leading scientist, Stephen Minger, the director of stem cell biology at the Wolfson Institute and King's College London, said: 'Producing stem cell lines is not easy and there may be concerns about quality.'           Many ethical campaigners believe that research using embryonic stem cells is morally repugnant because human embryos have to be destroyed to create them.          Josephine Quintavalle, of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said yesterday: 'We have had IVF tourism and the last thing we want is research tourism with an embryonic stem cell bank coming from abroad.' A method pioneered by Dr Verlinsky which will also come to Britain with the stem cells avoids the need for repeated embryo cloning in order to obtain stem cells.          The 'stembrid' technique takes a stem cell from one of the stored 'lines' in the bank. The nucleus of the stem cell is removed and fused with a cell from the body of the patient - such as a skin cell.          The 'stembrid' cell then reprogrammes the nucleus of the patient's cell and turns it into a stem cell that is tailored to suit that patient's immune system."

'The reluctance in NHS hospitals [to carry out this procedure] is partly due to Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidelines two years ago,' says a spokesman. The college ruled that the routine collection of cord blood for personal use by women at low risk could not be recommended because of insufficient evidence to support the practice and the difficulties of collecting the blood.'We see no reason to change that view. If anything, we feel the scientific evidence more strongly supports our view than it did two years ago,' says Professor Nick Fisk, chairman of the scientific advisory committee that drew up the guidelines. 'Normally, we review such guidelines every three years, but in response to a letter from CryoCare, we recently had a brief reassessment.'The possibility that pre-leukaemic cells could be present while the baby is in the womb suggests a cautious approach, says Prof Fisk.'An exact match of stem cells taken at birth from a child who later becomes ill might, in some instances, lead to a risk of renewed cancer later. Recent research about Down's syndrome children, who are more prone than others to leukaemia, suggests the pre-cancerous cells are present in the womb.' The parents I spoke to were not aware of this possibility, but they had no regrets about storing their children's stem cells. The research results do not apply to all blood disorders and could be a setback only if there is a genetic predisposition to one of these diseases.Rapid expansion in successful treatments also suggests that there may be less reliance on perfect tissue matches than in the past. Professor Stephen Proctor, a consultant haematologist at Newcastle Royal Infirmary, says: 'There is increasing evidence that fairly well-matched, unrelated stem cell transplants – and unrelated bone marrow transplants – are successful. There is also evidence that we can use two unrelated transplants. A child in Newcastle had one stem cell transplant from America and another from this country and is doing really well with a blood system 'borrowed' from two sources.'Peter Hollands, a senior lecturer in biomedical science and medical advisor to CryoCare, says: 'Cord blood is a biological medical insurance and it is a crying shame to see it being thrown away.' Prof Fisk points out that it will probably not be necessary to rely on umbilical stem cells for use in treating heart or neural diseases. Stem cells are increasingly available from other sources and tissues – even a child's first tooth. They also have wide-ranging 'plasticity', with the possibility of growing into whatever type of cell is required for treatment.Prof Proctor is all for parental choice, but adds: 'They must understand that the chance of using their own baby's cells is extremely unlikely.' Based on an American estimate, the RCOG puts it at one in 10,000. 'Thus, umbilical cord stem cells have a much greater chance of use if they are stored as a collective asset and are available worldwide,' says Prof Fisk.There is a stem cell bank based at the London National Blood Service, which collects from women who consent to donate for universal benefit. Another in the North is directed by Prof Proctor but, because of inadequate funding, can only offer a restricted service. Belfast has a centre, and Scotland will follow shortly.Meanwhile, Prof Fisk says the RCOG is writing to the Advertising Standards Authority about an advertisement by CryoCare in the magazine Baby and You, 'which suggests we support collection of stem cells from children at low risk of developing blood disorder'.In other promotional literature and on the web, it is suggested that storing stem cells at birth is a once-only opportunity, which might one day save the baby's life. This does not make it easy for concerned parents to decide. Many might hesitate before spending £1,000, as I think I would myself, when research is expanding so rapidly and expert opinion is beginning to favour the universal, or 'altruistic', storage of blood stem cells.How can cord blood be donated?     'Altruistic' stem cell blood banks: women donate cord blood for transplant into unrelated recipients anywhere in the world. The three main centres (in the South-East, the North and Northern Ireland) collect from maternity hospitals.      'Directed donations' in at-risk families: in some centres, cord blood from newborns in families with a known genetic blood disorder is collected and banked for that child or a sibling.        Commercial donations for use in low-risk families: parents pay to bank blood in case child develops life-threatening blood disorder.

telegraph,6/5/2014 6:45,news,"Telomeres – the little stretches of DNA that hold our chromosomes together – could hold the answers to switching off the ageing processWhy do we get old? It is, on the face of it, a puzzle. Cells can effect   repairs, and divide to make new copies of themselves – they’ve been doing it   for four billion years, give or take. So why do the cells in our bodies wear   out? Why, after a few short decades, do they stop working? The search for the key to ageing – and a means of slowing or reversing it – is   far older than anything we’d call science. In ancient China around 200?bc, a   Qin emperor sent an alchemist Xu Fu to the eastern seas to find the elixir   of life; medieval alchemists sought the “philosopher’s stone” which, as well   as transmuting base metals into gold, was said to prolong the life of anyone   who ate a piece of it. (They didn’t find it, and many of them are believed   to have suffered from mercury poisoning as a result of their   investigations.) A more scientific version of this quest is still going on. As The Telegraph reported   on Sunday, scientists at the University of California have found that   mature mice can be rejuvenated with transfusions of blood from younger ones.   For the past few decades, however, the main focus of attention has been on   little stretches of DNA on the end of our chromosomes, called telomeres. “The best analogy that we have for telomeres is that they’re like the little   tabs on the end of shoelaces,” says Dr Adam Rutherford, a geneticist and   author of Creation: The Origin of Life. Just as the tabs, or “aglets”, hold   the strands of the laces together, he says, telomeres – repetitive stretches   of DNA on the end of each chromosome – perform the same function. “Chromosomes are made up of a double helix, two strands of DNA, and they need   an endpoint,” says Rutherford. “Without telomeres they’d unravel, like two   bits of string that have been tied together.”Telomeres are simple in structural terms, but play a crucial role: they’re not   genes, they don’t code for anything, but cells cannot reproduce without   them. They are also key to ageing. “Every time the cells go through a division and the chromosome is reproduced,   it loses telomeres,” Rutherford explains. Our cells find it hard to copy the   very tips of chromosomes and, slowly, the aglet is worn away from the end of   the lace; the telomeres are depleted through repeated division. “This seems to be a key part of why cells die during the ageing process,”   Rutherford says. This eventual death of cells is called senescence, from the   Latin senex, meaning old man. “When a cell gets to the point that it has no   telomeres left, it won’t be able to divide again. Or if it does, it’ll be   messed up.”So the next question is, if we can restore the telomeres in elderly cells,   might that stop them – and us – getting old? That’s been the goal of researchers for a while. In the Nineties, Dr Elizabeth   Blackburn and colleagues at the University of California won the Nobel prize   for the discovery of telomerase, an enzyme that replenishes the telomeres in   cells. The enzyme is usually “switched off”, but there is one kind of cell   in which it demonstrates its potential in an often lethal way. “In cancer   cells,” says Dr Kat Arney, a scientist at Cancer Research UK, “telomerase is   switched on. And they become immortal.” Cancer cells can divide repeatedly   without ever growing old, but this sort of uncontrolled growth has the   unfortunate side-effect of killing the organism it’s growing in. Telomerase may have a role to play in future treatments, according to   Rutherford. “Telomeres are undoubtedly a key part of ageing, and the   discovery of telomerase was a significant moment in understanding why cells   don’t continue to reproduce forever, why they’re not immortal. If we could   target that process of losing telomeres, with drugs or whatever, you could   possibly maintain a longer shelf-life for a cell, it could continue   reproducing far longer than its natural life. I don’t think it’s just   science fiction; I think it’s genuinely a worthy topic of research with   therapeutics in mind.”In the shorter term, says Arney, telomere research may play a part in the   fight against cancer. Since telomerase is found in cancer cells, some   scientists thought they could target cancer cells in this way. “There was a   massive trial into a vaccine against telomerase, called TeloVac, training   the immune system to recognise it so that it would detect it in cancer   cells,” says Arney. The trial showed no improvement over the standard   chemotherapy treatment for the pancreatic cancer it targeted, but there is   hope for other treatments in future. Second, telomere loss is itself associated with cancers. When a cell’s   telomeres are depleted, the chromosomes’ ends flap loose. “Cells hate loose   ends of DNA,” says Arney. “If they come across some, they try to stitch them   together, because they assume something’s gone wrong.” And if they stitch   two flapping chromosomes together, “you get all sorts of mutations”, often   causing cancer. Understanding telomerase could help prevent this. As the function of telomeres becomes better understood, some private companies   including Telomere Health and Life Length have begun offering to measure an   individual’s chromosomal length, and so determine their “biological age”, as   opposed to the chronological age. It is known that people with shorter   telomeres are more likely to suffer various diseases, including diabetes,   Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, and tend to die younger. One study found that   people with shorter telomeres were eight times more likely to die from an   infection and three times more likely to die from a heart attack. The trouble is, says Rutherford, that the history of biology warns us that   things are always complicated. “In biology, there is never one thing. For   every rule that we have, we find a bunch of exceptions to it. And with   genetics in particular, we’ve revealed a picture of complexity, rather than   simplicity. In physics, things tend to get simpler the more we understand   them. In biology, they tend to get more complex. Biology is messy.”Telomeres “aren’t the only show in town”, says Rutherford, and there are many   other research projects under way, from the serious to the seriously wacky.   Research, again at the University of California, found that the lifespan of   the roundworm C. elegans could be doubled by modifying two genes involved in   cell repair, while this year the maverick scientist Craig Venter began a   huge project sequencing human genes to find the ones that control longevity.   And restricting the calorific intake of mice has been shown to extend their   lives, sometimes dramatically. “Humans are trying that – there’s a weird   cult in California of calorific restriction people, who eat some desperately   low number of calories a day,” says Rutherford. There are two problems with   this: one, individuals tend to be severely immuno?compromised because of   poor nutrition and get ill very easily, and two – “they all look absolutely   miserable,” he says. “They eat about four pieces of lettuce a day. They   might live forever, but they’re going to have an awful quality of life.”There is a question, of course, over how far we would want to extend life. As   Rutherford points out, merely extending old age would not be much of an   achievement – the goal must be to extend the healthy years of life. And even   if we can manage that, there would be ethical questions; life expectancy is   already linked to class and wealth, but this would make that link direct and   explicit. Of course, the world is already struggling with overpopulation and   ageing societies. That won’t stop scientists, though, and to date they agree that telomere   research is the most promising avenue for extending life. “If we can slow   the process of telomere loss, the fundamental cap on how often your cells   can reproduce might be removed, or at least reduced,” Rutherford says. It’s not an elixir of life; there will be no elixir of life. But this is the   best science can do at providing one. "
telegraph,9/3/2005 0:01,news,"The Prime Minister has said that Britain should grasp the huge opportunities for medicine presented by stem cell science but there were few details of how he plans to do this when the science budget was allocated earlier this week, save that £1 billion will be invested in biotechnology over the next three years.           While ministers spout more hot air than financial substance, a range of advances that will speed the development of human embryonic stem cell treatments have been announced by British scientists at an international conference in Edinburgh.           There is intense interest in using these cells, which can be coaxed to turn into any type - whether liver, blood or brain - for treating a vast range of ailments, from heart disease to Parkinson's. But, a few weeks ago, it was reported that America's approved bank of human embryonic stem cells is contaminated, because they are grown with the help of cells and factors from animals, and would probably trigger a hazardous immune response in patients.            The first human embryonic stem cell line where the risk of contamination has been cut was unveiled last weekend, at Stem Cell 2005, the first international meeting to discuss their therapeutic potential, by a team led by Dr Paul De Sousa at the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, including Prof Ian Wilmut, creator of Dolly the sheep,          Traditional culture - dish methods used to grow human embryonic stem cells – rely on animal-derived materials, notably foetal calf serum, which contains a complex mix of bovine proteins, and 'feeder cells' from mice, which are the source of contamination.          Unlike earlier work, in which animal serum products are used to remove the inner cells of the early embryo (those destined to become the embryo proper, from which stem cells are derived), the Roslin team, backed by the Geron Corporation, allowed the entire embryo to grow on a coating of human protein, laminin, isolated from human placentas. After a week in culture, human fibroblasts from neonatal foreskin were added to help the stem cells grow. The cells were nurtured with purified human proteins, such as growth factors.            'We have grown cells in a completely defined medium and environment with no direct exposure to animal cells or products,' said Dr De Sousa. 'To my knowledge, this is the first time this has been done. As such, we have significantly reduced the risk of exposure to unknown disease causing pathogens that may be present in animal cells or cell products.'           In a second development, backed by the Scottish Stem Cell Network, Prof Roger Pedersen and colleagues at the University of Cambridge have shown that a bank of just 150 lines of embryonic stem cells could provide sufficient tissue diversity to provide a good match for most people, after analysing data on 10,000 organ donors and 6,577 kidney patients. The study suggests that only 10 carefully selected lines of embryonic stem cells would be sufficient to meet the needs of 40 per cent of the population, with the aid of anti-rejection drugs.           Embryonic stem cell research has become mired in controversy, opposed by the Vatican and religious groups and banned in some countries while in America there is no federal funding for such work. Meanwhile, the pro-life movement has pointed to evidence that adult stem cells can 'transdifferentiate' and be turned into nerve, heart muscle and other types for repair, and claimed that this makes human embryo research redundant.          A speaker at the meeting, Prof Austin Smith of Edinburgh University's Institute of Stem Cell Research, said that although he supports continuing studies of adult stem cells, the claims that they could be transdifferentiated, notably from bone marrow to heart cells, were false.           In 2002, Prof Smith shocked the adult stem cell community by showing that adult stem cells do not turn into new tissue but fuse with existing cells, creating freak cells with double the dose of chromosomes - 80 instead of the usual 40 - and unknown health consequences. Subsequent studies have confirmed this finding, he said.           There have also been claims that adult stem cells from bone marrow - among a wide mixture of cells - can repair a heart, and success has even been reported in patients with heart disease. But Prof Smith said that it is unclear whether new blood vessels and heart muscle cells are arising from adult stem cells injected into a diseased heart. The benefits from these operations appear to arise from growth factors and other proteins exuded by the transplanted cells, which have stimulated repair.           This finding is 'exciting', since drugs could be developed to have the same effect, but is not technically a result of adult stem cell repair. And 'it is almost certainly not because injected cells turn into new heart'.           Not everyone in the stem cell community is so gloomy, however. Dr Jim McWhir of the Roslin Institute said, that, although some claims made on behalf of the potential of adult stem cells were exaggerated, 'not all were wrong'."
telegraph,6/3/2002 0:00,education,"   Controversial plans for an embryo cell bank, reported first in this newspaper, could give Britain a significant advantage, reports Roger Highfield      A UNIQUE bank will open next year to offer a select group of individuals the prospect of immortality. So long as the bank exists, their genetic identity will live on. Stranger still, all these individuals are human.This is one of the peculiar implications of Britain's plans to set up the world's first bank of cells from early human embryos. Medical researchers believe the bank will put us ahead of the rest of world in the race to develop new treatments for a broad spectrum of diseases. Equally, the plans are greeted with revulsion by 'pro-life' activists.There are thought to be around 37 lines of human embryo cells worldwide, of which a dozen are already of sufficient quality to freeze in the bank. The cells in question are 'stem cells' which have the potential to turn into any of the 200 different types in the body, offering huge potential to repair a patient who has been damaged by illness, accident or disease.Once warmed and grown at blood temperature in nutrients and growth factors, the stem cells will be initially used to find ways to reliably turn embryonic stem cells into the desired cell type.After the science is perfected, a single cell could fill freezers with ready-to-use immune, brain, heart or liver cells. Turning them into tissues and organs remains a distant prospect but these cells alone could revolutionise the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, stroke, spinal cord injuries, heart disease and diabetes.The immortal nature of the cells does, however, raise 'distinct problems' according to a House of Lords select committee on stem cells, which gave a qualified green light to embryo research last week.The Lords recommend that parents should be asked for permission that places no limits on how embryos are used, given that no one can imagine the potential applications. One team that has started to wrestle with these issues is based at the University of Sheffield. For the past three years, under the previous - tighter - regulations, professors Peter Andrews and Harry Moore have been taking surplus embryos from test-tube baby treatments and studying their stem cells to shed light on developmental problems. The alternative is to destroy these embryos.For their experiments, they need permission from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) and, most important, the fully-informed consent of the parents, who must waive any rights to treatments that may arise from the cells. 'The reaction of parents is amazingly positive,' said Prof Moore. 'The women who come forward for IVF treatment know that their treatment depended on research in the past. And a lot of those patients have family members or friends who could benefit from stem cells.'The embryo in question is smaller than the full stop at the end of this sentence. Just visible to the naked eye, it is a far cry from the popular image of an embryo, depicted as a comma, and certainly nothing like a foetus, which only begins to develop after the embryo implants in a woman's uterus.Given the technical name of a blastocyst, it consists of 100 cells: around 75 are destined to become the placenta, and the remainder, the 'inner cell mass', the embryo. The latter are the embryonic stem cells: they can turn into any cell from the body but, once removed from their sister cells, lack the crucial cues and signals to develop into a foetus.The cells of the inner cell mass, which exist for about seven days, have another curious property. They can expand without limit. One reason is that the telomeres - caps at the end of chromosomes - do not 'wear down' as in ordinary cells, though Prof Andrews thinks there is more to cellular immortality than that.Andrews and Moore were the first to start studying them in Britain, using a human embryonic stem cell line derived in 1998, after six years of trying, by a team at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.Now, with other groups, they are using surplus IVF embryos to create their own stem cell lines, the culmination of a 'long haul' that has involved legal, ethical and consent issues.The immortal nature of the cells is one key scientific issue. How do they differ from cancer cells, which can also multiply indefinitely? If a stem cell runs wild, a special type of cancer called a teratocarcinoma can result, a mixture of gut, muscle, nerves, teeth, tufts of hair - even grotesque facsimiles of fingers and legs.Prof Andrews, among others, studies teratocarcinomas to find out more about the origins of birth defects and the wider issue of how a stem cell can stay immortal without being cancerous, perhaps because they still respond to signals from surrounding cells.When the Sheffield team begins to derive lines of human stem cells, it will donate them to the national bank planned by the Medical Research Council (MRC), where ampoules of cells will be stored in liquid nitrogen. The location of the bank has yet to be decided: proposals have to be submitted by March 25.The bank is 'critical to breaking the current monopoly of private companies and to enable the best scientists in Europe to work on understanding these cells', said Prof Austin Smith, director of the Centre for Genome Research, University of Edinburgh, who is attempting to establish embryonic stem cell lines along with another team in London.The MRC also plans to obtain embryonic cells from other groups and companies, including one line imported from a 'reverse brain drainer' - Prof Roger Pedersen, who left the University of California, San Francisco, to work at Cambridge University.The repository should ensure that every embryo counts. 'We have got to do it properly. We cannot afford to get this wrong,' said Sir George Radda, MRC chief executive.Because UK regulations are the most liberal, Sir George expects the bank to mark a reverse brain drain of young talent to Britain, notably from America, where the research is under a cloud. 'We would certainly have a world lead,' said Sir George.Most of the embryos used to derive cells from the bank will be surplus IVF embryos, with those fertilised for the purpose, or created by cloning, requiring special justification. The bank will also include stem cells isolated from adults, which also show potential. 'It is important that there is research on both,' said Sir George, aware of how the pro-life lobby has argued that adult cells are an ethical alternative to embryonic stem cells.Use of the cells will be heavily regulated: in addition to the HFEA, there is the Medicines Control Agency, the Medical Devices Agency and owners of any patents on processes used to create the cell line.In parallel to efforts to reliably grow stem cells into brain, nerve, muscle or cells of any desired type there will be a shift towards growing embryonic cells under conditions of 'good manufacturing practice' so that they can be used to treat patients, either by matching the tissue with that of a recipient or by using drugs to prevent rejection.However, mindful of how gene therapy was oversold, Sir George stressed: 'This is not a short-term programme. The timescale is of the order of 10 years for the first sorts of applications.'While medical charities warmly welcome the move by the MRC, there is unease about the limits of embryo research. In recognition of these concerns, the council is to launch a public consultation exercise.Because of the opposition of pro-life groups, security will be among the many considerations taken into account when selecting the host laboratory. Some, such as Dr Robin Lovell-Badge, of the National Institute for Medical Research, London, are concerned by the reaction of those frustrated at losing the political and legal arguments over stem cell research.These fears were echoed by Prof Jack Scarisbrick, national chairman of the anti abortion group Life, who finds an embryonic stem cell bank a 'horrible, horrible' prospect. 'The more the courts turn us down, the more we are faced with stitch-ups like the select committee in the House of Lords, the more difficult it is to control the hot-heads.'"
dailymail,5/6/2015 18:33,sciencetech,"Amazon is in arace against Google to store data on human DNA.The web giants are competing for bragging rights in helping scientists make newmedical discoveries and market share in a business that may beworth $1 billion a year by 2018.It is hoped the online data will allows doctors to create personalised treatment plans. Academic institutions and healthcare companies are pickingsides between their cloud computing offerings - Google Genomicsor Amazon Web Services - spurring the two to one-up each otheras they win high-profile genomics business, according tointerviews with researchers, industry consultants andanalysts.That growth is being propelled by, among other forces, thepush for personalized medicine, which aims to base treatments ona patient's DNA profile. Making that a reality will requireenormous quantities of data to reveal how particular geneticprofiles respond to different treatments.Already, universities and drug manufacturers are embarkingon projects to sequence the genomes of hundreds of thousands ofpeople.The human genome is the full complement of DNA, or geneticmaterial, a copy of which is found in nearly every cell of thebody.Clients view Google and Amazon as doing a better job storinggenomics data than they can do using their own computers,keeping it secure, controlling costs and allowing it to beeasily shared.The cloud companies are going beyond storage to offeranalytical functions that let scientists make sense of DNA data. Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines are also competing for a slice of the market. The'cloud' refers to data or software that physically resides in aserver and is accessible via the internet, which allows users toaccess it without downloading it to their own computer.Now an estimated $100 million to $300 million businessglobally, the cloud genomics market is expected to grow to $1billion by 2018, said research analyst Daniel Ives of investmentbank FBR Capital. By that time, the entire cloud market shouldhave $50 billion to $75 billion in annual revenue, up from about$30 billion now.'The cloud is the entire future of this field,' CraigVenter, who led a private effort to sequence the human genome inthe 1990s, said in an interview. His new company, SanDiego-based Human Longevity Inc, recently tried to importgenomic data from servers at the J. Craig Venter Institute inRockville, Maryland.The transmission was so slow, scientists had to resort tosending disks and thumb drives by FedEx and human messengers, or'sneakernet,' he said. The company now uses Amazon Web Services.So does a collaboration between Regeneron PharmaceuticalsInc and Pennsylvania-based Geisinger Health Systems tosequence 250,000 genomes. Raw DNA data is uploaded to Amazon'scloud, where software from privately-held DNAnexus assembles themillions of chunks into the full, 3-billion-letter long genome.DNAnexus's algorithms then determine where an individualgenome differs from the 'reference' human genome, the company'schief scientist Dr. David Shaywitz said, in hopes of identifyingnew drug targets. Showing how important Google and Amazon view this business,and how they hope to use existing customers to lure future ones,each is hosting well-known genomics datasets for free.Other paying clients with a more specific focus are pickingsides.Google, for instance, won a project from the Autism Speaksfoundation to collect and analyze the genomes of 10,000 affectedchildren and their parents for clues to the genetic basis ofautism.Another customer is Tute Genomics, whose database of 8.5billion human DNA variants can be searched for how frequentlyany given variant appears, what traits it's associated with andhow people with a certain variant respond to particular drugs.Amazon is hosting the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation'sproject to collect complete-genome sequences and other data from1,000 patients to identify new drug targets. It also won theAlzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, which has similar aims.Amazon charges about $4 to $5 a month to store one fullhuman genome, and Google about $3 to $5 a month. The companiesalso charge for data transfers or computing time, as whenscientists run analytical software on stored data.Amazon's database-analysis tool, Redshift, costs 25 cents anhour or $1,000 per terabyte per year, the company said. Aterabyte is 1 trillion bytes, or 1,000 gigabytes, about enoughto hold 300 hours of high-quality video. Another part of the cloud services' pitch to would-becustomers is that their analytic tools can fish out genetic gold- a drug target, say, or a DNA variant that strongly predictsdisease risk - from a sea of data. Any discoveries made throughsuch searches belong to the owners of the data.'On the local university server it might take months to runa computationally-intense' analysis, said Alzheimer's projectleader Dr. Gerard Schellenberg of the University ofPennsylvania. 'On Amazon, it's, 'how fast do you need it done?',and they do it.'Another selling point is security.Universities are'generally pretty porous,' said Ryan Permeh, chief scientist atcybersecurity company Cylance Inc, of Irvine, California, andthe security of federal government computers is 'not at the topof the class.'While academic and pharmaceutical research projects are thebiggest customers for genomics cloud services, they will beovertaken by clinical applications in the next 10 years, saidGoogle Genomics director of engineering David Glazer.Individual doctors will regularly access a cloud service tounderstand how a patient's genetic profile affects his risk ofvarious diseases or his likely response to medication.'We are at that transition point now,' Glazer said.Matt Wood, general manager for Data Science at Amazon WebServices, sees cloud demand in genomics now as 'a perfectstorm,' as the amount of data being created, the need forcollaboration and the move of genomics into clinical careaccelerate.Experts on DNA and data say without access to the cloud,modern genomics would grind to a halt.Bioinformatics expert Dr. Atul Butte of the University ofCalifornia, San Francisco, said that now, when researchers atdifferent universities are jointly working on NIH and othergenomic data, they don't have to figure out how to make theircomputers talk to each other. In March, NIH cleared the way formajor research on the cloud when it began allowing scientists toupload important genomic data.'My response was, it's about time,' Butte said."
telegraph,17/08/2000 00:00,news,"   The Government will today release a long awaited report on therapeutic cloning, the most controversial issue in reproductive science. Roger Highfield reports on why experts believe that the benefits outweigh the ethical concerns  TO many people, this hollow ball of cells is a 'person', a 'tiny human being' who deserves the same rights as any other. To others, the ball deserves respect - but not as much as patients suffering disease or the ravages of old age. This is the human embryo at the heart of the row over whether scientists should be able to use 'therapeutic cloning' to fix a damaged body, the subject of a long awaited announcement today by the Government.Such embryos, left over from the creation of test-tube babies by in vitro fertilisation (IVF), are already used in studies. Now scientists want to clone embryos and extend the range of research they can conduct on them. To create the cloned embryo, a patient's cell would be fused with a human egg. After six days, the resulting embryo would be dismantled to yield special 'stem' cells that can be grown into any tissue needed to repair the patient.If it were placed in the womb, the embryo could even develop into a baby but there are no groups, scientific or religious, which support so called 'reproductive cloning', which is banned. The Government's dithering over whether to approve therapeutic cloning, recommended by an expert advisory group led by Prof Liam Donaldson, marks the latest twist in a debate over reproductive technologies that dates back to the birth of Louise Brown, the first 'test-tube baby', in 1978.The type of human embryo scientists hope to 'cannibalise' (as the critics put it) is shown here. A handful of scientists, such as Dr Austin Smith of the Centre for Genome Research, Edinburgh University, are already licensed to conduct research on them for strictly defined purposes.There are two issues for the Government to consider: whether to allow a wider range of research on stem cells taken from human embryos created in IVF programmes (Dr Smith only works on these embryos, which would otherwise be destroyed, with the owner's consent); and whether embryos should be cloned for research on the use of stem cells for therapies.The embryo in question is a far cry from the popular image, where it is depicted as a comma, and certainly nothing like a foetus, which only begins to develop after the embryo implants in a woman's uterus. This embryo consists of about 100 cells. Just visible to the naked eye, it is smaller than the full stop at the end of this sentence. It lacks a brain, heart or any recognisable feature (hence previous attempts by scientists to 'rebrand' it as a pre-embryo).Some scientists argue that it would be unethical, even cruel, to put the rights of this embryo above those of a patient. And they believe that most people feel the same way, citing a public consultation by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority two years ago. But the Government's foot dragging on this issue, and the decision to allow MPs a free vote on the subject this autumn, suggests that politicians remain nervous.Many people take 'potentiality' as their baseline for life: at the moment of fertilisation a potential person is born. Yet the potential of an egg fertilised in the lab is limited: it will not develop for more than a few days unless placed in the womb. And the concept of potentiality is too broad to be useful: all the cells in the body now have the potential to be unique individuals ever since the cloning of Dolly the sheep showed that any cell can be roped in to create a new individual.Fundamentalist opponents to therapeutic cloning often say that an embryo is sacred and to use it is tantamount to human sacrifice. Pragmatists point out that we live in an age of abortion, 'spare' IVF embryos are often destroyed, human life can be taken with justification in circumstances such as war, and the public regularly discusses capital punishment. Unlike a foetus, murderer or enemy soldier, this embryo is not sentient. No cruelty to it is therefore possible.The debate over the 'rights' of embryos versus the 'rights' of patients also neglects how research in reproductive technology can continue only with the co-operation of women. Indeed, if therapeutic cloning is allowed today, and even if all the scientists wanting to do it were the Nazi eugenicists that the critics fear, it could only happen with the approval of two people, the individual who was to be cloned and an egg donor.Some have argued that we should do more to attend to their feelings, since they are the people who would make therapeutic cloning possible. After all, this type of cloning extends only to the production of early embryos, not foetuses and certainly not babies. And the potentiated clusters of cells at the heart of the therapeutic cloning debate have no feelings at all.The technical name for a six-day-old embryo is a blastocyst, marking the stage of development when the embryo is ready to implant in the wall of the mother's womb. If, and only if, it is placed there, the cells on the outside will become the placenta, and the homogeneous cells towards the inside - the 'inner cell mass' - will grow into the embryo proper.The cells of the inner cell mass, which exist for about seven days, are the mothers of all foetal and adult cells. They are 'pluripotent', meaning they are blank sheets on which the genetic programming of human development has yet to draw in details.Once isolated in the laboratory, 'they can differentiate without limit and expand without limit', said Dr Smith. This can best be appreciated by comparing them with ordinary cells: the only way to make a liver cell grow beyond a pre-programmed limit of 50 or so cell divisions is to make it cancerous. Nor can an adult liver cell be turned into any other type, although scientists are studying whether this is possible to sidestep the need for cloning, since human eggs are so scarce.One point that is often missed is that these stem cells can be cultured from IVF embryos that would otherwise be discarded, commented Prof Peter Andrews of Sheffield University, who, with Prof Harry Moore, is studying one such line of stem cells derived in 1998, after six years of trying, by a team led by Prof James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.Once the science is perfected, a single IVF embryo could generate enough tissue to treat hundreds or thousands of patients, filling freezers with ready-to-use immune cells, neurons, heart or liver cells. Turning them into tissues and organs remains a distant prospect but these cells alone could revolutionise the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, stroke, spinal cord injuries, heart disease and diabetes.But these cells would have to be genetically altered, or used with drugs, if rejection were to be prevented. That is why making a cloned blastocyst is so attractive, because it would allow a patient to grow their own tissue, avoiding rejection problems.Dr Smith and Prof Andrews believe that it is anomalous that scientists are not allowed by current legislation to conduct research on stem cell isolation and therapeutic cloning, given the huge potential of embryonic stem cells to alleviate suffering. Critics, of course, see this as another step on a slippery slope to all kinds of horrors.But the rights and wrongs of embryo experimentation have been debated before, and in great detail, as a precursor to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (1990), which recognises that to ban all embryo research could result in incalculable suffering in the future. The Act only permits studies to boost understanding in specific areas: infertility; congenital disease or miscarriages; contraception; and methods to screen embryos for genetic defects.Experiments are only permitted up to a 14-day limit, or the appearance of the 'primitive streak', when the first glimmer of a nervous system - and thus consciousness - appears in the embryo. No scientist challenges the 14-day limit. Indeed, when a scientist fertilises a human egg with a sperm, it is difficult to grow the embryo beyond a week in the laboratory, let alone two: the low success rate of IVF and the abnormalities that often result from cloning show that the conditions used to nurture embryos are deficient.However, scientists do want to extend the research permitted by the Act to allow stem cell isolation and therapeutic cloning so they can study the development of the early human embryo (crucial for understanding birth defects), test the effects of drugs in pregnancy, and treat mitochondrial disease, which leads to metabolic disorders.Above all else, they hope that therapeutic cloning could allow a patient, whether a sufferer of Parkinson's, diabetes, heart failure or whatever, to grow cells for repair. At Monash University, Australia, Prof Alan Trounson has managed to isolate stem cells from cloned mouse embryos. And there is evidence from animal experiments that implanted embryonic stem cells can diversify to replace missing types and will migrate to where they are needed in the body.Before this is routine, much must be done. Scientists do not understand how to make a pluripotent cell turn into a desired tissue. They have to get this right, if these cells are to be safe to use. If a stem cell runs amok, a special type of cancer called a teratocarcinoma can result, a mixture of gut, muscle, nerves, teeth, tufts of hair - even grotesque facsimiles of fingers and legs. That is why Prof Andrews, among others, studies teratocarcinomas to find out more about stem cells and the origins of birth defects.Something like a teratocarcinoma grows when pluripotent cells are taken from a blastocyst and allowed to develop willy nilly. The result is called an embryoid body. However, it is 'nothing like an embryo', said Dr Smith. 'There is no organisation into a body plan, no skeleton or organs.'A way to turn stem cells into nerve cells has been found by Prof Thomson's team at Wisconsin, and Prof Trounson's team at Monash University, working with colleagues at the National University of Singapore and Hadassah Medical Centre. But there is a way to go before the process can be controlled to make any desired cells. 'The challenge to control differentiation is the last great challenge of developmental biology,' said Dr Smith. There is one last obstacle. Scientists are not entirely convinced that cells isolated by Profs Thomson and Trounson really are the elusive human embryonic stem cells, like those first isolated from mice in pioneering work by Prof Martin Evans, while in Cambridge.Uncertainty will remain because key experiments will never be performed for ethical reasons. For example, to prove mouse stem cells were truly normal, they were added to a blastocyst from a differently coloured mouse to make a chimera, a mouse that contained some patches from the stem cells and others from the blastocyst.There are also some practical differences, said Dr Smith: human stem cells lack a molecular switch, called Lif, that enables mouse cells to proliferate. As a result, human stem cells seem much more difficult to grow in the laboratory than mouse cells. Clearly there is much to be learnt about these cells before they could be used clinically.Prof Andrews has found various molecules on the surface of human cells that differ from those on the mouse, again underlining the need for studies on human embryos. 'We cannot always extrapolate from experimental animals like the mouse,' he said.There is also a long way to go before blastocysts can be cloned routinely. And even if research on these clones gets the green light, their use will be severely limited because human eggs are in such short supply. But the insights they will provide into disease, and how to treat it, will be vast.Many scientists also believe the prospect of routinely growing cloned embryos for patients is unlikely: research on therapeutic cloning will pave the way to clone-free methods that can wind back the developmental clock of a patient's cell to realise its full genetic potential. Ultimately, they hope, cells of any type could be regenerated from a speck of a patient's dandruff to carry out treatments and repair."
telegraph,25/03/2008 20:01,news,"            Here is the full text of the Prime Minster's letter to Labour MPs backing the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill                                                                Gordon Brown grants free vote on embryos                                             'I wanted to write to you to set out my reasons for supporting all the measures in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, and to clarify how we propose to handle it in Parliament.          The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill will update the legal framework which governs assisted reproduction and embryo research, bringing this into line with recent scientific developments and equalities legislation.          It will reform the regulatory framework in which embryo research is conducted, ensure that all human embryos outside the body are subject to the best regulation, create a ban on sex selection of offspring for non-medical reasons, and update the rules around entitlements to IVF.          Whilst many of these measures will not be controversial, the legislation will also provide the legal framework to support the continued development of stem cell research and clearly there are differing views on all sides of the house on this question.          Stem cell research is important because it makes it possible for this generation to contemplate new and effective treatments and cures for diseases that have afflicted mankind from time immemorial - from leukaemia and Alzheimer's to conditions affecting every family such as cancer and heart disease.          It was only in 1998 that James Thomson, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, successfully removed stem cells from spare embryos at fertility clinics in Madison. His discovery established the world's first human embryonic stem cell line and launched the science of stem cell research into the scientific mainstream.          Since then, work, particularly in the US and the UK, has demonstrated that embryonic stem cells have the potential to be used by medical science to generate replacement cells for a broad array of tissues and organs such as the heart, liver, pancreas and the nervous system.          The UK is at the forefront of this research and responsible for much of the worldwide progress. With adult stem cells already being used in treatments for conditions including leukaemia, severe combined immunodeficiency, and heart disease, scientists are already close to the breakthroughs that will allow embryonic stem cells to be used to treat a much wider range of conditions.          Medical researchers now believe that stem cell therapy has the potential to change dramatically the treatment of many other human afflictions: including not only Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's but perhaps also cancer, spinal cord injuries and muscle damage.          Stem cell research has always been controversial and I appreciate that there have always been those who have raised objections on religious or moral grounds as well of those of religious faith who have supported this type of work. I take these concerns seriously and respect the views of all those with religious convictions which they see as precluding this type of research.          I also see the profound opportunity in lives and quality of life which will be saved if we are able to answer objections and pursue the treatments and cures which will be available to us through this strand of medicine.          That is why we have - patiently and with full regard for religious concerns - sought to introduce progressively clear laws which permit the use of stem cells but which do so within a clear, managed legal framework, subject to the strictest supervision.          It is this approach which has ensured that Britain's support for research into stem cells has helped advance this science. It is not only in our own interest, but also the global interest that Britain should continue to play this role.          One major problem which stem cell researchers around the world now face is that embryonic stem cells are in short supply, and this is now limiting the pace of progress towards future cures and treatments which will save many lives.          That is why it is argued that the safest way to support our science is to make use of animal eggs from which animal genetic material has been extracted, and which can then be made compatible for research on human diseases by the inclusion of a human cell nucleus.          'Human admixed embryos', as they are known, are made by inserting human genetic material in the nucleus of an animal egg cell. If the embryo survives for a few days, stem cells may be collected and grown in culture.          These cells contain overwhelmingly human DNA. Permitting the use of these admixed embryos - which, it should again be emphasised, contain only minuscule amounts of animal DNA - will bring to an end the critical limiting factor in stem cell research: the limited availability of human eggs from which to create embryos.         The 1990 act is silent on the rules surrounding the use of these admixed embryos. Research on genetic conditions such as Alzheimer's has progressed on the basis of this approach in London and Newcastle with the support of the regulator, the HFEA, but both teams face uncertainty because of the lack of clarity in the rules.         The purpose of this 2008 Bill is to provide this clarity and a clear framework which supports stem cell research but provides boundaries.          Admixed embryos will be allowed only where they are used for clear scientific purposes and it will be illegal to keep them beyond 14 days. It will also be illegal to implant them into women or into any animals.          And so, in the next couple of months, legislation to create this framework and thus allow further progress in vital research will come before the House of Commons.          The legislation as a whole will be Government business at the second and third readings. However, respect for the religious beliefs of those who have fundamental concerns means we will have a free vote on the three new ethical issues on which the House has not previously taken a view: on whether admixed embryos are permitted within strict constraints; on the question of permitting 'saviour siblings' (who could, for example, donate blood) in the context of rare genetic conditions; and on changing the IVF requirements to require the need for supportive parenting to be taken into account.          I would like to take this opportunity to tell colleagues now that I will be voting in favour of these measures, including that to permit the use of admixed embryos which are, in my view, vital to the progression of stem cell research.          However, I fully respect the views of those who have specific religious objections.          I am also reassured that leading doctors and scientists do not believe they should operate in the absence of clear rules, but they believe that theirs is an inherently moral endeavour, that they can save and improve the lives of thousands and over time millions of people, and that they can combine this work with a deep commitment to the highest ethical standards and a sincere respect for religious beliefs.'

telegraph,21/01/2007 00:01,finance,"            Sylvia Pfeifer looks at why business and genetics are not always a natural pairing                  Remember Dolly the sheep? The world's first cloned mammal was heralded as a scientific breakthrough and helped establish Britain's reputation as home to a thriving biotechnology industry. Today, 10 years after she was created, Dolly is stuffed and on display at the Royal Museum in Edinburgh.          Although Dolly was mainly a scientific sensation, it was also a story about business. At the height of Dolly's fame, shares in PPL Therapeutics, the Scottish company that created her, were worth more than 450p. The company eventually collapsed in 2004, its cutting-edge expertise sold to an American group.          A decade after Dolly was created, British geneticists are once again making headlines: this time, with the creation of a breed of genetically modified hens that can produce cancer-fighting medicines in their eggs. The 500-strong flock was bred at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, the birthplace of Dolly. Scientists believe the breakthrough could lead to treatments for Parkinson's disease, diabetes and a range of cancers.           Just as investors piled into PPL, there will be others keen to take a punt on those companies that follow in its footsteps. But can breakthrough research ever generate breakthrough returns for investors? Simon Best, the chairman of the BioIndustry Association, is among those who are adamant that the two can go hand in hand. What investors need to accept, he argues, is the time it takes to get a commercial product to the market. 'There is always going to be a huge time lag between cutting-edge research and the commercial product. At the beginning of the biotech industry, people thought it would dramatically alter the time horizons, but it didn't,' he says.          The other factor is cost. Even those that run the companies active in new areas of research such as gene therapy or stem cells concede you will always need more capital than you initially thought. 'If you do cutting-edge anything, because it's such a step into the unknown, there will always be a huge attrition of funds,' says Nigel Parker, the chief executive of Ark Therapeutics, which is working on a gene-based brain cancer medicine.          Michael Hunt, his counterpart at ReNeuron, which is working on treatments for brain damage caused by strokes and Alzheimer's disease using stem cells, is even more categoric about the risks. 'How is the value created in cutting-edge science?' he asks. 'With very great difficulty. It is high-risk, high-return. In the stem cell field, it applies to more than most.'          Hunt knows what he is talking about. The company initially floated in November 2000 with a valuation of £65m. The shares subsequently collapsed after it discovered that its manufacturing process created unstable stem cells that divided too often and became impossible to control. Its private equity backer, Merlin Biosciences, run by Sir Christopher Evans, eventually took it private for just £3.6m in April 2003 – less than the £5m-£6m cash ReNeuron still had on its balance sheet.          Two years later, the company returned to the public markets. But even in the intervening two years, it has not all been plain sailing. Earlier this month, ReNeuron's shares lost a fifth of their value to 36.5p after the US medicines regulator, the US Food and Drug Administration, placed the company's application to conduct clinical trials of its stroke treatment on hold. The shares have since ticked up to close at 42.5p on Friday.          Hunt is sanguine about the decision, arguing that it is part and parcel of being a company operating within a new area. 'The FDA decision was not unexpected,' he says. 'There is no precedent for what we are doing. Ultimately, we believe we will get there, delivering cell therapy products to patients.'          If there is one rule for investors in these companies, it is that there are no rules.          Even Merlin, one of the industry's leading venture capital investors, has not always backed the right horse. But while it may still be waiting to hit the big time with ReNeuron, other investments, such as the one in Ark, have already paid dividends.          Earlier this month, the company announced that its potentially life-saving treatment for brain tumours, Cerepro, may be given early approval to be put on the market in Europe by March. Trials of Cerepro so far have shown one dose can give a patient with malignant brain cancer an extra seven and a half months of good quality life. Those with the condition normally have eight to nine mainly painful months to live.          But while a venture capital investor like Merlin can afford to wait up to 10 years before seeing a return on investments, the time horizons of institutional investors are traditionally much shorter. Nevertheless, there are some that do decide to take the plunge. Just before Christmas, for example, Fidelity, the blue-chip fund manager, took just under a 4 per cent stake in Ark.          One of the reasons gene therapy companies such as Ark and Oxford BioMedica, which is developing a gene therapy drug against renal cancer, are exciting both scientists and investors is that many believe gene therapy could be the next technological platform after monoclonal antibodies to produce commercial products.          Erling Refsum, director at merchant bank Mulier Capital, says: 'Since Crick and Watson discovered DNA, it has been all about what the blueprint does. Up to now, we've been trying to produce chemicals that block or mimic the chemicals that genes make. The next stage will be medicines that turn genes on or off.'          'New technologies generally take 30 years to be a big commercial success. We're getting into that time period now for gene therapy,' he adds.          Other technologies, such as stem cells or indeed pharming – which involves the use of animals that have been genetically modified to produce human proteins in their milk – will take longer to deliver commercial successes. Pharming, for example, the Netherlands-based company, produces therapeutic proteins derived from the milk of transgenic animals.          For stem cells, the current issues are twofold, says David Macauley, the chief executive of the UK Stem Cell Foundation: intellectual property and the business model. There has been a huge escalation in patenting around the world, raising concerns about the freedom to operate. Second, there is a great uncertainty regarding the product and its delivery.          Professor Alan Kingsman, the CEO of Oxford BioMedica, raises the same problems.          'The big issue is: there isn't a product, it's more a service. It's a very different thing from a pharmaceutical in a bottle,' he says.          What the Government needs to do is take a more hands-on approach and create the regulatory context that will promote investment into the area, argues Macauley.          'The UK leads the world in terms of capability in stem cells, but we're probably the least equipped to exploit that, thanks to things like risk aversion and the structure of our financial markets,' he says. 'Once we've got proof of principle, I think the commercial money will flow.'          So what lessons have people drawn from the short life of Dolly? If there is one, it is that scientists need to think about what technologies are going to find a market and which aren't.          'The problem with the whole transgenic animal was that scientifically, it was an interesting idea, but from a real-world perspective, there was not a lot of demand for it,' says Kingsman.          That is, at least, not yet."
telegraph,30/01/2006 00:01,news,"By Alasdair Palmer Stem cell therapy holds the promise of being the ultimate cure for everything that can go wrong with the body. The hope is that one day, it will be possible to use stem cells to regrow and replace any diseased or failing organ. From Alzheimer's Disease to Parkinson's, from heart attacks to muscle or brain collapse - stem cells could, theoretically, be used to cure them all.           Achieving the holy grail of medicine in practice is, however, enormously difficult. Scientists the world over are trying to unlock the secrets of stem cells. None has so far succeeded. Hwang Woo-suk, the Korean who claimed to have taken an important first step by cloning human cells, turned out to be a fraud.           That, however, has not stopped people from offering treatments based on the power of stem cells. Those who have had the treatments now available - and you can buy them for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as multiple sclerosis (MS) - report differing degrees of success.            The buzz around stem cell therapy for MS is the loudest and most exciting. In recent months, several people with MS reported that they had improved dramatically after being treated with an experimental stem cell therapy. Treatment for MS is something in which I have a personal interest. I was diagnosed with the disease nearly 14 years ago.           MS is thought to be caused by the body's immune system mistakenly attacking the fatty covering of nerves in the spinal cord and destroying them. Without that covering, known as myelin, the nerves cannot transmit messages from the brain to other parts of the body effectively.          The nerves themselves become damaged - which is what leads to progressive and irreversible paralysis which characterises the disease. The hope for treating MS is that stem cells would be able to repair and rebuild the damaged parts of the spinal cord. That would mean something which every person with MS desperately wants but cannot get: a cure.           Jan Wilks was diagnosed with primary progressive MS in 2003. She was declining very swiftly. 'I got terrible back and head aches. I couldn't walk and I had to use a wheelchair. I lost control of my bladder. Worst of all, I was losing all hope,' she says.          Her husband, Paul, tracked down ACT, the company which offers stem cell treatments for a range of conditions, including MS. ACT suggested he talk to people who had already visited the clinic. 'I spoke to about 50 people as a result,' Mr Wilks says. 'They were nearly all very enthusiastic about the treatment, insisting that it had transformed their lives. The only person who wasn't was a Scotsman. He said the treatment was a waste of money and he wanted to sue the company.'           The couple decided to go for it. 'For the first time since I was diagnosed,' remembers Mrs Wilks, 'I felt there was hope. You need hope to live.'          The first problem they faced was raising the money. 'ACT charges around £12,000 for it,' she says. 'When Paul told me about it, he said, 'Well, we'll just have to remortage the house or sell it'.'            Mrs Wilks, who worked, and still works, as a checkout clerk at Asda in Liverpool, told her co-workers about what she wanted to do and how she needed £12,000. 'And they were amazing. They organised a charity night for me. My boss let us put buckets for collecting money at every checkout. When I saw customers putting money in, I felt so moved and grateful I practically started crying. I thought: if you knew what that meant to me.'          With their help, Mrs Wilks and her colleagues raised the £12,000 in four months. 'There was an article in the local paper: KLM, the Dutch airline, saw it, and donated seats on a flight to Amsterdam for me and Paul.'           A week before they were due to fly to Holland, they had an appointment with Mrs Wilks's regular NHS neurologist. He was sceptical of the treatment. 'He told us just to be cautious. 'It's a lot of money,' he said, 'and there's not much evidence that it will work.' I said to him, 'But what are you going to do for me if I don't go?' His only reply was 'Well, there's nothing really that I can do.' That's the reason why I had to go. He had nothing. I had to try to do something. Something is better than nothing. And to be fair to him, he understood that. He wasn't against my going.'          The treatment in Rotterdam in July last year was very rapid. 'You get this vial of stem cells,' says Mrs Wilks, who is in her mid-forties. 'They come from umbilical cords, which would otherwise be thrown away. The mothers have to give permission for them to be used. They and their babies are checked that they don't have any health problems.          They come frozen and you have to warm them with your hand. You then get one lot of stem cells via a drip - it takes about 20 minutes - and one in an injection just under the skin. The doctor did mine in my back. The weird thing was I felt better almost immediately. My headache and back pain just went.          'Over the past six months,' Mrs Wilks says, 'I have steadily improved. My bladder problems have cleared up completely. I can stand up and walk. I can play with the children. The wheelchair is now gathering mothballs. It's great!' Her right leg is still stiff, but she can walk without a stick - although she prefers to use one 'for reassurance'. 'Compared to what she was,' says her husband, 'she's amazing. That right leg didn't used to be just stiff. It was dead. She was dragging it around.'           It is, of course, impossible for an outsider to judge whether the improvement has been as spectacular as the couple believe. ACT did not assess Mrs Wilks's mobility before the treatment. The company did not give her an MRI scan to assess what damage there was to her brain and spinal cord. It has not followed the case up either. 'They leave you pretty much to yourself,' she says. 'We had a call to say we should get in touch if I had any problems but they haven't come to assess me.'          ACT has, however, offered a 'top-up' stem cell treatment to Mrs Wilks. 'They said the publicity they had got from my case meant they had been inundated with people who wanted the treatment, and so they wanted to give me a top-up free. I'm going to go for that in the next month. If it has an effect on further loosening up my right leg, that will be wonderful.'           Most scientists who are researching MS and stem cell treatments are doubtful about ACT's treatment. 'It is not impossible that ACT have hit upon something which works,' explains my doctor at the Hospital for Neurology at Queen Square, London. 'But it isn't very likely, and if ACT have got something that works, it is by accident, not because of the research they have done. ACT's medical director, for instance, hasn't published any scientific papers. The fact that they do not follow up their patients sends off alarm bells. It's absolutely the most elementary step to take in any piece of scientific research: without it, you simply can't establish whether what you have done has had the effect that you aimed at. The failure to follow up patients makes it seem as if ACT's primary concern isn't their patients' health: it is collecting their money.'           Although stem cells could in principle repair damage - studies in mice have had some promising results, with the stem cells seemingly able to 'home in' on the location of damaged nerve cells and reconstruct them - there are real risks. Introducing stem cells, particularly when they come not from the patients themselves, but from another source such as an umbilical cord, could have unpredictable and very unpleasant consequences.          There is no control over the way the new cells divide. They could transform themselves into tumours - cancerous cells - with fatal results. While that is not, of course, certain, it is a theoretical possibility, one which is at least as real as the possibility that stem cells will provide a permanent cure for MS.           No one knows whether ACT's stem cell treatment is safe and effective. That is why I personally would not pay £12,000 for the treatment - at least not yet. Many doctors in Britain think it is deeply irresponsible for any company to offer or recommend it before there have been any serious studies, or indeed any studies at all, which establish that the treatment does more good than harm.          Unexpected side effects occur very often with new drugs. For instance, a drug for reducing acute episodes of MS, which is twice as effective as the existing drugs, was discovered to have a small risk of a catastrophic event: three of the 5,000 people who participated in the trial developed an irreversible and fatal brain disease.           Over the years, there have been dozens of 'miracle cures' for MS. When subjected to rigorous trials, all of them have been found to be no more effective than a placebo. For instance, a trial for 'goat serum', which was being trumpeted as the first effective treatment, was abandoned recently when it was shown to have no effect at all.           But that is not going to put off thousands of people suffering from MS from hoping that ACT's stem cell therapy is the answer. 'What is the alternative?' asks Mrs Wilks. 'I'll tell you what it is.

dailymail,13/05/2015 18:43,sciencetech,"It is not quite the fountain of eternal youth, but researchers have found a drug they say can rejuvenate ageing brain and muscle tissue.The small-molecule drug simultaneously perks up old stem cells in the brains and muscles of mice.The scientists hope the drug could lead to a treatments for old age, making ageing tissues throughout the body act young again.Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, found a a small-molecule drug simultaneously perks up old stem cells in the brains and muscles of mice, a finding that could lead to drug interventions for humans that would make tissues throughout the body act young again.'We established that you can use a single small molecule to rescue essential function in not only aged brain tissue but aged muscle,' said David Schaffer.'That is good news, because if every tissue had a different molecular mechanism for ageing, we wouldn't be able to have a single intervention that rescues the function of multiple tissues.'The drug interferes with the activity of a growth factor, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1), that Schaffer's UC Berkeley colleague Irina Conboy showed over the past 10 years depresses the ability of various types of stem cells to renew tissue.'Based on our earlier papers, the TGF-beta1 pathway seemed to be one of the main culprits in multi-tissue aging,' said Conboy, an associate professor of bioengineering.'That one protein, when upregulated, ages multiple stem cells in distinct organs, such as the brain, pancreas, heart and muscle. 'This is really the first demonstration that we can find a drug that makes the key TGF-beta1 pathway, which is elevated by ageing, behave younger, thereby rejuvenating multiple organ systems.'The UC Berkeley team reported its results in the current issue of the journal Oncotarget.Aging is ascribed, in part, to the failure of adult stem cells to generate replacements for damaged cells and thus repair the body's tissues. Researchers have shown that this decreased stem cell activity is largely a result of inhibitory chemicals in the environment around the stem cell, some of them dumped there by the immune system as a result of chronic, low-level inflammation that is also a hallmark of aging.In 2005, Conboy and her colleagues infused old mice with blood from young mice - a process called parabiosis - reinvigorating stem cells in the muscle, liver and brain/hippocampus and showing that the chemicals in young blood can actually rejuvenate the chemical environment of aging stem cells.Last year, doctors began a small trial to determine whether blood plasma from young people can help reverse brain damage in elderly Alzheimer's patients.Such therapies are impractical if not dangerous, however, so Conboy, Schaffer and others are trying to track down the specific chemicals that can be used safely and sustainably for maintaining the youthful environment for stem cells in many organs. One key chemical target for the multi-tissue rejuvenation is TGF-beta1, which tends to increase with age in all tissues of the body and which Conboy showed depresses stem cell activity when present at high levels.Five years ago, Schaffer, who studies neural stem cells in the brain, teamed up with Conboy to look at TGF-beta1 activity in the hippocampus, an area of the brain important in memory and learning. Among the hallmarks of aging are a decline in learning, cognition and memory. In the new study, they showed that in old mice, the hippocampus has increased levels of TGF-beta1 similar to the levels in the bloodstream and other old tissue.Using a viral vector that Schaffer developed for gene therapy, the team inserted genetic blockers into the brains of old mice to knock down TGF-beta1 activity, and found that hippocampal stem cells began to act more youthful, generating new nerve cells.The team then injected into the blood a chemical known to block the TGF-beta1 receptor and thus reduce the effect of TGF-beta1. This small molecule, an Alk5 kinase inhibitor already undergoing trials as an anticancer agent, successfully renewed stem cell function in both brain and muscle tissue of the same old animal, potentially making it stronger and more clever, Conboy said.'The key TGF-beta1 regulatory pathway became reset to its young signaling levels, which also reduced tissue inflammation, hence promoting a more favorable environment for stem cell signaling,' she said. 'You can simultaneously improve tissue repair and maintenance repair in completely different organs, muscle and brain.'The researchers noted that this is only a first step toward a therapy, since other biochemical cues also regulate adult stem cell activity. Schaffer and Conboy's research groups are now collaborating on a multi-pronged approach in which modulation of two key biochemical regulators might lead to safe restoration of stem cell responses in multiple aged and pathological tissues.'The challenge ahead is to carefully retune the various signaling pathways in the stem cell environment, using a small number of chemicals, so that we end up recalibrating the environment to be youth-like,' Conboy said. 'Dosage is going to be the key to rejuvenating the stem cell environment.' "
telegraph,30/08/2013 13:33,news,"Mini human brains have become the latest body part to be grown from stem cells in the laboratory. Does this mean the age of regenerative medicine has arrived? The concept of growing spare body parts in test tubes has long featured in   science fiction, but research using stem cells is now allowing real organs   and tissues to be created in laboratories. This is part of a fast moving field known as regenerative medicine, which   promises to provide patients with a catalogue of spare parts to repair and   replace damaged or diseased bits of the body. Already a number of tissues have been successfully created, but most have yet   to be tested in the clinic. So could growing human organs in the laboratory lead to the ability to renew   parts of our bodies, or does their value lie elsewhere? TracheaA lab-grown windpipe, created from stem cells that were grown on a scaffold,   is the only rudimentary organ to have been successfully transplanted into a   patient. Stem cells taken from the patient’s bone marrow were implanted onto a scaffold   that was created by striping a donated trachea of its cells. The three inch long segment of windpipe was then transplanted into Claudia   Castillo, who had suffered damage to her own trachea following a rare form   of tuberculosis. A two year old girl called Hannah Warren who received a windpipe transplant   made from plastic fibres and her own stem cells sadly died three months   after her operation. However, replacing relatively simple structures like the trachea remains the   most promising form of regenerative medicine at the moment. BonesImagine being able to repair a broken bone, or even better replace smashed   bones entirely. A number of research groups around the world are developing techniques to grow   human bones from stem cells in the laboratory. Israeli biotechnology company Bonus BioGroup use three dimensional scans to   build a gel-like scaffold of a bone before seeding it with stem cells taken   from fat. They then developed   into bone. They have already transplanted the bones into animals.  Dr Shai Meretzki, chief executive of Bonus BioGroup, with the human   bones grown from stem cellsA team at Keele University led by Professor Alicia El Haj are also working on   technology to mend broken bones. They have developed an injectable gel containing stem cells that have tiny   magnetic particles attached to their surface. By stimulating the area with a magnetic field, they can replicate the   mechanical force that would normally be generated by walking around, which   allows the bones to grow denser. They hope to start trials in patients within the next five years. LiverThere is currently no way to compensate for the loss of liver function, which   plays an important role in metabolising drugs and removing harmful toxins   from the blood stream. Liver failure patients must rely upon waiting for a transplant and many die   before receiving one. However, tiny   functioning human livers have been grown in the laboratory by Japanese   researchers. They announced earlier this year that these tiny organs, known as liver buds,   were able to connect to the blood supply and function when transplanted in   to mice.  Tiny livers grown from stem cells could repair damaged organs CREDIT:   Takanori Takebe/PA While they are still some way from growing a fully formed human liver, the   scientists believe transplanting thousands of these liver buds into patients   with liver failure could help restore the function of their own organs. However, scientists warn it could be sometime before stem cell using lab grown   liver buds could be applied to patients. KidneyAnother crucial organ that once damaged cannot be easily replaced or repaired.   Patients must rely upon dialysis treatment to filter the blood in their body   instead. Transplants are often in short supply and can be rejected by the recipient’s   body, so using a patient’s own stem cells to grow a new one would be highly   desirable. In April, scientists reported that they had grown a kidney in the laboratory –   making it one of the most complex organs to have been created. They stripped an old rat kidney of its cells to leave a tangled web of   proteins and blood vessels as a scaffold. They then pumped kidney and blood   vessel cells through the scaffold and incubated it. The resulting organ looked more like a sack of pink goo than a kidney, but   when they were tested they produced urine at a rate of 23% of natural   kidneys. These were then transplanted into rates. However, the transplanted kidneys were far less effective, only operating at   5% of natural organs. Another major hurdle is repeating this process with human cells and on   something as large as a human kidney. However, these lab grown organs could provide a more accurate model for   testing new drugs and treatments in the laboratory before they are given to   human patients. HeartA similar technique to the one above was used in 2008 to grow whole beating   hearts. An old heart was stripped of its cells to leave a collagen structure   behind. This was then repopulated with heart muscle cells. Earlier this year scientists reported they had produced beating heart tissue   from stem cells. Scientists at the University of Pittsburgh earlier this month announced they   had created a   beating mouse heart after rebuilding it with human stem cells. These stem cells had been generated from human skin and “reset” to behave like   embryonic stem cells, a type of cell that can grow into any other kind found   in the body. The scientists believe they could use a similar technique to create human   heart tissue that can be used in drug testing or for grafts to repair   damaged areas. Scaling up this system to replace an entire human heart, however, will remain   a major challenge. Many researchers see more value in using beating human heart tissue in the   laboratory as a tool for studying heart disease and as a way of safely   testing new treatments. BladderThis was probably the first organ to be grown in the laboratory and   transplanted into patients. Essentially a hollow balloon, scientists at Wake   Forest University in North Carolina grew new bladders from bladder cells   taken from patients. They seeded the cells onto a scaffold and grew them for seven weeks before   surgically attaching the new bladders to the old bladders of seven patients   in 2006. In 2010 researchers revealed they had been able to grow bladders using stem   cells taken from a patients own bone marrow. BrainThe most recent development saw human stem cells derived from skin develop   into brain tissue. The researchers, from Institute of Molecular Biotechnology in Austria, created   complex three dimensional brain tissue they described as “mini brains”. They were found to survive for at least 10 months while kept in a bioreactor   that supplied them with nutrients. However, the main use for these will be to study neurological diseases and   test the effects of new drugs on the brain. It seems unlikely that anyone will seek to transplant an entire brain as   without the learning and development that comes from the neurological connections   that form over years of life experience, the new brains would be essentially   infantile. They would carry none of the memories nor necessarily have the same ability to   control the body. This seems like the most far fetched possibility for a lab   grown replacement organ. But again, these lab grown organs could have far more value in allowing   scientists to study neurological conditions like Alzheimer's Disease,   potentially opening up new ways of treating and diagnosing the illness. Pituitary glandThis tiny hormone-secreting organ is found at the base of the brain but can   malfunction in some people, leading to a range of growth related diseases. Japanese scientists have grown tiny pituitary glands in the laboratory from   stem cells taken from a mouse embryo. When these were transplanted into mice with pituitary gland defects, it raised   levels of hormones in the animal's bodies. The researchers are now working on using human stem cells to create pituitary   tissue. EyesProbably one of the most complex organs in the human body, hopes of growing a   whole human eye are still rather beyond the realms of possibility. However, researchers have shown they can grow the light sensitive tissue at   the back of the eye, known as the retina. Last year, scientists in Japan grew a structure known as the optic cup – a   precursor of a human eye. Measuring just half a millimetre, it contained multiple layers of retinal   cells including photoreceptors. In the experiment, precursor retinal cells spontaneously formed a ball of   tissue that bulged outwards to form a bubble called an eye vesicle. This structure then folded pack on itself to form a pouch, creating the optic   cup with an outer wall with a lining of retinal cells. "
telegraph,29/01/2006 00:01,news,"Stem cell therapy holds the promise of being the ultimate cure for everything that can go wrong with the body. The hope is that one day, it will be possible to use stem cells to regrow and replace any diseased or failing organ. From Alzheimer's Disease to Parkinson's, from heart attacks to muscle or brain collapse - stem cells could, theoretically, be used to cure them all.                                         Achieving the holy grail of medicine in practice is, however, enormously difficult. Scientists the world over are trying to unlock the secrets of stem cells. None has so far succeeded. Hwang Woo-suk, the Korean who claimed to have taken an important first step by cloning human cells, turned out to be a fraud.           That, however, has not stopped people from offering treatments based on the power of stem cells. Those who have had the treatments now available - and you can buy them for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as multiple sclerosis (MS) - report differing degrees of success.            The buzz around stem cell therapy for MS is the loudest and most exciting. In recent months, several people with MS reported that they had improved dramatically after being treated with an experimental stem cell therapy. Treatment for MS is something in which I have a personal interest. I was diagnosed with the disease nearly 14 years ago.           MS is thought to be caused by the body's immune system mistakenly attacking the fatty covering of nerves in the spinal cord and destroying them. Without that covering, known as myelin, the nerves cannot transmit messages from the brain to other parts of the body effectively.          The nerves themselves become damaged - which is what leads to progressive and irreversible paralysis which characterises the disease. The hope for treating MS is that stem cells would be able to repair and rebuild the damaged parts of the spinal cord. That would mean something which every person with MS desperately wants but cannot get: a cure.           Jan Wilks was diagnosed with primary progressive MS in 2003. She was declining very swiftly. 'I got terrible back and head aches. I couldn't walk and I had to use a wheelchair. I lost control of my bladder. Worst of all, I was losing all hope,' she says.          Her husband, Paul, tracked down ACT, the company which offers stem cell treatments for a range of conditions, including MS. ACT suggested he talk to people who had already visited the clinic. 'I spoke to about 50 people as a result,' Mr Wilks says. 'They were nearly all very enthusiastic about the treatment, insisting that it had transformed their lives. The only person who wasn't was a Scotsman. He said the treatment was a waste of money and he wanted to sue the company.'           The couple decided to go for it. 'For the first time since I was diagnosed,' remembers Mrs Wilks, 'I felt there was hope. You need hope to live.'          The first problem they faced was raising the money. 'ACT charges around £12,000 for it,' she says. 'When Paul told me about it, he said, 'Well, we'll just have to remortage the house or sell it'.'            Mrs Wilks, who worked, and still works, as a checkout clerk at Asda in Liverpool, told her co-workers about what she wanted to do and how she needed £12,000. 'And they were amazing. They organised a charity night for me. My boss let us put buckets for collecting money at every checkout. When I saw customers putting money in, I felt so moved and grateful I practically started crying. I thought: if you knew what that meant to me.'          With their help, Mrs Wilks and her colleagues raised the £12,000 in four months. 'There was an article in the local paper: KLM, the Dutch airline, saw it, and donated seats on a flight to Amsterdam for me and Paul.'           A week before they were due to fly to Holland, they had an appointment with Mrs Wilks's regular NHS neurologist. He was sceptical of the treatment. 'He told us just to be cautious. 'It's a lot of money,' he said, 'and there's not much evidence that it will work.' I said to him, 'But what are you going to do for me if I don't go?' His only reply was 'Well, there's nothing really that I can do.' That's the reason why I had to go. He had nothing. I had to try to do something. Something is better than nothing. And to be fair to him, he understood that. He wasn't against my going.'          The treatment in Rotterdam in July last year was very rapid. 'You get this vial of stem cells,' says Mrs Wilks, who is in her mid-forties. 'They come from umbilical cords, which would otherwise be thrown away. The mothers have to give permission for them to be used. They and their babies are checked that they don't have any health problems.          They come frozen and you have to warm them with your hand. You then get one lot of stem cells via a drip - it takes about 20 minutes - and one in an injection just under the skin. The doctor did mine in my back. The weird thing was I felt better almost immediately. My headache and back pain just went.          'Over the past six months,' Mrs Wilks says, 'I have steadily improved. My bladder problems have cleared up completely. I can stand up and walk. I can play with the children. The wheelchair is now gathering mothballs. It's great!' Her right leg is still stiff, but she can walk without a stick - although she prefers to use one 'for reassurance'. 'Compared to what she was,' says her husband, 'she's amazing. That right leg didn't used to be just stiff. It was dead. She was dragging it around.'           It is, of course, impossible for an outsider to judge whether the improvement has been as spectacular as the couple believe. ACT did not assess Mrs Wilks's mobility before the treatment. The company did not give her an MRI scan to assess what damage there was to her brain and spinal cord. It has not followed the case up either. 'They leave you pretty much to yourself,' she says. 'We had a call to say we should get in touch if I had any problems but they haven't come to assess me.'          ACT has, however, offered a 'top-up' stem cell treatment to Mrs Wilks. 'They said the publicity they had got from my case meant they had been inundated with people who wanted the treatment, and so they wanted to give me a top-up free. I'm going to go for that in the next month. If it has an effect on further loosening up my right leg, that will be wonderful.'           Most scientists who are researching MS and stem cell treatments are doubtful about ACT's treatment. 'It is not impossible that ACT have hit upon something which works,' explains my doctor at the Hospital for Neurology at Queen Square, London. 'But it isn't very likely, and if ACT have got something that works, it is by accident, not because of the research they have done. ACT's medical director, for instance, hasn't published any scientific papers. The fact that they do not follow up their patients sends off alarm bells. It's absolutely the most elementary step to take in any piece of scientific research: without it, you simply can't establish whether what you have done has had the effect that you aimed at. The failure to follow up patients makes it seem as if ACT's primary concern isn't their patients' health: it is collecting their money.'           Although stem cells could in principle repair damage - studies in mice have had some promising results, with the stem cells seemingly able to 'home in' on the location of damaged nerve cells and reconstruct them - there are real risks. Introducing stem cells, particularly when they come not from the patients themselves, but from another source such as an umbilical cord, could have unpredictable and very unpleasant consequences.          There is no control over the way the new cells divide. They could transform themselves into tumours - cancerous cells - with fatal results. While that is not, of course, certain, it is a theoretical possibility, one which is at least as real as the possibility that stem cells will provide a permanent cure for MS.           No one knows whether ACT's stem cell treatment is safe and effective. That is why I personally would not pay £12,000 for the treatment - at least not yet. Many doctors in Britain think it is deeply irresponsible for any company to offer or recommend it before there have been any serious studies, or indeed any studies at all, which establish that the treatment does more good than harm.          Unexpected side effects occur very often with new drugs. For instance, a drug for reducing acute episodes of MS, which is twice as effective as the existing drugs, was discovered to have a small risk of a catastrophic event: three of the 5,000 people who participated in the trial developed an irreversible and fatal brain disease.           Over the years, there have been dozens of 'miracle cures' for MS. When subjected to rigorous trials, all of them have been found to be no more effective than a placebo. For instance, a trial for 'goat serum', which was being trumpeted as the first effective treatment, was abandoned recently when it was shown to have no effect at all.           But that is not going to put off thousands of people suffering from MS from hoping that ACT's stem cell therapy is the answer. 'What is the alternative?' asks Mrs Wilks. 'I'll tell you what it is. It's waiting and watching as you get worse and worse. I feel so much better since I had the stem cells. If there are problems later, I'll deal with them when they arise. I don't know what the science behind the stem cell treatment is - and to tell you the truth, I don't care. I couldn't wait for certainty. I needed the treatment now.'

telegraph,6/12/2004 0:01,comment,"The revelation that a paralysed woman has recovered some movement after a riding accident, through the transplant of stem cells from her nose to her spine, is wonderful news. But it is by no means the first example of the beneficial use of adult stem cells.          Kim Gould is the first British patient in a pioneering trial in a Lisbon hospital, but the use of stem cells in operations is old hat. Bone marrow transplants - now routine in British hospitals - are in essence stem cell transplants, in that the cells involved satisfy the definition of stem cells; ie they last a lifetime and are able to regenerate nerve tissue.          All the same, the ability of Mrs Gould to crawl and regain some movement and sensation shows the great - and growing - healing potential of stem cells. That the cells in question came from Mrs Gould's own nose and not from an embryo will also help to set in stone the exact nature of stem cells. Many people have come to the mistaken conclusion that stem cells are by their very nature bad, because, so they wrongly think, all stem cells are harvested from embryos.           The true distinction to make is between adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells. And it is over this distinction that the fault-line of the debate - practical advance versus ethical threat - lies. The first thing to say is that it is very hard to make any categorical statement about the respective merits and faults of adult and embryonic stem cells; stem cell science is still at a very early stage. That said, it does appear to be the case that embryonic stem cells are much more versatile than adult stem cells. Embryonic stem cells can develop into any of the 200 possible cell types; what is then needed is the scientific skill that will guide the developing embryonic cell down the right pathway towards becoming the ideal replacement cell.           And that's where the big problem is: the greater the power of embryonic stem cells for good, the greater the chance of bad. The use of embryonic stem cells in mice has on occasion led to the development of teratomas, some of the most monstrous of cancers. Those scientific drawbacks are coupled with the ethical difficulties that come with the cultivation of embryos expressly for the purpose of harvesting stem cells.          Those scientific and ethical shortcomings are significantly decreased with the use of adult stem cells. Mrs Gould's successful operation shows the great leaps that can be made in that less controversial - and less risky - sphere.          It is difficult, though, not to feel sympathy for Mrs Gould, who would herself be willing to take advantage of those more powerful embryonic stem cells, if they could be safely developed to give her a chance of even greater mobility."
telegraph,13/02/2005 00:01,finance,"            A group of prominent entrepreneurs is setting up a foundation to ensure that Britain remains at the forefront of research. Sylvia Pfeifer reports                   A group of Britain's leading financiers and entrepreneurs, including Sir Christopher Evans of Merlin Biosciences, the venture capital group, Sir Richard Branson of Virgin and Jon Moulton of Alchemy Partners have gathered in recent weeks to plot their latest endeavour.          These are not ordinary business meetings. Instead of talk about returns on investment and profit margins, the agenda has been all about 'making a difference', charitable donations and government funding.          What has brought people as diverse as Branson and Moulton, together with scientists such as Lord Winston, the fertility expert, Sir Richard Sykes, the rector of Imperial College, London and the former chairman of GlaxoSmithKline, and Evans is one objective: to ensure that Britain remains at the forefront of one of the most promising areas of medical science today – research into stem cells.          Stem cells are 'parent' cells of all the different types of cell in the human body. Scientists are studying stem cells, especially those derived from early embryos, because they offer the potential to turn back the biological clock and create a way for the body to rebuild itself.           Despite the billions spent on research by the world's pharmaceuticals giants, current drugs can do no more than slow the advance of such debilitating diseases as Parkinson's. But scientists believe that stem cells could one day replace damaged cells and rebuild tissues to help restore patients' health.           Until now, Britain has led the way, thanks to regulations allowing, after careful scrutiny, the creation of cloned human embryos for the production of stem cells for therapeutic purposes.           Last week, Ian Wilmut, the scientist who made history by successfully cloning a mammal – Dolly the sheep – was granted a licence to use stem cells from cloned human embryos to study motor neurone disease, which kills about 1,200 people in the UK every year. The licence is only the second to be granted in Britain.          However, the UK's position at the forefront of stem cell research has been achieved despite major funding problems. While British stem cell companies have gained early-stage funding, scientists have been forced to look abroad to help finance the next phase of their work. Even in the US, where regulation is much tighter and use of human embryonic stem cells is banned, several states have recently launched multi-billion dollar initiatives to fund research into the area.          Just over two years ago the British Government committed £40m over three years to fund early research. Tony Blair has been an advocate of stem cell research, arguing that it is crucial to the future of British science.           But if Britain is to retain its leadership, and, more importantly, if stem cell research is ever going to lead to treatments that generate real profits for the companies involved, a whole lot more funding is needed.           The result has been a plan to establish a public-private foundation to fund research. If all goes well, the foundation should be ready to launch this summer. According to Evans, it couldn't come soon enough. He fears that the UK, as it has so often, could once again lose its head start to other countries.           The history of British science is littered with examples of scientific discovery and then lost commercial opportunities. Penicillin, the first antibiotic, was a British discovery that ended up being developed in America.           Similarly, when monoclonal antibodies were discovered in Cambridge in 1975, the National Research Development Council, a government body then charged with identifying scientific winners, made the inexcusable decision that 'it is difficult for us to identify any immediate practical application'. Today, these antibodies, which can be used to target specific diseases such as cancer, have generated billions of pounds of revenue for investors.          'In the US [different states] have raised billions of dollars through different means. The US has got quoted stem cell companies whose valuations have gone through the roof in recent months. We are nowhere in sight,' says Evans. 'We invented this space. It's like monoclonal antibodies and penicillin all over again. I just feel we really have to get a move on . . . We have lost it if we haven't sorted it out by the summer.'          Moulton, the venture capitalist who has donated a big chunk of his own money to the foundation, agrees. And for once he isn't looking for a return on his investment.          'It's a purely charitable activity. There will be tremendous scientific activity in this area. We started out in front and there is a danger now that the UK could fall behind,' he told the Telegraph.          What has been missing, argues Evans, is funding to move the cutting-edge research being done in laboratories into development and launch the crucial clinical trials needed to develop the scientific breakthroughs into practical treatments.           'There isn't the money for clinical development,' he says. 'To do that work takes any time from 18 months to two years . . . And [you] need anywhere from at least £2m to £3.5m for each programme that you want to take into pre-clinical and early clinical stages. If you imagine there were 10, 20 people seriously interested in doing that, then you may be looking at between £50m and £60m. Where is the money going to come from?'          Certainly not from the public markets. In the US, stem cell companies such as Geron or StemCells Inc have managed to persuade institutional investors to back them, but in Britain the stock market has effectively been closed.           One company to experience this at first hand is ReNeuron, one of Evans's start-ups, which is focused on developing treatments for neurogenerative diseases. The company was floated on the Alternative Investment Market in November 2000 and raised more than £21m. But ReNeuron's shares never managed to get above the listing price and in May 2003 the company was taken private.           'The venture capital community is nowhere in sight, they ducked for cover many years ago. They see it as too risky. ReNeuron is our only serious stem cell company but there is not an exit for investors in the sense that there is no stock market appetite,' says Evans.          So he believes the only solutions are either government backing or funding from foundations. With the backing of trustees such as Branson and Moulton, the aim is to raise 'as much money as we can get' over five to six years. Evans says anything between £25m to £100m would be adequate, but to get the initiative off the ground it will have to be backed by funding from the Government.           The foundation will have its own scientific advisory board, headed by Professor Roger Pedersen, the head of the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, as well as a project review committee to carry out due diligence on potential projects.           A stem cell advisory board to pull all the existing groups of stem cell scientists across the UK together will also be set up, while people such as Nick Ross, the presenter of Crimewatch, have been recruited to spread the message to the wider public.           In essence, the aim is to get some proven development successes. At this point Evans is confident that the venture capital community will start to get interested: 'Venture capital groups won't invest until there is the proof of concept and proof in the clinic. That's when the money will start to flood in and that's when more commercial applications will start to appear.'          'Companies need to understand the complexity of having a marketable product,' says Trevor Jones, the chairman of ReNeuron. 'But there is no question in my mind, there will be products emerging in the next five to 10 years.'          Evans is in no doubt that stem cell research will ultimately make money. 'I've stuck my neck out, so have all the trustees,' he says. 'We got into lots of huddles and said: 'If we do this, guys, we are going to be very high-profile . . . and we ain't going to back a loser.' We have to collectively believe in that, and it's unanimous, to a man.'"
telegraph,9/1/2007 0:01,news,"            Roger Highfield believes the latest breakthrough is a triumph of hope over substance                  Another day, another stem cell breakthrough. The announcement of an 'ethical' source of stem cells from the fluid that surrounds the developing foetus in the womb triggered an avalanche of headlines this week because it offered a new way to sidestep the firestorm of controversy about embryo research.          But, as has happened so many times before, the brouhaha is a triumph of hope over substance. Stem cells can be 'persuaded' to develop into some of the 200-plus cell types in the body to repair damage from injury or disease. Those taken from early embryos can be turned into any other type of cell, while adult stem cells, such as those from bone marrow, have a much more limited repertoire.          Now it seems that amniotic fluid around the developing child contains stem cells that can also be coaxed towards becoming various cell types that might be useful in regenerative medicine, according to a report by Dr Anthony Atala of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, and colleagues in Nature Biotechnology.          The cells share properties of both embryonic and adult stem cells and may represent an intermediate between these two types. When grown in the right conditions, these 'AFS cells' can be differentiated towards cell types such as fat, bone, muscle, blood vessel, nerve and liver cells. 'Our hope is that these cells will provide a valuable resource for tissue repair and for engineered organs as well,' said Dr Atala, head of Wake Forest's regenerative medicine institute and senior researcher on the project.          Dr Paolo De Coppi, lead author and now of Great Ormond Street Hospital, argues that AFS cells are easier to grow in the lab than embryonic stem cells (they do not require a lawn of human 'feeder cells') and may offer advantages: 'For example, embryonic stem cells injected into muscle can form teratomas (cancers formed of a mass of different cell types) – amniotic stem cells do not do this.' In the long term, he does see applications, for instance the genetic modification in the womb of the AFS cells to correct diseases such as haemophilia.          The Vatican called the discovery 'a turning point we have waited for'. Cardinal Javier Barragan, the head of the Pontifical Council for Health, told the Italian newspaper La Stampa: 'What has been discovered is a leap forward, a very significant one because it does not harm any organ or discriminate against life.'          Despite what the Vatican may think, there are ethical issues with this new source of stem cells. Dr Robin Lovell-Badge, of the National Institute of Medical Research, Mill Hill, points out that amniocentesis is linked with a risk of miscarriage.          When there are other sources of stem cell that will not threaten the unborn child, such as umbilical cord blood, it seems unlikely anyone is going to harvest stem cells from amniotic fluid that is collected for anything other than a sound medical reason, such as testing for severe hereditary disease. Although a bank of stem cells could result from amniotic fluid collected for these tests, it would as a result be linked with abortion.          The second problem rests on a familiar issue to stem cell researchers: how flexible is the stem cell in question? Dr Lovell-Badge does not think the American team has demonstrated 'pluripotency', which is the ability to become all cell types of the adult, including germ cells (eggs and sperm). 'They are certainly highly multipotent, but this is not the same. The paper also rather lacks clear quantitative data.'          There is still much work to be done to establish how flexible umbilical and AFS cells are compared with the most flexible of all, embryonic stem cells. Dr Lovell-Badge said that the UK was fortunate in that it was allowed to carry out research on embryonic cells, which will still be necessary in the wake of the new work.          The remarkable reaction to the new study says much more about politics than science, reflecting how many people, including President George W. Bush, oppose the destruction of embryos, even if they are clumps of 100 or so cells. The Bush administration has severely restricted federal funding for embryo work, leading many scientists to search for alternative stem cell sources.          Last August, Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) in Worcester, Massachusetts, claimed it had developed another way to sidestep controversy. ACT's vice-president, Robert Lanza, and his colleagues experimented with 16 human embryos at the eight- to 10-cell stage. Doctors routinely pluck single cells from IVF embryos at that stage for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which scans these cells for diseases. The researchers adapted this to generate lines of embryonic stem cells.          ACT ended up destroying its embryos to make the most of the few it had, but, declared that, in principle, its method can deliver stem cell lines without killing embryos. But, once again, it is unclear that this solves the basic issue: cells taken from the early embryo could in theory develop into a baby. As Dr Lovell-Badge put it: 'The motivation for this kind of work seems to be to get around the political issues, not the ethical issues.'"
dailymail,18/02/2015 12:01,sciencetech,"Scientists have for the first time mapped out the molecular 'switches' that can turn on orsilence individual genes in the DNA in more than 100 types ofhuman cells.The groundbreaking accomplishment that reveals the complexity ofgenetic information and the challenges of interpreting it.Researchers unveiled the map of the 'epigenome' in thejournal Nature, alongside nearly two dozen relatedpapers.The mapping effort is being carried out under a 10-year,$240 million U.S. government research program, the RoadmapEpigenomics Program, which was launched in 2008.The human genome is the blueprint for building an individualperson. The epigenome can be thought of as the cross-outs andunderlinings of that blueprint: if someone's genome contains DNAassociated with cancer but that DNA is 'crossed out' bymolecules in the epigenome, for instance, the DNA is unlikely tolead to cancer.As sequencing individuals' genomes to infer the risk ofdisease becomes more common, it will become all the moreimportant to figure out how the epigenome is influencing thatrisk as well as other aspects of health. Sequencing genomes isthe centerpiece of the 'precision medicine' initiative that U.S.President Barack Obama announced this month.'The only way you can deliver on the promise of precisionmedicine is by including the epigenome,' said Manolis Kellis ofthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who led the mappingthat involved scientists in labs from Croatia to Canada and theUnited States.Drug makers including Merck & Co Inc., the Genentechunit of Roche Holding and GlaxoSmithKline Plc are conducting epigenetics research related to cancer, saidJoseph Costello of the University of California, San Francisco,director of one of four main labs that contributed data to theepigenome map.Epigenetic differences are one reason identical twins, whohave identical DNA, do not always develop the same geneticdiseases, including cancer.But incorporating the epigenome in precision medicine isdaunting.'A lifetime of environmental factors and lifestyle factors'influence the epigenome, including smoking, exercising, diet,exposure to toxic chemicals and even parental nurturing, Kellissaid in an interview. Not only will scientists have to decipherhow the epigenome affects genes, they will also have todetermine how the lives people lead affect their epigenome. The human genome is the sequence of all the DNA onchromosomes. The DNA is identical in every cell, from neurons tohearts to skin.It falls to the epigenome to differentiate the cells: as aresult of epigenetic marks, heart muscle cells do not make brainchemicals, for instance, and neurons do not make muscle fibers.The epigenome map published on Wednesday shows how each of127 tissue and cell types differs from every other at the levelof DNA. Because scientists involved in the Roadmap project havebeen depositing their findings in a public database as they wentalong, other researchers have been analyzing the informationbefore the map was formally published.One of the resulting studies show, for instance, that braincells from people who died with Alzheimer's disease hadepigenetic changes in DNA involved in immune response. Alzheimer's has never been seen as an immune-system disorder, sothe discovery opens up another possible avenue to understand andtreat it.Other researchers found that because the epigeneticsignature of different kinds of cells is unique, they couldpredict with nearly 90 percent accuracy where metastatic canceroriginated, something that is unknown in 2 percent to 5 percentof patients.As a result, epigenetic information might offer alife-saving clue for oncologists trying to determine treatment,said co-senior author Shamil Sunyaev, a research geneticist atBrigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.There is much more to come. Instead of the epigenome mapbeing the end, said Kellis, 'I very much see (it) as beginning adecade of epigenomics.'"
telegraph,21/06/2002 00:01,news," Cells from adult bone marrow could provide an alternative to embryo cells to make brain, heart, muscle or any other type of cell for new treatments, according to a study published yesterday.These so called 'stem cells' are of intense interest to scientists because they offer the potential to grow tissue to repair a damaged or ailing body, heralding a medical revolution. Earlier this year, scientists from Edinburgh University cast doubt on experiments that suggested stem cells from adults offered an ethical alternative to embryo cells. But, after the latest research in America, Prof Austin Smith, head of the Edinburgh team, said yesterday: 'This is a landmark paper. The study . . . emphasises the case for renewed investigation of all forms of stem cell.' The breakthrough was reported in Nature by a team from the University of Minnesota Stem Cell Institute, led by Dr Catherine Verfaillie. Although it will lead to calls by pro-Life groups to abandon the use of embryos for stem cell research, Dr Verfaillie said she firmly believed it was too early to say how bone marrow cells would compare with embryonic stem cells in longevity and function.Dr Verfaillie's team found that cells from adult mouse and rat bone marrow can be grown in the laboratory without ageing and contain telomerase, an enzyme found in embryonic stem cells that prevents ageing. Her research differs from previous studies because she shows that a single cell differentiates into three basic cell types, they had the correct number of chromosomes, and there had been no fusion with normal cells to make freak cells.Dr Verfaillie said she believed adult stem cells may hold therapeutic promise but cautioned that a large number of studies was still required. Side-by-side comparison of adult and embryonic stem cells must be done to determine which stem cells are most useful in treating a particular disease. A spokesman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said: 'The HFEA remains of the view that embryonic stem cell research work is important and sees no reason to alter existing HFEA policies and procedures in licensing stem cell work on the basis of one published paper.'The potential of stem cell research is shown by a separate paper, also published online in Nature yesterday, by Dr Ron McKay and colleagues at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Maryland. From cultured mouse embryonic stem cells the group generated a large supply of neurons that produce the messenger chemical dopamine, the same kind of cells that die off in Parkinson's disease.When transplanted into the brains of rats with damaged dopamine neurons, the neurons functioned normally. Furthermore, the rats treated with the new neurons showed signs of recovery. The study is one of the first to show that embryonic stem cells can develop into neurons that function in the brain, according to Dr McKay.Dr David Dexter of Imperial College, London, said: 'These two studies are a major step forward into whether stem cells can be used to treat Parkinson's disease.'Peter Garrett, LIFE's Director of Research, said: 'This makes embryonic human cloning as unnecessary as it is unethical. At last sufferers of terrible degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's can have hope that an effective treatment is on the horizon.'• Researchers at Georgetown University and colleagues report in the journal Science today that they have created a cell line from spermatogonia, the stem cells that produce sperm, for research on male infertility, testicular cancer, and possibly for gene therapy."
telegraph,9/6/2004 0:01,news,"            The Roslin Institute, home of Dolly the sheep, is turning its attention to humans. Roger Highfield reports                   Inside an unimpressive low-rise building just outside Edinburgh, a medical revolution has started. Named after a nearby village where a ruined castle lies, and surrounded by hills grazed by flocks of Scottish blackface sheep, the Roslin Institute bills itself as 'one of the world's leading centres for research on farm and other animals'.          To the dismay of pro-life campaigners, the revolution under way at Roslin concerns the most fascinating animal of all: Homo sapiens. After two decades doing related work with pigs, sheep and other livestock, Roslin has built up a major programme on human stem cells, cells that have the potential to be turned into any other type to repair a damaged body.          The effort dates back five years, to when the institute signed a deal to pool resources with the Californian company Geron, which, in turn, offered £12.5 million of funding over six years for research directed by Prof Ian Wilmut, head of the team that cloned Dolly the sheep, and Prof John Clark, known for his work on genetically altering farmyard animals so that they can produce drugs - human proteins - in their milk.          Geron's interest made commercial sense: it funded research at the University of Wisconsin that led to the successful isolation of human stem cells from embryos in 1998 by James Thomson. Still multiplying in the laboratory, his embryonic stem cells are among those being studied at Roslin. Dr Jim McWhir hopes to turn them into bone cells, while Prof Clark is studying how to make liver cells for drug testing and brain cells to treat Parkinson's disease.          In addition to research on existing stem cell lines, Geron and the institute's commitment to turning cells into treatments has been reflected by the establishment of a 'clinical-grade' laboratory for the isolation and growth of stem cells, led by Dr Paul De Sousa and backed by Scottish Enterprise and the Medical Research Council.          To use stem cells in medicine is a major undertaking. The laboratory must be sterile and the team must document everything to reassure regulators. In parallel, the team is searching for the best soup of chemicals in which to grow embryo stem cells. Ultimately, they want to find a reliable way to turn the cells into the desired type without risking infection with animal or human diseases.          Most human embryo stem cell lines isolated have been nurtured on animal (usually mouse) 'feeder' cells in a broth supplemented with foetal calf serum, a complex cocktail of substances with an action not fully understood. As a starting point, new cell lines being derived at Roslin are being grown on human cell feeders and the aim is to replace both feeder cells and serum.          As well as using established lines of human stem cells, the Roslin team is obtaining them from surplus embryos from IVF or those that have failed screening for congenital disease.          In a related project, led by Dr De Sousa with Prof Wilmut, Roslin has been given permission by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to realise an idea that dates back to Greek mythology, when Athena emerged from the forehead of Zeus: this is an early reference to parthenogenesis, meaning 'virgin birth' (that is why Athena's temple on the Acropolis is called the Parthenon).          Most plants can multiply by parthenogenesis, as do all fungi and many animals, such as corals. Birds and bees do it, too. But parthenogenesis cannot naturally give rise to offspring in mammals, and thus humans, because of a process called imprinting.          Imprinting controls the way maternal and paternal genes are used in the body. Imprints are critical for development, notably the creation of the placenta, the embryo's lifeline to the mother, and disruption of imprinting is linked with congenital diseases, schizophrenia, immune deficiency and forms of cancer.          In normal sexual reproduction, an egg or sperm loses half of its chromosomes so that when the two come together during fertilisation the full number is restored in the resulting embryo. In parthenogenesis, it is possible to use a shock of electricity or chemicals to make an egg divide. The unfertilised egg can also be tricked by chemicals into keeping the chromosomes that it would otherwise have jettisoned in what are called polar bodies.          The result is a parthenogenetic embryo - a parthenote - that retains the full set of DNA of one woman. Although it cannot normally develop to form offspring, the parthenote provides insights into imprinting and is a source of stem cells: they could be used to treat the woman and, regardless of the sex of the recipient, to treat Parkinson's, where an exact tissue match is not required when nerve cells are transplanted into the brain.           The ability to make parthenogenetic embryos will also help Roslin test if attempts to ripen immature human eggs from ovarian tissue are successful. This could help address the shortage of human eggs for research. A better understanding of how to encourage eggs to mature in the laboratory may also help women undergoing IVF treatment, notably those suffering from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, when their eggs do not mature properly.          And the parthenogenesis programme will also help with the most controversial part of the Roslin programme, involving cell nuclear replacement or cloning: this offers a way to create an embryo from a patient, their stem cells and thus the patient's own cells.          Cloning exploits how the human egg has the wherewithal to 'reprogramme' introduced DNA so it no longer says 'skin' or 'bone', but is flexible enough to drive the development of an embryo.          First, however, scientists need to work out the 'activation protocol': fooling the egg into thinking it is fertilised, and here the way an egg can be tricked to form a parthenote will provide vital information.          At a conference in Berlin in 2002, Prof Wilmut announced that he and Dr De Sousa would apply for what was widely expected to be Britain's first licence to clone human embryos. They have yet to make a submission to the HFEA and the first has come from another team in Newcastle.          The target of the forthcoming application will be motor neurone disease, caused by the death of the nerve cells that control movement. Symptoms include muscle weakness in one or more limbs and also the muscles that supply the face and throat, causing problems with speech and difficulty chewing and swallowing.          Prof Wilmut said the understanding of the genetics of the disease is lacking, as is the extent to which various nerve cell types are affected. There are no effective treatments. The Roslin hopes to collaborate with the Institute of Psychiatry in London to develop normal and diseased nerve cell lines so the effects of the disease can be pinned down exactly.          These cells could provide an alternative to animal testing, although opponents of any kind of cloning will find the idea of 'embryos for medical testing' as objectionable as 'embryos for spare parts'.          Prof Wilmut said: 'It is critical to understand exactly the stage of development we are talking about. Since the embryo in question does not have that key human characteristic of awareness, it would be immoral not to take the opportunity to study diseases.'          There are four cloning methods and Prof Wilmut prefers two quicker and easier alternatives to the Dolly technique, called zona-free methods, developed by Teija Peura and colleagues from the South Australian Research and Development Institute, and Bjorn Oback and colleagues at New Zealand-based AgResearch, and the universities of Waikato and Groningen.          The Dolly 'nuclear transfer' method involves removing DNA from an adult cell and transferring it into an egg that has had its own DNA removed. The reprogrammed egg is then stimulated to divide and form a cloned embryo. To remove and inject DNA requires precise methods - under a microscope using manipulation apparatus worth tens of thousands of pounds.          In one zona-free method, the zona pellucida - a thick, transparent 'shell' that surrounds the egg - is removed and the egg is split into two, allowing easy removal of DNA. The contents of one or more emptied eggs are then placed in a fusion chamber together with donor DNA from an adult and are fused by electrical stimulation.          The second, 'reverse-order', zona-free method involves removing the DNA from zona-free eggs after they have been fused with the DNA from adult cells. (Note to wannabe baby cloners: though easier to do, zona-free methods are still technically demanding.)          The potential applications of 'therapeutic cloning' are vast. Aside from providing cells for transplant, such work will provide insights into embryo development with potential applications for infertility and miscarriage, and the diagnosis and prevention of birth defects.          Cells made by therapeutic cloning can be used to screen drugs, model human diseases or to test chemicals for toxicity. Roslin hopes to explore the possibilities in a year or so.

telegraph,23/01/2008 10:00,news,"One thousand people are to have their entire DNA codes mapped in a major effort to understand how genes influence individual differences in susceptibility to disease, response to drugs or reaction to pollutants.                                                      Craig Venter reads his entire DNA 'recipe book'                                              To date, only a handful of humans have had their genomes analysed in this way, notably scientists Craig Venter and James Watson.         Today an international consortium announced the '1000 Genomes Project' to read (sequence) the 'letters' of DNA in the genomes of at least 1000 people from around the world to create the most detailed and medically useful picture to date of human genetic variation.            'The 1000 Genomes Project will examine the human genome at a level of detail that no one has done before,' said Dr Richard Durbin of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, near Cambridge, who is co-chair of the consortium. 'Such a project would have been unthinkable only two years ago.'             Any two humans are more than 99 per cent the same at the level of the genetic material DNA. However, it is important to understand the small fraction of genetic material that varies among people because it can help explain individual differences in susceptibilities.         Variation in the human genome is organised into local neighbourhoods called haplotypes, which are stretches of DNA usually inherited as intact blocks of information.          The scientific goals of the 1000 Genomes Project are to produce a catalogue of variants that are present at one per cent or greater frequency in the human population across most of the genome, and down to 0.5 per cent or lower within genes.          In addition to accelerating the search for genetic variants involved in susceptibility to common diseases, the 1000 Genomes Project will provide a deeper understanding of human genetic variation and open the door to many other new findings of significance to both medicine and basic human biology.          Using standard DNA sequencing technologies, the effort would likely cost more than £250 million. However, leaders of the 1000 Genomes Project expect the costs to fall to as little as £15 million by the use of new sequencing technologies.         During its two-year production phase, the project will read the equivalent of more than two human genomes every 24 hours. The volume of data - and the interpretation of those data - will pose a major challenge.          'This project will examine the human genome in a detail that has never been attempted - the scale is immense. At 6 trillion DNA bases, the 1000 Genomes Project will generate 60-fold more sequence data over its three-year course than have been deposited into public DNA databases over the past 25 years,' says Dr Gil McVean, of the University of Oxford, one of the co-chairs of the consortium's analysis group.         'In fact, when up and running at full speed, this project will generate more sequence in two days than was added to public databases for all of the past year.'          Among the populations whose DNA will be sequenced in the 1000 Genomes Project are: Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria; Japanese in Tokyo; Chinese in Beijing; Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe; Luhya in Webuye, Kenya; Maasai in Kinyawa, Kenya; Toscani in Italy; Gujarati Indians in Houston; Chinese in metropolitan Denver; people of Mexican ancestry in Los Angeles; and people of African ancestry in the southwestern United States.          The sequencing work will be carried out at the Sanger Institute, BGI Shenzhen and National Human Genome Research Institute's Large-Scale Sequencing Network, which includes the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; the Washington University Genome Sequencing Centre at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis; and the Human Genome Sequencing Centre at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.          The data will be held by and distributed from the European Bioinformatics Institute near Cambridge, UK, and the National Centre for Biotechnology Information in the USA."
telegraph,6/9/2001 0:00,news,"   Genetic manipulation will fuel a new debate at the British Association Festival of Science. Chandrika Nath reports  WHEN ANDi the GM monkey was unveiled by American researchers in January, he heralded a new era of genetic manipulation and sparked a dispute over how far the technology should go.Scientists at the British Association Festival of Science in Glasgow will discuss the use of animals in medical research. These days the familiar debate has a new dimension, which is fuelled by our ability to genetically modify animals: is it right to create creatures that can suffer human diseases and, if it is, where do we draw the line?According to public opinion polls, genetic modification is often seen as an unnatural procedure carried out by scientists with little compassion for the animals involved. A survey conducted by The Daily Telegraph, published today on this page, shows that, on the contrary, even scientists at the forefront of genetic research have misgivings.The creation of ANDi (whose name spells 'inserted DNA' backwards) at Oregon Primate Research Centre led to concerns that laboratories would soon be filled with genetically modified (transgenic) monkeys and other non-human primates such as gorillas, orang-utans and chimpanzees. Most people feel uncomfortable with the concept of GM rats and mice, let alone primates, our hairy relatives.Since the birth of the first GM mouse in 1981, the number of GM animals used in research has soared. Last year more than half a million were used in UK laboratories alone - a 14 per cent increase on 1999. The number of animals used in British experiments increased for the first time in 25 years because of the increasing reliance on transgenic animals. Over 99 per cent of all transgenic animals created were rodents - the rest were fish and ungulates (any mammal with hooves).The most common way to create a genetically modified animal is to inject an egg with thousands of fragments of foreign DNA - the genetic recipe of life - in the hope that a foreign gene will mesh with the animal's own DNA.A key application is the creation of animals that suffer human-like diseases. This research might one day result in treatments for spectres like cancer, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease.But for every transgenic animal that is created, many more do not take up the foreign gene and are usually destroyed. ANDi was one of only three live births that resulted from injecting 224 eggs with the jellyfish gene. The other two monkeys have since died.Transgenic animals often develop abnormalities, which cause suffering and even premature death. The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) described the rise in transgenic animal research as 'outrageous', particularly in the light of the Government's earlier pledges to reduce animal suffering in laboratories.The Daily Telegraph approached 150 genetics researchers based in Britain to ask their opinion. Only 45 replied. It is unlikely they are all on holiday, so perhaps scientists are wary of discussing the issue. Of those who replied, nine out of 10 wanted to remain anonymous. One explained this was 'for reasons of personal safety', underlining how a small contingent of animal rights campaigners has intimidated researchers.Yet others wanted to speak out. Dr Michael Ashburner of Nottingham University is growing weary of intolerance towards GM research in our predominantly meat-eating society. He said: 'I am quite prepared for people to be opposed to this research on ethical grounds, as long as they refuse the benefits of modern medicine and hold this as a personal view, without attempting to persuade the rest of society that theirs is the only possible view to hold.'More than 90 per cent of the respondents thought the recent boom in transgenic animals could be justified by the benefits it would bring society. But one scientist did not foresee any 'major benefits to society' from the current increase in transgenic animals, while another voiced concerns over 'the number of GM organisms produced by researchers who carry out research of very little value'.The replies show that animal rights campaigners are not alone in their concerns about ANDi. Three in four scientists - many actively involved in experiments on transgenic animals - are troubled by the creation of GM monkeys and other non-human primates. Many pointed out that any experiments on primates are a cause for concern.But, despite reservations, almost 90 per cent thought carefully controlled experiments on GM primates should be allowed as a last resort for certain uses. Primate research should be avoided if at all possible, but 'there may be pressing reasons when we are forced down that route', believes Prof John Burn of Newcastle University. Another researcher explained that genetic techniques offer such exciting prospects for the future of mankind that they 'cannot be stopped'.Over half thought that there was no viable alternative to using primates, at least in the short term. Since primates are much more similar to us than rodents, many think GM primate research will be the only way to test treatments for disorders of the nervous system, for example.Dr Simon Festing of the Association of Medical Research Charities also thinks there may be some instances where experiments on GM primates are necessary, but he added: 'I don't think we know which cases they are yet.'ANDi's creators came in for further criticism. One researcher said GM primates might have some uses, but thought Prof Gerald Schatten and his team at Oregon had carried out a 'terrible piece of research'. He said the experiments constituted 'a totally unjustified use of primates'.Others pointed out that what goes for a rhesus monkey like ANDi does not necessarily follow for other primates. Dr John Brookfield of Nottingham University said he 'would not be happy with the use of chimpanzees, gorillas or orang-utans for any experiments that might cause distress or pain, whatever the benefits - although he added that there was nothing necessarily harmful in making an organism transgenic. Another researcher disagreed with the creation of GM great apes, since it was 'difficult to think of any instance where monkeys would not be adequate'.In Britain, restrictions on primate research are tighter than for other animals. But are they tight enough? One researcher said he would not be surprised if some unnecessary experiments took place. Another suspected that some primate research was done simply to attract attention - some people 'tailor their science to the 'hype' factor'.Not all scientists were in favour of GM primate research. One in 10 did not think it could be justified and even doubted whether it would be of any use. One researcher explained that, at the moment, 'the benefits of using GM primates are too intangible, with potential serious technical problems - as such, any promise for me does not at this moment outweigh the serious ethical issues of experimentation on primates.' What British scientists think about GM primates  1) Do you think the potential benefits of using transgenic animals justify the recent steep increase in their use?

Around a corner, without warning, you'll confront a glass cabinet containing a human corpse. It is the embalmed remains of one of the most influential of all moral philosophers, Jeremy Bentham. Although he lived 200 years ago, his ideas are of crucial relevance to ANDi, the first GM monkey.Bentham was a founder of Utilitarianism - a seductively simple idea. In his book Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation (1789), he announced that ethical behaviour consists simply of 'the production of the greatest possible quantity of happiness'.What might seem naive turns out to be profoundly practical. It is central to the way that we still think about a host of moral dilemmas - human rights, just wars, social policy, animal welfare.The principle of Utilitarianism underpins the law governing medical research on animals in this country. All experiments on animals, however innocuous the procedures and strict the precautions, are likely to cause some loss of happiness (assuming, as we surely should, that animals can have feelings). Anyone applying for a licence to do experiments has to convince committees and inspectors that the potential benefits (alleviating the suffering of sick people or other animals, or advancing knowledge towards such gains) outweigh the suffering. It's called 'cost-benefit analysis'.In a Mori poll a couple of years ago, an extraordinary 83 per cent of people said that they would approve of painless experiments on mice aimed at developing a treatment for leukaemia. But only 52 per cent approved if the research was to be done on monkeys and involved pain or illness. And a mere 17 per cent, if the aim was to test a garden insecticide. Clearly, when people are asked to consider the pros and cons of animal research, they do a Jeremy Bentham in their heads!The big problem with cost-benefit analysis, in its basic form, is that it's only a matter of balance. But what if the cost - the potential for suffering - becomes very great? Can it be outweighed by even greater gains?Changing the genes of animals offers the prospect of creating realistic animal 'models' of human diseases, and therefore a much better chance of discovering cures for such horrendous conditions as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and muscular dystrophy. But once the genetic manipulation is done, it's all too easy to forget that the animals, and their offspring, suffer those diseases in the service of science.I think that genetic manipulation is a valuable development, which promises hope to millions condemned to die from genetic disorders. My own research group is studying a GM mouse that carries the human gene for Huntington's disease, a condition that normally never occurs in mice. Yet these transgenic mice develop all the main symptoms of the disease, and they have enabled rapid advances to be made towards its treatment. I'm in agreement with the 93 per cent of genetic researchers in the Daily Telegraph poll who think that the rapid rise in the creation and use of GM animals is justified by the potential benefits of this area of research.But, so far, virtually all of those GM animals have been mice. I'm not a geneticist by training and my views may carry less weight than those surveyed in the Telegraph poll. Nevertheless, I'm disappointed that so few of those who responded thought that transgenic rodents offer enough opportunity for essential medical research. My gut reaction is to think that we shouldn't use this approach on highly intelligent creatures such as monkeys unless there is absolutely no alternative.I'm glad, then, that 74 per cent of those responding agree that the creation of GM monkeys is a cause for special concern. But, given the rapid progress that has been made with transgenic mice, it's surprising that a similar large majority believe that the development of GM primates can be justified.ANDi, the first GM monkey, carries a totally harmless gene that makes his cells slightly fluorescent. I think that we should wait and see what progress can be made with GM mice before we go further. We might need GM primates at some stage, but I hope that we won't.n  n  Colin Blakemore is Professor of Physiology at the University of Oxford.

telegraph,3/1/2006 10:10,technology,"            Despite the humiliating setback in Korea over cloning, Steve Jones believes there will be a breakthrough before the end of the decade                  This month gets its name from the Roman deity who looks back at the year just gone and forward to the next.          The great biologist J B S Haldane, in a memorable poem written shortly before his death, saw a parallel in his own experiences: 'So now I am like two-faced Janus, The only god who sees his anus'. Cancer's a Funny Thing begins: 'I wish I had the voice of Homer, To sing of rectal carcinoma, Which kills a lot more chaps, in fact, Than were bumped off when Troy was sacked'. Haldane's insight into his rear end came from a colostomy, but his bowel cancer spread, and killed him.          January's extinct icon tells us first that science may, alas, itself be two-faced. A month ago, 2006 seemed set to be the Year of the Stem Cell, with dramatic news of success in cloning such things from human embryos. Very exciting - except that a few days before Christmas the claims by the Korean Hwang Woo-Suk to have done so were comprehensively rubbished.          Janus is a persistent little deity though, and my guess is that Stem Cell Year really will be with us before the end of the decade. Its arrival will also remind us that, as Janus would be glad to learn, the latest science often has roots in a distant past.          The stem-cell breakthrough happened long ago. Hercules was obliged as one of his Labours to kill the Hydra, which was hard because the beast grew two heads whenever one was cut off. She gave her name to a tiny freshwater polyp - and stem cell research began. In 1744 the Geneva biologist Abraham Trembley cut a Hydra into two. To his surprise the body grew a head, and the head sprouted a body - and he persuaded some of his subjects to grow seven heads. The animal did the same of its own accord, for it copied itself by budding. Trembley's friend, Charles Bonnet, went further. In a remarkable prediction he suggested that such creatures contained 'sleeping embryos' that woke up when a part of the body was removed, to replace it. Those somnolent structures are now called stem cells.          Hydra has a rare talent, for it can live for ever. In principle, the specimens I squinted at in school 50 years ago will outlive me (in practice, they were poured down the sink). It replaces its substance at regular intervals, for most of its cells are stem cells. They give the beast the immortality we lack.          Each day, our own body replaces 10 billion of its own cells. Even after New Year's Eve everyone is younger than they feel. Those who lived through the Fifties picked up lots of radioactive carbon from nuclear tests. A quick check of its concentration shows that the average age of a 50-year-old's cells is only about 10 years. Skin cells last two weeks, red blood cells four months and a typical liver has not reached its first birthday (everyone, though, has an elderly heart and brain). For guts, livers, and more, adult stem cells constantly renew the tissues.          Exactly a century ago, Hydra opened a new chapter in biology. A mashed extract of head applied to a different individual caused new heads to appear. Soluble chemicals, it seemed, control development. Repair, too, turns on messages diffusing from a source to a target cell and to the DNA itself.          Birth and death are at their busiest in parts of the body that - like a liver or a Hydra - call for constant repair. Damage caused by alcohol or tobacco have long been known to lead to cancer. The repair process has run out of control; the illness is a nightmare in which the sleeping embryos of M. Bonnet stay awake long after they should. Certain drugs suppress its symptoms. Too often, though, a break in treatment means resurgence. The source of the problem, the stem cells, is at fault. Such things are tough, and drugs that kill off their descendants have no effect on them.          The inner surface of the intestine is a hectic place, for its cells are replaced every few days. Its lower parts are dotted with millions of pits. Each has a nucleus of about half a dozen stem cells that makes hundreds of offspring each day. They migrate upwards. Soon they are beyond the reach of the instructions to divide, cease to do so, and join the gut's protective sheet. Within a week they die.          A certain form of colon cancer (not, as far as we know, the one that killed Haldane) runs in families. It leads to the formation of lumps of tissue called - in an echo of the underwater world - polyps. Unless they are removed they can spread and kill. The stem cells hidden in each pit are in revolt. A single copy of the damaged gene responsible is inherited from one parent. It does no harm as long as the second, normal, version continues with its job. Should that back-up be hit by mutation - which, given the untold millions of divisions in the gut, is bound to happen sooner or later - the system runs out of control. Daughters continue to divide, mutations build up, and the diseased tissues become malignant.          The error is in the signal network in charge of cell division. Complex as that is, it has a few pivotal points. The wingless mutation of the fruit fly revealed a major one. Flies unlucky enough to inherit it remain on the ground, for they lack the means to get into the air.          Exactly the same DNA sequence is found in ourselves. Men have no need for wings, but the unmutated form of the gene keeps stem cells under control. It is at the centre of the machinery of repair. After a broken bone or a graze to the gut, its protein is the first step in a chain of signals that tells the body to put the damage right. The protein is swallowed up by its target cells and makes its way to the nucleus. When it shuts down, division comes to an end - but in cancer, the master gene refuses to stop, and leads to disaster.          The wingless control system is ancient indeed, for the genes that cause the fly mutation and human gut problems are almost identical to those that leap into action when Hydra buds off a new head. Over billions of years some parts of the molecule have changed, but the crucial section that binds to cell receptors is almost identical.          And what of the future? Not all the news is bad. If the illness is caught in time treatment can save the patient. Already, adult stem cells are infused to allow the safe use of larger doses of drugs or radiation to kill a tumour. Once, a diagnosis of cancer could not be made until there was a physical hint of trouble; and often that came too late. Now, an altered signal gene is used as a first sign. Medicines that interfere with the wingless system itself are being used in treatment. A few are even based on extracts of marine polyps. An attack on stem cells might one day cure, rather than just slowing, one of our worst killers.          Bonnet was worried by the doctrinal implications of his 'sleeping embryos'. When a Hydra copies itself, do both bits have a soul? The notion that embryonic stem cells might be allowed to grow into adulthood is still much denounced. Many countries refuse to accept their use in medicine because of their origin in fertilised eggs, each of which is supposed to have a soul of its own. American policy is an ethical mess, Germans accept embryonic stem cells as long as they are not German and, until recently, Switzerland banned them altogether. Korea is less tense about embryonic stem cells than anywhere else, but alas, relaxation led to laxity and to a real scientific setback.          Fortunately, there is still plenty of action with adult, rather than embryonic, stem cells. The promises are spectacular - and, just before Christmas, the Chancellor announced a £100 million boost for such work. One tranche goes to the independent Stem Cell Foundation, set up a few months ago. It must match his generous offer of public funds with private donations. Those with an eye on the future, and sufficient cash, might consider an investment of their own in case, one day, they too need a match, not of cash, but of the genes of a stem-cell donor.

telegraph,16/10/2007 00:01,news,"            Geneticist Craig Venter explains how, by artificially producing DNA, his team could design 'green' microbes that digest toxic waste                  My car pulled up in front of the Oval Room restaurant on Connecticut Avenue, a few blocks from the White House.          It was Friday, September 3, 2003, and I had been summoned to an urgent meeting by Ari Patrinos, who was then working at the Department of Energy as the head of its office of biological research.          Joining us was John H Marburger III, science adviser to the President, and Lawrence Kerr, director of Bioterrorism, Research and Development for the Office of Homeland Security, among others.          This high-powered gathering had been arranged only two hours before. The group was keen to discuss a breakthrough in the project that their department was funding, a $3 million initiative to 'develop a synthetic chromosome'. It was the first step towards making a self-replicating organism with an artificial genetic make-up, or genome.         At the J Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland, my team - principally the Nobel laureate Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison - had made a leap forward in our ability to ''make' DNA.          After more than five years' work, we had finally managed the synthesis of biologically active Phi-X174, a virus that infects the bacterium E. coli. Now we had achieved this goal, we could begin to move from making a virus to creating new types of micro-organisms that could be used in numerous ways, as green fuels to replace oil and coal, digest toxic waste or absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.         Marburger interrupted me constantly with questions as I outlined our work.          When it became clear that we could now probably synthesise any virus with a genetic code of fewer than 10,000 'letters' of DNA in under a week in the lab, and larger viruses such as the Marburg or Ebola virus (both very unpleasant) in a month or so, Kerr sat there, silently mouthing 'Wow!' over and over.         The news eventually went all the way up to the White House and I was asked if I'd be willing to have my work studied by a new committee called the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity.          The committee investigates 'dual-use' research - that is, work that can be used to cause as much harm as good. I thought it was a good idea. I believed there was an urgent need for this sort of review.          Research of the sort we were engaged in could theoretically have devastating consequences if it fell into the wrong hands. Teams of scientists have, for example, worked on making the bird flu virus, H5N1, even more infectious to humans.          Determining what would turn the virus into a pandemic strain - capable of infecting millions of people worldwide - is crucial if we are to be safeguarded against it. But such findings could also be abused by bioterrorists.          After some deliberation, the committee urged us to publish the paper on Phi-X174 uncensored. It appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on December 23, 2003.         Spencer Abraham, Secretary of State for Energy, agreed to participate in a press conference in Washington, DC. He described the work as 'nothing short of amazing' and predicted that it could lead to the creation of designer microbes tailored to deal with pollution or excess carbon dioxide, or even to meet future fuel needs.          Ham Smith joined us to field some of the questions. Although we had rehearsed what he should and should not say, he seemed to forget all that when he was asked about the possibility of making deadly pathogens.         'We could make the smallpox genome,' Ham blurted out. I interrupted to point out that while that was indeed possible, it was known that smallpox DNA is not infective on its own, attempting to pour at least a little cold water on Ham's speculation.          Fortunately, his comment went no further than a paragraph in the New York Times, and the coverage was mostly favourable.         Scientists, though, were divided. Eckard Wimmer of Stony Brook University, New York State, who had taken three years to make a polio virus (compared with our two weeks), called it 'a very smart piece of work', but to others our virus was no big deal.          None the less, the advance was sufficiently exciting for Ari Patrinos to become president of my new company, Synthetic Genomics, dedicated to pushing forward with the work.          Ham Smith and I also convinced Clyde Hutchison to join the Venter Institute full-time to construct a synthetic genome based on Mycoplasma genitalium, a parasitic bacterium that lives in the genital tract.          Compared with what had gone before, it was a hugely ambitious project - we were trying to make a genome that was far larger than the Phi-X174 virus. While a virus is a complicated chemical (DNA coated with protein), a bacterium is 100 times bigger, and truly a living thing.         After computational analysis of what individual genes did in the Mycoplasma genitalium, we ended up with a set of about 99 genes that we thought could be dispensed with. That is to say, one-fifth of its genome was redundant, and we now had a glimpse of life at its bare genetic minimum.          With the new techniques we had developed while making a virus, Ham, Clyde, and I launched an attempt to construct the entire genome of Mycoplasma genitalium from lab-made chemicals.         At each stage, we had to develop new approaches to deal with the tremendous technical challenges. Aware of how even a single mistake in the DNA code can be lethal to the functioning bug, we had to read the 580,000 'letters' of the Mycoplasma genome at an unprecedented level of accuracy.         Then we had to rebuild a stripped-down version. The team used a standard laboratory machine to make small structures of DNA, known as oligonucleotides, or 'oligos'. These are the building blocks of our artificial genome.          With clever chemistry Ham and his team painstakingly stitched myriad tiny blocks of 50 or so letters into fewer small pieces, grew them in the bacterium E. coli, and then turned these many small pieces into a handful of bigger ones - cassettes of genes - until they got two large pieces that could be assembled into the circular genome of the new lifeform.         We had to make and manipulate synthetic DNA on a scale 10 to 20 times bigger than has been accomplished before. But we have now made the circular genome and are currently working on inserting the synthetic DNA into bacteria.          We are holding our breath to see whether one or more microbes among the 100 billion in the test tube 'boots up' with a strand of our man-made DNA and reproduces the DNA so a daughter cell starts metabolising and multiplying according to our version of life's recipe.          In readiness for experiments to transplant a synthetic genome, we have also applied for patents on how to create what we call 'Mycoplasma laboratorium'. But I should stress that we have not succeeded in implanting the synthetic genome. Yet.         If our plan succeeds, a new creature will have entered the world, albeit one that relies on an existing organism's cellular machinery to read its artificial DNA. We have often been asked if this will be a step too far. I always reply that - so far at least - we are only reconstructing a diminished version of what is already out there in nature.          I add that we have conducted a major ethical review of what we are doing, which reported in 1999, and we feel that this is good science.         The first synthetic genome is only the beginning. I now want to go further. My company, Synthetic Genomics Inc, is already trying to turn an organism into a biofactory that could make clean hydrogen fuel from sunlight and water or soak up more carbon dioxide.          From there, I want to take us into unknown waters, to a new phase of evolution, to the day when one DNA-based species can sit down at a computer to design another. I plan to show that we understand the software of life by creating true artificial life. And in this way, I want to discover whether a life decoded is truly a life understood.         •'A Life Decoded: My Genome, My Life' by Craig Venter (Allen Lane) is available for £23 + £1.25 p&p.

WHAT MY GENES TELL ME ABOUT MY DESTINY         My genetic autobiography can be found throughout my body. Each of my one hundred trillion cells (with the exception of my sperm and red blood cells) packages my DNA in 46 chromosomes, shown here, a number typical of humans and of no particular significance.          Along my chromosomes are distributed around 23 thousand genes, a much lower number than we once thought.         The DNA code in each gene is responsible for a protein, one of the basic units that build and operate my cells. Since I finished reading my genetic code, I have looked for genes that might shed light on my life.          Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is marked by inattention, impulsivity, and distractibility - an accurate description of the teenage Venter. Recent research has linked this disorder with a genetic stutter that involves ten repeats of a section of a gene called DAT1.          My genome reveals that I do indeed have these 10 repeats. Hence my behaviour - if, that is, you really believe a simple genetic stutter can trigger such a complex trait.         A protein called apolipoprotein E (Apo E) is responsible for regulating levels of certain fats in the bloodstream, variants of which have been linked with heart disease and also to Alzheimer's disease.          I can summon my genome on a computer screen and examine chromosome 19, where the Apo E gene is found. The gene comes in three common forms, known as E2, E3, and E4. E3 is predominant in European/Caucasian populations and in health terms is the 'best'.          By contrast, the seven per cent of people who have two copies of E4 are at higher risk of early heart disease, as are the four per cent of people with two copies of E2, who are more vulnerable to high-cholesterol, if they eat high-fat diets.          Carriers of E4 - which differs by just one letter from the 'good' E3 - have also been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's.         I have one copy of E3 and, unfortunately, one of E4, too. Although there is no evidence of Alzheimer's on either side of my family, it is possible that carriers of this gene, like my father, died too soon for this awful degenerative disease to manifest itself.          I am now taking a statin, a fat-lowering drug, to counteract its effects. The same statin also shows some degree of prevention of the symptoms of Alzheimer's.         Another of my genes, known as Complement Factor H, has a variation that has been linked by several studies to a 'very high' risk for macular degeneration, a common disease that causes degeneration of the centre of the retina, with devastating effects on central vision.          Of the two copies of the gene, only one of mine is mutated this way, raising my risk of the disease by about four times.         But it is not all bad news. The gene 'klotho' was named after the Greek Fate purported to spin the thread of life, because it contributes to longevity. I have a blend of klotho gene variants that have been linked with a lower risk for coronary artery disease and stroke and an advantage in longevity.          But we all have 'good' and 'bad' genes, and how their influence pans out when the effects of environment are taken into account is anyone's guess. CV"
telegraph,4/9/2007 12:00,news,"            The first reading of the entire DNA recipe of one person shows humans are more individual than thought, reports Roger Highfield                                                                 The man behind DNA                                             An American scientist today becomes the first person in history to publish his entire genetic makeup, the DNA 'recipe book' that he inherited from his parents, launching the era of personal genomics.           Craig Venter, the swashbuckling and controversial pioneer of the effort to read all the genes in a human - the human genome - has now produced the ultimate autobiography, the six billion chemical units in his entire complement of DNA, at an estimated cost of £35 million.           The study of his entire genetic recipe suggests that traditional methods to chart differences that make one person more susceptible to cancer, stroke and other diseases than others - along with appearance, ability and other key differences - miss crucial variations, revealing that humans are much more individual at the level of their DNA than previously thought.           While the first draft human genomes, unveiled in 2000, marked an extraordinary scientific feat they were composites of DNA from different people: the one produced by Mr Venter's company Celera was based on five individuals, with 60 per cent of the DNA coming from his own sperm, for example.           And the rival efforts only focused on one copy of the human code, when in fact each person inherits two, one from their father and one from their mother.           Today, the first full genetic recipe of a single human is unveiled in the journal PLos Biology, the result of a new effort in a paper coauthored by more than 30 people, notably his colleagues Samuel Levy, Granger Sutton and Jiaqi Huang, and collaborators at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and University of California San Diego.           Called a diploid genome, it consists of the DNA in both sets of chromosomes, one from each parent, and it is the full genome possessed by almost all the cells of Mr Venter.           This will probably be the first and last genome read in this accurate way, because of the expense, said Dr Venter, though the cost is falling all the time due to new technologies and he expects to see many thousands of human genomes to be read over the coming few years with quicker and dirtier methods.           Using clever methods to unpick the different DNA contributions of his parents, today's study shows that there is a difference of half a percent, five times more than previous efforts, a finding described as surprising and important.           Almost half the genes that Mr Venter has inherited from his mother are slightly different from those from his father, or even missing in one parent. 'Each time we peer into the human genome, we uncover more valuable insight into our intricate biology,' said Dr Venter.           The paper shows that earlier work was 'flawed,' he said, because it missed a lot of overall human variation, since it shows the amount of DNA differences between two humans is significantly larger than implied by the first draft genomes.           'This is good news for humanity,' he said, given the initial genomes made us all 'look like clones.'           There are more than 4.1 million genetic variations in the new full genome, including more than three million single letter spelling mistakes, 53,000 blocks of DNA that had basic differences, more than 852,000 places where bits of DNA had been inserted or lost, and many places where a series of letters was repeated to different extents.           A total of more than 1.2 million new variants have been discovered. 'With this publication, we have shown that human-to-human variation is five to seven-fold greater than earlier estimates, proving that we are in fact very unique individuals at the genetic level,' he said.           His team can conclude that Mr Venter does indeed have blue eyes, 'wet' type earwax, genetic factors linked with novelty and thrill seeking, some protection from tobacco addiction (though many more are linked with taking up the habit).           He is now taking statin drugs because the analysis reveals a variant of genes called SORL1 and Apo E4 linked with Alzheimer's, a major cause of dementia.           Mr Venter has asthma and one reason is down to differences in his glutathione S-transferase (GST) family of enzymes, which helps to detoxify compounds, from carcinogens to drugs and toxins. He will reveal more details next month in his autobiography, A Life Decoded.           But making sense of it all will take years. Mr Venter's variations of a gene called LCT should mean he can drink milk but in fact he is lactose intolerant, showing that more genes must be involved in this particular trait.           'We are still at the earliest stages of discovery about ourselves, and only with continued sequencing of more individual genomes will we be able to garner a full understanding of how our genes influence our lives,' he said.           The paper concludes: 'Ultimately, as more entire genome sequences and their associated personal characteristics become available, they will facilitate a new era of research into the basis of individuality.'           Eventually, after sequencing the DNA of around 10 million people, he said, there may be true insight into the relationships between nature and nurture, providing new ways to prevent disease, opportunities for personalised medicine, and 'a deeper understanding of us as a species and our own evolution.'           Huntington Willard, a geneticist at Duke University, North Carolina, said that the quality of the new genome was 'exceptionally high' and that 'until the next genome comes along this is the gold standard right now.'           Some geneticists worry that sequencing the rich and famous is a misuse of science, with one calling it 'recreational genomics,' But scientists such as Mr Venter counter that sequencing themselves first will defuse public anxiety about the possible misuse of genomic data by insurers, employers and others.           'We have all been taught we should fear this information. We hope to teach people they should welcome it,' he said yesterday.           Venter's great rival, Jim Watson, who discovered the double helix structure of DNA more than half a century ago, has had his own genetic sequence read by 454 Life Sciences, Branford, Connecticut and the next up will probably be sequencing guru George Church of Harvard University.           Then there is the Archon X Prize in Genomics - a $10-million cash award for the first team to sequence 100 genomes in 10 days - for which Venter is co-chair of the scientific advisory board.           The prizewinner can claim a $1-million bonus by sequencing a list of 100 individuals in a given time, including people nominated by disease advocacy groups, and celebrities such as television journalist Larry King, cosmologist Stephen Hawking, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Google co-founder Larry Page and former junk-bond trader Michael Milken.

telegraph,23/04/2008 19:15,news,"A food crop has had its entire genetic code read to reveal the precise effects of genetic modification on its DNA for the first time.          The pioneering feat could be exploited to allay concerns about the effects of gene tinkering.            The SunUp papaya was created by bombarding young plants with gold particles coated in a gene that would make the resulting plants resistant to a serious pest, the ringspot virus.            Today, in the journal Nature, a team of scientists led by Prof Maqsudul Alam produces the first detailed look at the entire genetic code of the 'transgenic' plant that resulted from this gene bombardment.         The International Papaya Genome Consortium led by the University of Hawaii researcher has deciphered the genetic code of the disease-resistant SunUp papaya.         The draft plant genetic code - genome - consists of 372 million 'letters' and reveals that the insertions of new DNA occurred in only three places in the papaya genome.         This reveals the 'transgene' responsible for resistance to papaya ringspot virus and the feat shows that now it is possible to study the effects of GM in unprecedented detail.         The GM papaya was developed by the USDA Agricultural Research Service's US Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Centre and released in the mid-1990s to save Hawaii's papaya industry from collapse.         'The draft sequence will provide candidate genes for developing disease and insect resistant varieties with improved fruit quality', says Stephanie Whalen, Director of the Hawaii Agriculture Research Centre.         The Rainbow papaya, a hybrid between transgenic SunUp and non-transgenic Kapoho, is currently greater than 60 per cent of Hawaii's total papaya production and nearly 70 per cent when other transgenic varieties are included.         Currently, the transgenic papaya can be marketed in Canada and the mainland USA but not in Japan. The team says papaya genome has answered many technical questions for the Japanese regulatory agency and the transgenic 'Rainbow 'papaya may soon be available for consumption in Japan.         Comparing the genome sequence with that of a distant relative, the grass Arabidopsis, the authors find that the papaya genome is three times larger but in fact contains fewer genes - which could provide clues about the evolution of seed-producing plants.         As well as having fewer working genes than any other flowering plant for which equivalent data are available, papaya also contains more genes for volatile compounds, the odours that attract pollinators and animals that eat the fruit and disperse its seeds.         Papaya is now the fifth angiosperm (flowering plant) for which detailed genomic information is available. 'One of the implications of this study is, on a larger scale, to understand the genome evolution of angiosperms,' says Prof Ray Ming, University of Illinois.         Fruit, stem, leaves, and roots of papaya are used in a wide range of medical applications including production of papain, a valuable proteolytic enzyme.         'Sequencing the papaya genome is the first large scale genome project done in Hawaii with international collaboration from 22 research institutes and will benefit the papaya research community, papaya farmers, and consumers for years to come,' says Prof Alam, Director of the Centre for Advanced Studies in Genomics, Proteomics, and Bioinformatics, College of Natural Sciences."
telegraph,28/04/2011 05:00,news,"Potential cures for dozens of debilitating conditions are under threat from a European ruling that claims making money from embryonic stem cell research is immoral, leading scientists have warned.The academics said that a change in EU law could 'wipe out' much of   the biotechnology industry and halt work on revolutionary cures for   conditions that affect millions of people. At present Britain is a world leader in the use of stem cells thanks to   investment from the private sector and the government. Scientists are working on treatments for blindness, Alzheimer's, Parkinsons,   strokes and spinal injuries as well as coming up with an alternative to   testing new drugs on animals. But scientists say all this work could be halted – and much of it moved to   China and the US – if the European Court of Justice makes a new directive   effectively outlawing the use of human embryos for any commercial purpose. EU judges are considering a test case that could make it unlawful to patent   applications using embryonic stem cells – or anything derived from them – on   moral grounds. The academics are concerned because the judges have been told that patenting   any use of cells derived from human embryos breaches ethical principles. That recommendation was given by French judge Yves Bot, the 'advocate   general' appointed to provide reasoned, independent guidance to the   court. He has a powerful voice, and although his opinion is not binding, the court   follows his advice in eight out of 10 judgments. A European legal ban on embryonic stem cell patents will have potentially   catastrophic consequences for the multi-billion pound European biotech   industry, the UK economy, and patients, according to the scientists. It will lead to a withdrawal of funding and force patients to go abroad to get   treatments initially developed in this country. It could be potentially damaging to the health and wealth of the nation. Such is the alarm that thirteen leading researchers have written to the   journal Nature outlining their concerns. They include clone pioneer and 'Dolly the Sheep' creator Professor   Ian Wilmut, chairman of the Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine in   Edinburgh, and Professor Austin Smith, director of the Wellcome Trust Centre   for Stem Cell Research in Cambridge. Speaking at a press conference in London, Prof Smith said the advocate   general's opinion, issued in a public statement, was 'astonishing and   shocking'. He said: 'If the European Court of Justice was to follow this opinion   then the reality ... is that all patents in Europe that involve human   embryonic stem cells will be eliminated.  'Other patents will apply in the United States, China and Japan, so this   will put Europe at a huge disadvantage. It will effectively wipe out the   European biotech industry in this area.' The ruling could potentially have a massive impact on the provision of new   treatments, said the scientists. Licensing authorities would effectively be prevented from approving therapies   based on the 'immoral' commercialisation of embryonic stem cells. More than 100 patents on embryonic stem cell products have already been    in Europe. But advanced stem cell treatments are only just starting to make   the transition from the lab to the clinic. The first British trial, led by Professor Pete Coffey from University College   London, will use cells derived from embryonic stem cells to treat an   incurable form of age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease affecting   700,000 people in the UK. Two other clinical trials involving a stem cell treatment for spinal injuries   and another eye condition are in the pipe line and the stem cell pioneer   Stephen Minger is looking at ways to use them for drug screening and   toxicology Prof Coffey, one of the letter signatories, said: 'There's an ethical   need to treat disease which appears to have been lost in this whole debate.' He pointed out that obtaining permission for a clinical trial partly depended   on the likelihood of ending up with a licensable product. While 'new' embryonic stem cells are extracted from early stage   human embryos – usually surplus left overs from IVF treatment – few if any   are now used in research. Instead scientists rely on proliferating cell cultures that have been   maintained in laboratories for years. Such cells can be chemically coaxed into forming different kinds of body   tissue for use in treatments. Or they may be used as screening tools to test   the toxicity of drugs, providing an alternative to animal models. But because they originally started out as cells taken from cannibalised   embryos, they would still be affected by the European Court patent ruling. Theoretically so would any technology that can be traced back to a fertilised   human egg. The case before the European Court of Justice began as a legal battle over a   patent granted in 1999 to Professor Oliver Bruestle, from the University of   Bonn in Germany. He wanted to safeguard his method of producing nerve cell precursors from   embryonic stem cells. Prof Bruestle's patent was challenged in the German courts by the   environmental group Greenpeace in 2004. Two years later the dispute was   referred to the European Court of Justice by the German Federal Patent   Court. Prof Smith said patenting was a 'key vehicle' for the successful   transfer of stem cell research into applications that can help patients. Without the vital contribution of industry that patents made possible, the   development of stem cell therapies could virtually grind to a halt. Stem cell applications were an important part of the thinking behind the £200   million Technology and Innovation Centres set up by the Government to   produce practical solutions from academic research. The legal ruling will be made by the European Court of Justice's 'grand   chamber' of 13 judges. There is no time limit to how long they take to   reach their verdict, but typically the process takes several weeks. Once a ruling is made it will be binding on all member states. Any state that disobeys a ruling of the court can be fined. "
telegraph,2/4/2011 21:00,news,"Scientists have created genetically modified cattle that produce 'human' milk in a bid to make cows' milk more nutritious.The scientists have successfully introduced human genes into 300 dairy cows to   produce milk with the same properties as human breast milk. Human milk contains high quantities of key nutrients that can help to boost   the immune system of babies and reduce the risk of infections. The scientists behind the research believe milk from herds of genetically   modified cows could provide an alternative to human breast milk and formula   milk for babies, which is often criticised as being an inferior substitute. They hope genetically modified dairy products from herds of similar cows could   be sold in supermarkets. The research has the backing of a major   biotechnology company. The work is likely to inflame opposition to GM foods. Critics of the   technology and animal welfare groups reacted angrily to the research,   questioning the safety of milk from genetically modified animals and its   effect on the cattle's health. But Professor Ning Li, the scientist who led the research and director of the   State Key Laboratories for AgroBiotechnology at the China Agricultural   University insisted that the GM milk would be as safe to drink as milk from   ordinary dairy cows. He said: 'The milk tastes stronger than normal milk. “We aim to commercialize some research in this area in coming three years. For   the “human-like milk”, 10 years or maybe more time will be required to   finally pour this enhanced milk into the consumer’s cup.”China is now leading the way in research   on genetically modified food and the rules on the technology are more   relaxed than those in place in Europe. The researchers used cloning technology to introduce human genes into the DNA   of Holstein dairy cows before the genetically modified embryos were   implanted into surrogate cows. Writing in the scientific peer-reviewed journal Public Library of Science One,   the researchers said they were able to create cows that produced milk   containing a human protein called lysozyme, Lysozyme is an antimicrobial protein naturally found in large quantities in   human breast milk. It helps to protect infants from bacterial infections   during their early days of life. They created cows that produce another protein from human milk called   lactoferrin, which helps to boost the numbers of immune cells in babies. A   third human milk protein called alpha-lactalbumin was also produced by the   cows. The scientists also revealed at an exhibition at the China Agricultural   University that they have boosted milk fat content by around 20 per cent and   have also changed the levels of milk solids, making it closer to the   composition of human milk as well as having the same immune-boosting   properties. Professor Li and his colleagues, who have been working with the Beijing   GenProtein Biotechnology Company, said their work has shown it was possible   to 'humanise' cows milk. In all, the scientists said they have produced a herd of around 300 cows that   are able to produce human-like milk. The transgenic animals are physically identical to ordinary cows. Writing in the journal, Professor Li said: 'Our study describes   transgenic cattle whose milk offers the similar nutritional benefits as   human milk. 'The modified bovine milk is a possible substitute for human milk. It   fulfilled the conception of humanising the bovine milk.'Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph, he added the “human-like milk” would   provide “much higher nutritional content”. He said they had managed to   produce three generations of GM cows but for commercial production there   would need to be large numbers of cows produced. He said: “Human milk contains the ‘just right’ proportions of protein,   carbohydrates, fats, minerals, and vitamins for an infant’s optimal growth   and development. “As our daily food, the cow’s milk provided us the basic source of nutrition.   But the digestion and absorption problems made it not the perfect food for   human being.'The researchers also insist having antimicrobial proteins in the cows milk can   also be good for the animals by helping to reduce infections of their   udders. Genetically modified food has become a highly controversial subject and   currently they can only be sold in the UK and Europe if they have passed   extensive safety testing. The consumer response to GM food has also been highly negative, resulting in   many supermarkets seeking to source products that are GM free. Campaigners claim GM technology poses a threat to the environment as genes   from modified plants can get into wild plant populations and weeds, while   they also believe there are doubts about the safety of such foods. Scientists insist genetically modified foods are unlikely to pose a threat to   food safety and in the United States consumers have been eating genetically   modified foods for more decades. However, during two experiments by the Chinese researchers, which resulted in   42 transgenic calves being born, just 26 of the animals survived after ten   died shortly after birth, most with gastrointestinal disease, and a further   six died within six months of birth. Researchers accept that the cloning technology used in genetic modification   can affect the development and survival of cloned animals, although the   reason why is not well understood. A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals said the   organisation was 'extremely concerned' about how the GM cows had   been produced. She said: 'Offspring of cloned animals often suffer health and welfare   problems, so this would be a grave concern. 'Why do we need this milk – what is it giving us that we haven't already   got.'Helen Wallace, director of biotechnology monitoring group GeneWatch UK, said: 'We   have major concerns about this research to genetically modify cows with   human genes. 'There are major welfare issues with genetically modified animals as you   get high numbers of still births. 'There is a question about whether milk from these cows is going to be   safe from humans and it is really hard to tell that unless you do large   clinical trials like you would a drug, so there will be uncertainty about   whether it could be harmful to some people. 'Ethically there are issues about mass producing animals in this way.'Professor Keith Campbell, a biologist at the University of Nottingham works   with transgenic animals, said: 'Genetically modified animals and plants   are not going to be harmful unless you deliberately put in a gene that is   going to be poisonous. Why would anyone do that in a food? 'Genetically modified food, if done correctly, can provide huge benefit   for consumers in terms of producing better products.'"
telegraph,5/10/2011 19:25,news,"Scientists have for the first time used a cloning technique to get tailor-made embryonic stem cells to grow in human egg cells.The development in New York marks a landmark in stem cell research, according   to experts in the field, but also represents a potential new flashpoint for   opponents of such controversial cell research. The researchers were trying to prove it is possible to use a cloning   technology called somatic cell nuclear transfer, or SCNT, to make embryonic   stem cells that match a patient's DNA. The achievement, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, is   significant because such patient-specific cells potentially can be   transplanted to replace damaged cells in people with diabetes and other   diseases without rejection by the immune system. This technique could ignite new controversy because some opponents consider it   to be cloning, which they fiercely oppose. 'This paper will be seen as significant both by those who are trying to   use SCNT to produce human patient-specific embryonic stem cell lines and by   those who oppose human 'cloning' experiments,' said Professor Robin   Lovell-Badge, a division head at Britain's National Institute for Medical   Research. Stem cells are the body's master cells, the source material for all other   cells. Proponents of embryonic stem cells say they could transform medicine,   providing treatments for blindness, juvenile diabetes or severe injuries. Normally, SCNT involves removing genetic material from the nucleus of the host   egg cell and replacing it with the nucleus from adult cells, the technique   used to clone animals such as Dolly the sheep in 1996. But scientists so far   have failed to get these cells to grow and divide beyond a very early stage   in humans and non-human primates. Scientists in this study, led by Dieter Egli and Scott Noggle at The New York   Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory in New York, kept the genetic material from   the host egg and simply added the nucleus from the adult cells. 'Rather surprisingly - as this means that they are creating an embryo   with too many copies of each chromosome - these constructs developed well   and efficiently to the blastocyst stage (the stage just before implantation,   where the embryo is about 80 to 100 cells),' Lovell-Badge said in a   statement. She said the result falls short because the scientists did not obtain useful   cell lines, but they may help explain why other techniques have failed. 'This study shows that the conventional approach to somatic cell nuclear   transfer is inefficient in humans,' said Professor Mary Herbert of   Newcastle University and Newcastle Fertility Centre. 'While this approach does not in itself provide a solution, it takes us a   step closer to understanding where the problems lie,' Herbert said. He said the latest study offers a new approach that may allow scientists to   compare different techniques of creating these important and powerful cells. Embryonic stem cells are made from embryos that are just a few days old, but   have been a point of controversy for some religious conservatives, who   believe the destruction of any human embryo is wrong. Scientists typically harvest embryonic stem cells from embryos leftover at   fertility clinics, but the eggs in this study came from women who were paid   around $8,000, roughly the same rate women are paid for egg donations for   in-vitro fertilization. Scientists have debated whether researchers should pay women for eggs used in   stem cell research for fear the payments would act as an inducement to women   to donate their eggs, a procedure and can take weeks, can cause discomfort   and has some risk. The goal of these studies is to work out the best ways to create cells that   are 'pluripotent' - meaning they can be used to form any other   kind of cell in the body. Embryonic stem cells have this capability, but these cells cannot be tailored   to match a specific patient's DNA, and treatments made from these cells   might face rejection from the body, much like transplanted organs. In 2006, scientists discovered a new way creating embryonic-like stem cells in   the lab using patients' own skin cells and a potent mix of genes or 'factors'   that can turn back the clock on the adult cells, restoring them to a   pluripotent state. 'The goal is to create customized or personalized stem cells that match a   particular patient,' said Dr. George Daley of the Harvard Stem Cell   Institute and Harvard Medical School in a telephone interview. But recently, several groups of scientists, including Daley's lab, have found   that these iPS cells are not exactly the same as embryonic stem cells. 'We are just beginning to learn about this kind of iPS cell. It turns out   they harbor a number of genetic problems,' Daley said. He said the latest study offers a new approach that may allow scientists to   compare different techniques of creating these important and powerful cells. Professor Chris Mason, Chair of Regenerative Medicine Bioprocessing,   University College London, said the study adds to the growing number of   options for future cell therapies. 'Which approach is the best? Only time will tell, but multiple routes   forward may eventually speed the delivery of cell therapies for a broad   range of unmet clinical needs.'The study was backed solely by private funding and followed ethical guidelines   adopted by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the   International Society for Stem Cell Research. The research was done in the New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory in New   York in collaboration with doctors and researchers at Columbia University   Medical Center, whose institutional review board and stem cell committees   reviewed and approved the study protocols.

telegraph,21/10/2004 00:01,news,"The death of Christopher Reeve has re-ignited the debate over stem-cell research. And John Edwards, the Democrat vice-presidential candidate has all but said that President Bush is personally responsible for the Superman actor not finding a way to walk again.          Here, two of our columnists contest the issue.                     For - Alasdair Palmer                  The last time I wrote about multiple sclerosis I received a letter from a charming 'old' lady (that's how she described herself) which started: 'Dear Mr Palmer, Why don't you just die? There's nothing anyone can do to help you. What you've got is incurable and it's a complete waste of the NHS's time and money to spend anything on trying to cure you. The doctors shouldn't bother.'          It was not the sort of letter to lift a man's spirits, but my correspondent was right about one thing: MS belongs to the category of diseases - which includes Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, and a range of heart conditions - for which there is no cure. The best that can be hoped from the existing treatments is to slow the degeneration brought on by the progress of the illness.          Research into therapies that use stem cells may have the potential to provide cures for a whole range of debilitating, crippling and frequently fatal ailments. Stem cells have the ability to develop into any of the 200 different kinds of cell that make up the human body. The existing studies suggest that it is possible for stem cells, if injected into a patient, to seek out and replace the damaged cells that are the cause of so many diseases: nerve cells in the case of multiple sclerosis, brain cells with Alzheimer's, blood and heart vessels in the case of heart disease, and so on.          Stem cells can be derived from adults: there are extractable stem cells among the cells that make up your skin and among those that make up your hair follicles, brain and bone marrow. The problem with adult-derived stem cells is that the repertoire of cell types that they can be persuaded to become is very restricted.          This is not true of stem cells derived from two-day-old embryos. Those embryos are each made up of between four and eight completely undifferentiated cells which can develop into any cell type. One source for such stem cells is the procedure of in vitro fertilisation. Only two of the 10 or so embryos created in a Petri dish during each episode of in vitro fertilisation will be implanted back in the woman who hopes to become a mother. The remaining eight are then frequently just thrown away.          One alternative to discarding them is to use them to create stem cells. The process requires allowing the embryo to develop over a further five days into what is called a blastocyst, isolating the blastocyst's 20 or 50 stem cells, and then mixing them with a catalyst that will cause them to reproduce - which, if the conditions are right, they will do prodigiously. Dr Miodrag Stojkovic of the Life Centre at Newcastle University explains that, in his lab, 'We have managed to get a billion stem cells from cells taken from a single blastocyst.'          The next stage is to cause stem cells to develop into the required kind of cell - nerve cells, blood cells, brain cells, liver cells, or whatever, according to the disease to be tackled. Those differentiated cells would then be injected into a patient to effect a 'cell transplant'. The hoped-for result would be replacement of damaged cells by ones which function properly, and so cure the illness.          The use of blastocysts for stem-cell research is the source of controversy. It is not easy to understand why. As Dr Stojkovic says: 'Opponents of stem-cell research say that they would ban it because it involves the destruction of life. But what do they propose to do with the three-day embryos? Throw them away.          There is no chance of in vitro fertilisation being made illegal, for the very good reason that in vitro fertilisation is a procedure that has created, over the past 25 years, thousands of healthy people who would otherwise not exist. As a society, we have accepted the creation of embryos in labs, and it is very tightly regulated in Britain. But it is surely better that the cells from the embryos are not discarded, but used in a way which could help humanity.'          That consideration has started to have some persuasive effect, even in America, where a growing number of those vehemently opposed to abortion have come to believe that President Bush's ban on federal funding for research that involves stem cells derived from embryos is a mistake.          'The American position is intellectually incoherent,' argues Professor Chris Higgins, the director of the MRC's Clinical Science Centre, 'because while they ban government-funded labs from using stem cells, they allow privately funded institutions to do pretty much what they like with them. This to me is the clearest indication that American government's opposition derives from political considerations, not from deeply-held moral convictions. If American politicians sincerely believed stem-cell research was a form of child-murder, they would ban it altogether.'          Stem-cell research is a very recent branch of medicine: six or seven years ago, it was almost totally unknown. Today, there are 50 or 60 research centres. Although the animal studies on the effectiveness of stem-cell therapies have been enormously promising, as have the few cases that have been attempted in human beings, it is still far too early to pronounce definitively on the viability of stem-cell therapy.          Cell-replacement therapy using stem cells may turn out to be both safe and effective. On the other hand, it may turn out not to be. No one yet knows. The only way to find out is to do the research. Not to do it at all because of a dogmatic prior conviction that it cannot work is to take, towards me and the millions worldwide with currently incurable diseases, the attitude of that charming old lady: 'It's a complete waste of the NHS's time and money to spend anything on trying to cure you. The doctors shouldn't bother.'                      Against - Dr James Le Fanu                  It is easy to see - and, indeed, you are expected to do so - the current controversy over the use of human embryos in stem-cell research as yet another skirmish in the time-honoured conflict between the forces of reasoned, progressive 'humanitarian' science versus its antithesis - reactionary, moralistic religion.          How else to explain that idiot George W Bush's unwavering opposition, punishable by a fine of $1 million or a 10-year prison sentence, to a form of research that promises so much? It has the potential to cure not just the late Christopher Reeve's spine but to restore the lost memories of those with Alzheimer's, the ability of those with Parkinson's, to permit diabetics to throw away their syringes and much else besides.          Surely, if there is a moral issue here, then the contra-argument that this type of research involves the exploitation of human embryos as a tool for other ends is more than countered by that in favour, the imperative, wherever possible, to minimise human suffering.          But George W and his Christian fundamentalist friends could be shrewder and more knowledgeable about this than we give them credit for. His views might, for example, reflect his antipathy towards self-publicising scientists peddling fairy stories. Their promises of salvation, where disease and suffering will be abolished, the blind will see and the lame will walk, he might think, are a smokescreen to conceal the flaws and failings and singular lack of progress in current biomedical research.          I have, of course, no way of knowing whether this is indeed George W's position - but, if it is, then the following will be grist to his mill.          First, the extravagant promises of the proposed benefits of stem-cell research are highly suspicious, encompassing, as they do, virtually every outstanding unsolved problem in medicine. It would be a different matter if there was much to show for the genetic hype of the past couple of decades - but there is not, its practical benefits being scarcely visible.          Genetic engineering has proved to be an expensive way of making unnecessary drugs; genetic screening has proved impractical and gene therapy does not work. It must thus seem highly improbable that this latest wheeze will, as promised, cure Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, etc, etc.          The next question is whether the current status of this research is such that it might prove of value, not now perhaps, but at some indefinite point in the future. This is clearly too technical a matter to be dealt with here, but a recent review in Scientific American - The Stem Cell Challenge, by Robert Lanza and Nadia Rosental (June 2004, pp61-67) - is scarcely encouraging.          Put briefly and bluntly, there is no reliable method of identifying stem cells in the first place, nor of getting them to differentiate into the required types of nerve or muscle cells, or whatever, nor of accurately placing them at the site of damaged tissue in heart, brain or spinal cord, nor of ensuring they function effectively. Thus, even were these (at the moment insuperable) obstacles to be overcome, the problem would still remain that there is no way of getting embryo-derived nerve cells to link up with and 'talk' to the millions of others running up and down the spinal cord.          Then it is necessary to point out that we have been here before, back in the 1980s, when scientists were promising that experiments on human embryos, investigating early patterns of growth, would solve an entirely different shopping list of medical problems, prevent 4,000 inherited diseases, create perfect babies and similar nonsense. Well, it has not, and never could have and for reasons that take us to the heart of this controversy.          Science is, and always will be, the art of the soluble, which, in medical research, means starting with some drug or technique of proven worth and then investigating its potential through well-planned, humane animal experiments before seeing whether it might work in humans. This clearly has not been the pattern with stem-cell research. Rather, the necessary preliminary steps have been bypassed in favour of a campaign to permit scientists to investigate their value in humans. And why? It must be that the protagonists believe correctly that the resultant controversy will generate the right sort of coverage and publicity for themselves from which they will emerge as brilliant and dedicated scientists thwarted in their attempts to save mankind.          George W, to his credit, does not buy it. Rather, recognising the unique status of the human embryo as the most profoundly mysterious phenomenon in the universe, he has insisted it should not be experimented on without good reason. And, with all due respect to the late Christopher Reeve's good faith and passionate campaigning on this issue, I'm sure the President is absolutely right."

Here, two of our columnists contest the issue.         For - Alasdair Palmer         The last time I wrote about multiple sclerosis I received a letter from a charming 'old' lady (that's how she described herself) which started: 'Dear Mr Palmer, Why don't you just die? There's nothing anyone can do to help you. What you've got is incurable and it's a complete waste of the NHS's time and money to spend anything on trying to cure you. The doctors shouldn't bother.'          It was not the sort of letter to lift a man's spirits, but my correspondent was right about one thing: MS belongs to the category of diseases - which includes Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, and a range of heart conditions - for which there is no cure. The best that can be hoped from the existing treatments is to slow the degeneration brought on by the progress of the illness.          Research into therapies that use stem cells may have the potential to provide cures for a whole range of debilitating, crippling and frequently fatal ailments. Stem cells have the ability to develop into any of the 200 different kinds of cell that make up the human body. The existing studies suggest that it is possible for stem cells, if injected into a patient, to seek out and replace the damaged cells that are the cause of so many diseases: nerve cells in the case of multiple sclerosis, brain cells with Alzheimer's, blood and heart vessels in the case of heart disease, and so on.          Stem cells can be derived from adults: there are extractable stem cells among the cells that make up your skin and among those that make up your hair follicles, brain and bone marrow. The problem with adult-derived stem cells is that the repertoire of cell types that they can be persuaded to become is very restricted.          This is not true of stem cells derived from two-day-old embryos. Those embryos are each made up of between four and eight completely undifferentiated cells which can develop into any cell type. One source for such stem cells is the procedure of in vitro fertilisation. Only two of the 10 or so embryos created in a Petri dish during each episode of in vitro fertilisation will be implanted back in the woman who hopes to become a mother. The remaining eight are then frequently just thrown away.          One alternative to discarding them is to use them to create stem cells. The process requires allowing the embryo to develop over a further five days into what is called a blastocyst, isolating the blastocyst's 20 or 50 stem cells, and then mixing them with a catalyst that will cause them to reproduce - which, if the conditions are right, they will do prodigiously. Dr Miodrag Stojkovic of the Life Centre at Newcastle University explains that, in his lab, 'We have managed to get a billion stem cells from cells taken from a single blastocyst.'          The next stage is to cause stem cells to develop into the required kind of cell - nerve cells, blood cells, brain cells, liver cells, or whatever, according to the disease to be tackled. Those differentiated cells would then be injected into a patient to effect a 'cell transplant'. The hoped-for result would be replacement of damaged cells by ones which function properly, and so cure the illness.          The use of blastocysts for stem-cell research is the source of controversy. It is not easy to understand why. As Dr Stojkovic says: 'Opponents of stem-cell research say that they would ban it because it involves the destruction of life. But what do they propose to do with the three-day embryos? Throw them away.          There is no chance of in vitro fertilisation being made illegal, for the very good reason that in vitro fertilisation is a procedure that has created, over the past 25 years, thousands of healthy people who would otherwise not exist. As a society, we have accepted the creation of embryos in labs, and it is very tightly regulated in Britain. But it is surely better that the cells from the embryos are not discarded, but used in a way which could help humanity.'          That consideration has started to have some persuasive effect, even in America, where a growing number of those vehemently opposed to abortion have come to believe that President Bush's ban on federal funding for research that involves stem cells derived from embryos is a mistake.          'The American position is intellectually incoherent,' argues Professor Chris Higgins, the director of the MRC's Clinical Science Centre, 'because while they ban government-funded labs from using stem cells, they allow privately funded institutions to do pretty much what they like with them. This to me is the clearest indication that American government's opposition derives from political considerations, not from deeply-held moral convictions. If American politicians sincerely believed stem-cell research was a form of child-murder, they would ban it altogether.'          Stem-cell research is a very recent branch of medicine: six or seven years ago, it was almost totally unknown. Today, there are 50 or 60 research centres. Although the animal studies on the effectiveness of stem-cell therapies have been enormously promising, as have the few cases that have been attempted in human beings, it is still far too early to pronounce definitively on the viability of stem-cell therapy.          Cell-replacement therapy using stem cells may turn out to be both safe and effective. On the other hand, it may turn out not to be. No one yet knows. The only way to find out is to do the research. Not to do it at all because of a dogmatic prior conviction that it cannot work is to take, towards me and the millions worldwide with currently incurable diseases, the attitude of that charming old lady: 'It's a complete waste of the NHS's time and money to spend anything on trying to cure you. The doctors shouldn't bother.'          Against - Dr James Le Fanu         It is easy to see - and, indeed, you are expected to do so - the current controversy over the use of human embryos in stem-cell research as yet another skirmish in the time-honoured conflict between the forces of reasoned, progressive 'humanitarian' science versus its antithesis - reactionary, moralistic religion.          How else to explain that idiot George W Bush's unwavering opposition, punishable by a fine of $1 million or a 10-year prison sentence, to a form of research that promises so much? It has the potential to cure not just the late Christopher Reeve's spine but to restore the lost memories of those with Alzheimer's, the ability of those with Parkinson's, to permit diabetics to throw away their syringes and much else besides.          Surely, if there is a moral issue here, then the contra-argument that this type of research involves the exploitation of human embryos as a tool for other ends is more than countered by that in favour, the imperative, wherever possible, to minimise human suffering.          But George W and his Christian fundamentalist friends could be shrewder and more knowledgeable about this than we give them credit for. His views might, for example, reflect his antipathy towards self-publicising scientists peddling fairy stories. Their promises of salvation, where disease and suffering will be abolished, the blind will see and the lame will walk, he might think, are a smokescreen to conceal the flaws and failings and singular lack of progress in current biomedical research.          I have, of course, no way of knowing whether this is indeed George W's position - but, if it is, then the following will be grist to his mill.          First, the extravagant promises of the proposed benefits of stem-cell research are highly suspicious, encompassing, as they do, virtually every outstanding unsolved problem in medicine. It would be a different matter if there was much to show for the genetic hype of the past couple of decades - but there is not, its practical benefits being scarcely visible.          Genetic engineering has proved to be an expensive way of making unnecessary drugs; genetic screening has proved impractical and gene therapy does not work. It must thus seem highly improbable that this latest wheeze will, as promised, cure Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, etc, etc.          The next question is whether the current status of this research is such that it might prove of value, not now perhaps, but at some indefinite point in the future. This is clearly too technical a matter to be dealt with here, but a recent review in Scientific American - The Stem Cell Challenge, by Robert Lanza and Nadia Rosental (June 2004, pp61-67) - is scarcely encouraging.          Put briefly and bluntly, there is no reliable method of identifying stem cells in the first place, nor of getting them to differentiate into the required types of nerve or muscle cells, or whatever, nor of accurately placing them at the site of damaged tissue in heart, brain or spinal cord, nor of ensuring they function effectively. Thus, even were these (at the moment insuperable) obstacles to be overcome, the problem would still remain that there is no way of getting embryo-derived nerve cells to link up with and 'talk' to the millions of others running up and down the spinal cord.          Then it is necessary to point out that we have been here before, back in the 1980s, when scientists were promising that experiments on human embryos, investigating early patterns of growth, would solve an entirely different shopping list of medical problems, prevent 4,000 inherited diseases, create perfect babies and similar nonsense. Well, it has not, and never could have and for reasons that take us to the heart of this controversy.          Science is, and always will be, the art of the soluble, which, in medical research, means starting with some drug or technique of proven worth and then investigating its potential through well-planned, humane animal experiments before seeing whether it might work in humans. This clearly has not been the pattern with stem-cell research. Rather, the necessary preliminary steps have been bypassed in favour of a campaign to permit scientists to investigate their value in humans. And why? It must be that the protagonists believe correctly that the resultant controversy will generate the right sort of coverage and publicity for themselves from which they will emerge as brilliant and dedicated scientists thwarted in their attempts to save mankind.          George W, to his credit, does not buy it. Rather, recognising the unique status of the human embryo as the most profoundly mysterious phenomenon in the universe, he has insisted it should not be experimented on without good reason. And, with all due respect to the late Christopher Reeve's good faith and passionate campaigning on this issue, I'm sure the President is absolutely right."
telegraph,18/06/2007 14:00,news,"            Researchers around the world are relieved to find they are talking about the same cells, reports Roger Highfield                  Stem cell scientists around the world who are attempting to develop the next generation of medical treatments will breathe a collective sigh of relief today after a major survey has concluded that they have indeed been studying the same thing.          Stem cells are parent cells of all 200 types in the body and since the first human embryonic stem cells were isolated in America a decade ago, a race has been on to isolate them and find reliable ways to turn them into nerve cells, muscle cells and a range of other types to repair a body ravaged by illness.          But there have been nagging doubts that the stem cells grown in one laboratory are not quite the same as those in another, not helped by how differed techniques are used to isolate the cells from different human embryos.         In addition, practices differ among labs and these master cells are defined by various tests, such as the ability to form tumours called teratomas, which consist of a blend of many cell types, or display specific marker proteins on their surfaces.          Now more than 80 leading scientists from around the world have shared their knowledge about human embryonic stem cell lines, part of the International Stem Cell Initiative, and carefully studied 59 lines of human embryonic stem cells in a comparable way.          The results of the £500,000 study, which involved the cells from 17 laboratories from 11 different countries being studied under standardised conditions, are published in Nature Biotechnology and conclude that, aside from some minor variations, they have indeed been looking at the same cells, said Prof Peter Andrews of Sheffield University, who is leading the initiative.          He said that researchers in this burgeoning field will be 'greatly relieved' by the findings. 'It could have come out that there were much more dramatic differences. But we were struck by the similarities.'          'The key result from our point of view was the extent to which all the lines, whether old or new, expressed similar 'signatures' of key markers. Before we did this comparative study there really was no way to be sure whether all the lines that have been reported around the world really were more or less the same thing or whether there were significantly different subsets of lines.          The team has now been able to draw up a set of characteristics to provide an agreed global stem cell standard for future studies. 'We have a standard set of stem cell markers,' he said.          However, Prof Andrews admitted the study has not removed all doubts because it, in effect, only took a snapshot of the cells and there is still a chance that different lines could develop differently in the lab, since some proteins linked with development did behave slightly differently, in some lines, depending on the stem cells. With another £1 million from the International Stem Cell Forum, this feature will now be studied in follow up research.          The Chief Executive of the UK Medical Research Council, Prof Colin Blakemore, commented: 'The potential of stem cell research is great. We hope stem cell science will lead to the treatment of all manner of illnesses, from diabetes to multiple sclerosis.         'By creating this registry and making it freely available, the ISCI will not only be a great resource for scientists across the world, but will set the tone for the collaborative spirit in which we hope research will continue to be carried out, for the benefit of the many, not the few.'          Three labs in the UK have contributed stem cell lines to the project: the Centre for Stem Cell Research at the University of Sheffield, the Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, King's College London, and the International Centre for Life, Newcastle University."
telegraph,20/09/2007 12:00,news,"            Roger Highfield describes how men are sitting on a rich new source of stem cells                   Stem cells found in a male patient's testicles might someday be used to create a range of tissue types to help him fight disease and to stay fertile, while sidestepping the controversial use of stem cells from human embryos.           A tiny sample of the testicle cells could be grown indefinitely in the lab and coaxed to form a wide range of types found in the body, suggesting more flexibility than other sources of stem cells found in the adult body, notably bone marrow.           Although there are some technical hurdles left to overcome, the 'breakthrough study' in mice led by Prof Shahin Rafii's team at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City is reported in the journal Nature.           The team seems to have overcome concerns about the scarcity of adult stem cells, and possible inflexibility, to grow large quantities in the lab to form blood vessels and beating heart cells.           'These unique specialised cells could be an easily obtained and manipulated source of stem cells with exactly the same capability to form new tissues that we see in embryonic stem cells,' he said.         'We hope this seminal paper will set the stage for designing clinical strategies for regenerating failing organs in patients with heart disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, macular degeneration (the most common cause of blindness) and infertility induced by chemotherapy and irradiation.'           Others have grown these testes stem cells - spermatogonial progenitor stem cells (the precursors to sperm, also called SPCs) - in the lab before.         Researchers have found a molecular marker that enables them to easily identify and enrich these cell to the point that they can be turned into 'multi-potent adult spermatogonial-derived stem cells' (MASCs) and then into working blood vessel (endothelial) cells and tissue, as well as cardiac cells, brain cells and a host of other cell types.         'We can get grams and grams of tissue,' Prof Rafii said.           The advance in growing the testicle cells for experiments in the lab was made by his colleague, Dr Marco Seandel at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York City.         'One problem with working with SPCs is that they've been extremely difficult to identify. We discovered that, within the testicular environment, only SPCs express a particular marker called GPR125,' Dr Seandel said          'That's a quantum leap forward in terms of being able to harvest and work with these cells.'           'That really allowed us to go full steam ahead in examining the potential of these very interesting cells,' explained Prof Rafii.           Using a blend of helper cells and growth factors they could divert the stem cells away from creating sperm and towards what scientists called 'multipotency'- the ability to develop into many different cell types.         'We took them furthest when it came to endothelial cells,' says Dr Daylon James, a co-author.         'In experiments in live mouse tissue, we were able to show that these MASC-derived endothelial cells did more than just form - they also joined up with, and functioned alongside, other blood vessels.'           The stem cells also produced contractile 'beating heart' cardiac cells, neurons, and muscle cells in the laboratory, the researchers add. 'Some hurdles remain, of course,' said Prof Rafii.           One issue concerns a process called imprinting - where only a mother or father's copy of a gene is used - is wiped clean, and this could have implications for how the cells develop into other types, with cancer one potential side effect.           'We have to replicate these findings in humans, and we haven't discovered the exact 'switch' that would allow us to control MASC development on demand,' he added.           But if overcome: 'For male patients, it could someday mean a readily available source of stem cells that gets around ethical issues linked to embryonic stem cells. It also avoids issues linked to tissue transplant rejection, since these 'autologous stem cells' are derived from the patient's own body.'           An oncologist, Prof Rafii observed noticed that a large number of patients with testicular cancer develop tumours called teratomas, which contain different types of tissue. Based on these observations, he reasoned that spermatogonia, whose sole function is to generate the precursors to sperm, have the potential to readily give rise to many cell types.           'Any addition to the growing list of stem cells that have both research and therapeutic potential is always excellent news and it is an added benefit if they can be obtained from the patients, even if, as in this case these will only be males,' commented Dr Robin Lovell-Badge of the National Institute for Medical Research, London.         'However, I disagree that these have fewer ethical problems than embryonic stem cells - if they are equally able to give all cell types of the body then any concern as to their potential use will be exactly the same.         'And one could argue that a source of benefit only to half the population is discrimination.'"
telegraph,7/5/2008 0:01,news,"            The genetics of the duck billed platypus reveal that the creature is as bizarre as it looks, writes Roger Highfield.                  Glennie the Duck billed platypus is about to enter the history books by being the first to have her DNA code cracked, revealing that the genetics of the species is as weird as the platypus itself.                                                       What flavour is the word 'platypus'?                                                                        Global warming puts koalas under threat                                                                              The creature looks part bird, part reptile, part mammal. Now researchers have found that it is equally mixed up at the genetic level in research that could help preserve the species, which is exquisitely sensitive to environmental change, and even understand what it means to be human, since we shared a common ancestor tens of millions of years ago.           The platypus is a furry mammal with webbed feet that rears its young with milk, like a cow.         Yet it lays eggs and has reptile like features: its duck-like bill houses an electrosensory system for foraging underwater, when it swims with its eyes, ears and nostrils closed.            Males also possess spurs on their hind legs that can deliver venom powerful enough to wound love rivals in the mating season.           Now the genetic secrets of Glennie, from New South Wales, have been laid bare, revealing these diverse characteristics are mirrored by a patchwork of genes resembling those from reptiles, birds and other mammals.            The discovery is reported today in the journal Nature by Prof Chris Ponting's team at the Medical Research Council Functional Genomics Unit in Oxford, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute in Cambridge and the Genome Sequencing Centre of Washington University School of Medicine, as part of an international collaboration including scientists from Australia.                        The analysis is useful for human medicine because we share a common ancestor with the platypus that lived approximately 170 million years ago.            Prof Ponting from the MRC Functional Genomics Unit at the University of Oxford, says it represents: 'the missing link in our understanding of how we and other mammals first evolved. This is our ticket back in time to when all mammals laid eggs while suckling their young on milk. It also provides an essential background to future advances in understanding mammalian biology and evolution.'            Dr Ewan Birney, who led the analysis effort at the European Bioinformatics Institute, commented: 'The platypus looks like such a strange blend of mammalian, bird-like and reptilian features and now we know that the genome is an equally bizarre mix of all of these. It's much more of a mélange than anyone expected.'         The study shows that platypus venom is a cocktail of proteins that originally had very different functions, such as fighting infection by microbes. Amazingly, the same proteins are also found in reptile venom even though platypus and snake venom evolved independently, converging on the same solution to how to defend themselves.            They also found that the platypus has many more sex chromosomes - the organised structures into which DNA is packed that determine sex - than do humans.          We have two sex chromosomes (X and the Y, where women have a pair of X chromosomes, and men have one X and one Y chromosome).            The platypus, meanwhile, has 10: the female has five different pairs of X chromosomes, while males have five X chromosomes and five Y chromosomes.          Moreover, some platypus sex chromosomes are similar to those in birds, whereas others are more alike those in mammals.            'The biggest surprise for me was that platypuses do sex like a bird, not like other mammals,' says co-author Prof Jenny Graves, Australian National University.            The Y chromosome has a gene, SRY, which leads to male characteristics. 'We expected that platypus – although they had slightly weird looking sex chromosomes - be basically the same. But they're absolutely not. There's no copy of this gene.'           'The platypus of course is not an evolutionary intermediate,' she adds. 'The platypus is a platypus. But it's the comparisons of humans with the platypus that can tell us about the fork in the road, when the platypus went one way and we went another way.'           To shed light on evolution the genome of the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) was compared with those from human, mouse, dog, opossum and chicken, as well as the draft genome sequence of the green anole lizard.            'Comparisons of the platypus genome to those of other mammals will provide new insights into the history, structure and function of our own genome,' adds Dr Francis Collins, director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute.          'The platypus appears as if it was the result of an evolutionary accident. But as weird as this animal looks, its genome sequence is priceless for understanding how fundamental mammalian biological processes have evolved.'           The platypus genome contains about the same number of protein-coding genes as other mammals - approximately 18,500.          The platypus also shares more than 80 percent of its genes with other mammals whose genomes had previously been sequenced. Interestingly, the platypus genome contains both reptilian and mammalian genes associated with the fertilization of eggs.          However, researchers discovered that, like other mammals, the platypus genome also contains a tightly clustered set of genes that produce the casein proteins that make up milk.  A good sense of smell is something most mammals have in common.          However, the platypus shuts its nostrils when foraging for food in water, so it came as a surprise that its genome showed many more smell receptors than previously seen in any other mammal.          These so-called 'vomeronasal receptors' may help the platypus to sense their aquatic environment. Access to these receptors appears to be through the back of the mouth, an arrangement seen in other aquatic mammals such as the hippopotamus.           The platypus was also chosen as the subject of this study because of concerns about the future of the platypus in its indigenous habitat, Australia.          Platypuses are shy by nature and there has been little success in breeding the animals while in captivity. Researchers hope that some of the clues unearthed in platypus DNA might lead to new directions in conservation efforts.           Dr Melody Serena, conservation biologist with the Australian Platypus Conservancy, says: 'The past decade of drought in south eastern Australia has certainly reduced platypus numbers in many areas.          'The species is also under pressure from widespread habitat degradation, water pollution, and mortality due to animals becoming entangled in litter or drowning in illegal fishing nets.          'It is essential that effective conservation measures for the platypus be initiated now, before numbers are reduced to critical levels.'"
telegraph,8/4/2012 7:20,news,"A British laboratory is working with the boss behind Europe's largest stem cell clinic, which was shut down following the death of a child in its care.For the incurably ill, it is a message of hope: for a fee of between £10,000   and £40,000, sufferers of illnesses such as heart disease, Parkinson's,   autism and cerebral palsy can buy themselves hope at Cells4health's clinic. The website is slickly designed, alluringly upbeat and carefully phrased. “Despite the huge advances which have been made recently, there is no   guarantee for the success of stem cell therapy,” it says, which is medically   true. But the next sentence is more concerning: “Nevertheless, every week we see   this new 'medicine’ helping a lot of people and improving the quality of   life of many patients.”What the website does not mention is that Cells4health is the latest business   venture of a Dutch scientist – Dr Cornelis Kleinbloesem – whose last venture   in Germany was   forced to close down in the wake of the death of a child injected with   stem cells into his brain. Cells4health uses the same techniques. Its predecessor, the XCell-Center, was   accused of preying on vulnerable patients, desperate for a cure and willing   to pay huge sums for untested treatments.  Dr Kleinbloesem’s latest enterprise could not function without help. In   Beirut, his team of doctors extract bone marrow, in which can be found the   stem cells that are capable of repairing damaged cells elsewhere in the   body. But for Dr Kleinbloesem to turn the bone marrow into stem cells he   needs outside laboratory help. And so it was that at the end of last year, Dr Kleinbloesem telephoned Husein   Salem, a respected scientist who a year previously had launched his own stem   cell company, Precious Cells International. The deal was simple. For a fee, a patient’s bone marrow is flown to Heathrow   then driven the short distance to Precious Cells’ base on the campus of   Brunel University in Uxbridge, west London. There in a laboratory, visited by The Sunday Telegraph, the stem cells   are extracted from the bone marrow and sent back to Lebanon for re-injection   into the patient. “We can have the stem cells back there [in Beirut] within 36 hours,” explained   Dr Salem as he showed off his premises. Precious Cells rents the space from Brunel while employing about 45 people   worldwide. It is licensed to extract and bank stem cells by the Human Tissue   Authority. Dr Salem, 32, said his company was processing the stem cells of about five   patients a week from the Cells4health clinic in Lebanon. Precious Cells is   not involved in treating any of the patients and it would be illegal for any   clinic to do so in Britain. But there is nothing to stop the company   facilitating Cells4health’s practices. Dr Salem said: “We are involved in research and development in Beirut. The   current situation is a lot of treatments are not approved in the UK. They   are not clinically proven. You have to go to Beirut for treatment. There was   a centre in Germany but they shut down. “The way it works is the surgeons who are performing the procedures come from   all over the world. They are leading professionals and they fly out to do   the actual procedures. We are affiliated to them. You have good treatment   centres around the world and really rogue centres around the world.” He said, having visited Cells4health in Beirut, he was “very confident this is   the one I would recommend”. After The Sunday Telegraph’s visit, Dr Salem telephoned to   express concern. “I have been warned by others in that field not to do business with him [Dr   Kleinbloesem] because he will bring companies down,” he said. “But I believe   in stem cells and their value. They can benefit people who have no options. “I was convinced [by Dr Kleinbloesem] at the time when I went out. That was at   the end of December. I have only just now got involved and I have done my   due diligence. If we felt it isn’t right we would end our contract. It is   something I wanted to get clear.” He is not the only one Dr Kleinbloesem has been trying to convince: recently   his former clients have been emailed as he touts for business. One email was   even sent to the account of an American grandmother who subsequently died. Mary Kaye Harris, 63, from Cleveland, Ohio, suffered an infection from which   she never recovered after stem cells were injected into her brain at the   XCell-Center. In his email, Dr Kleinbloesem told patients: “Our work which has all our   spirit and was our life was ruined by false accusations.”Likening himself to Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple who left the company in   1980s only to return in triumph, Dr Kleinbloesem went on: “We are also   passionate for the adult stem cell therapy and we love this work to be able   to help many patients around the globe, who are desperate for this   breakthrough treatment.” He blamed the medical establishment for its “resistance” to stem cell   treatments for “economic reasons”, adding: “Their lobby is very strong,   making it almost impossible to provide stem cell therapy in US and Europe.   This, however, has not withheld us to look for alternatives around the   globe. Today we are proud to announce that we have established a stem cell   treatment centre in Lebanon, close to Beirut.” The email highlights a deal with “our partner laboratory in the UK in London”. Mrs Harris’s widower, Alan, 68, remains in mourning. His wife died after   contracting an infection following an operation at Dr Kleinbloesem’s then   clinic in Germany. Mrs Harris had suffered a heart attack in 2003 which left her brain starved of   oxygen. She never fully recovered and her condition had deteriorated to the   extent that in May 2010 she and her family were willing to try anything to   make her better. That included paying the XCell-Center about £20,000 for its   revolutionary stem cell treatment. Her stem cells were taken from her bone marrow and re-injected into her brain   at XCell-Center’s Dusseldorf clinic, the biggest of its type in Europe. “They kept her in the hospital for two or three days until she was well enough   to walk out,” recalled Mr Harris. “A few days later and back home, Mary Kaye   and I were sitting on the couch. She got up, took two or three steps then   had a seizure and she never recovered after that. “Cleveland doctors told us there was an infection in the brain as a result of   the surgery and that caused the seizure. She kept going downhill fast and   died on Oct 10, 2010.”In an email to The Sunday Telegraph, her son Mike added: “We thought   that the worst thing that could come from the surgery was that there would   simply be no neurological improvement. “If they would have said, 'Your Mom could get a brain infection, have multiple   seizures, loose her personality and die’... well, I think we would have not   moved forward on the surgery.” "
telegraph,28/06/2007 00:01,news,"A crucial advance in stem cell research, reported today by British scientists, will shave years off efforts to turn the cells into treatments for a vast range of ailments such as diabetes and cystic fibrosis, without the need to use human embryos.         Scientists around the world are racing to turn stem cells into nerve, muscle and many other cell types. The long-term hope is to use them to grow tissue cells to repair damaged bodies.         Now two independent teams at Cambridge and Oxford universities have discovered a type of embryonic stem cell in mice and rats which is strikingly similar to human embryonic stem cells. 'This new type provides the missing link between mouse and human embryonic stem cells,' said Prof Roger Pedersen, whose Medical Research Council-funded laboratory led the Cambridge study.         'Finding a type of mouse stem that so closely resembles the human stem cells will accelerate the delivery of health benefits from stem cell research.'         When asked how far away the first applications might be, Prof Pedersen said: 'We're talking five years. Those would be very early studies that involve a human individual. I think we can envisage larger scale clinical trials occurring within a decade.'         Sir Richard Gardner, head of the Oxford team, added: 'Having both studies reach the same conclusions at the same time allows other researchers to use this new information immediately. We are reaching a critical mass of understanding about these cells which should enable us to make the most of them in coming years.'         Both papers are published in the journal Nature today and will accelerate efforts to find embryo-free ways to make stem cells, so researchers will not have to rely exclusively on surplus human embryos from IVF clinics.         The discovery will, in the short term, help scientists obtain stem cells from disease-prone mice. The research suggests it should also be easier to take embryonic stem cells from pigs and sheep, which offer much better models of several human diseases, but have not previously yielded such cells.         Similarly, the new stem cells should make it possible to carry out genetic studies on a type of mouse that has a diabetes similar to that suffered by humans.         'Because of the close similarity of these newly discovered stem cells to human embryonic stem cells, we can now do a whole range of experiments in the mouse that are directly relevant to the human,' said Prof Pedersen.         The newly found stem cells, known as epiblast stem cells, were found in the innermost cell layer of the one week old rodent embryo.         This method contrasts with previous studies, which started with the early blastocyst stage, just four days after conception.         'These mouse cells will teach us about how human embryonic stem cells generate the hundreds of cell types that make up the human body, knowledge that will help us realise the promise of stem cell therapy,' said Elias Zerhouni, director of the US National Institutes of Health."
telegraph,16/11/2010 14:23,news,"Doctors have injected stem cells into the brain of a British stroke patient in the world's first trial of its kind. The elderly man was injected with roughly two million neural stem cells at   Southern General Hospital in Glasgow. They hope the stem cells will help the   man recover from his stroke, by transforming themselves into mature neurons   and also stimulating the brain to harness its own recuperative powers. His progress will be monitored over the next two years. The method controversially uses neural stem cells grown in the lab from those   taken from the nascent brain of a discarded 12-week-old human foetus. Stem cells are the body's master cells, that can turn themselves into   different types of mature cells given the right conditions. Laurence Dunn, a neurosurgeon, successfully injected the stem cells into the   first patient, who has since been discharged. Professor Keith Muir, a neuroscientist from Glasgow University, who is leading   the Pilot Investigation of Stem Cells in Stroke (PISCES) study, said: 'We   are pleased that the first patient in the PISCES trial has undergone surgery   successfully. 'Stroke is a common and serious condition that leaves a large number of   people with significant disability. 'In this trial we are seeking to establish the safety and feasibility of   stem cell implantation, which will require careful follow-up of the patients   who take part. 'We hope that in future it will lead on to larger studies to determine   the effects of stem cells on the disabilities that result from stroke.'He explained that some of the injected neural stem cells would automatically   transform themselves into neurons. However, earlier trials in rats showed that the stem cells also triggered 'a   variety of repair processes in the body', he said, such as helping to   grow new brain blood vessels and mobilising the brain's own population of   stem cells. It is almost 10 years since scientists at Albert Einstein College of Medicine   in New York succeeded in repairing stroke damage in rats by injecting their   brains with stem cells. Within six weeks they had become mature brain neurons, proving that it was   possible to repair the brains of another mammal. Over the next year up to 13 patients in total will be given progressively   higher doses of stem cells as part of the PISCES trial. Doses will go as   high as 20 million cells, said Prof Muir. All the participants are men over 60 who have had ischeamic strokes - caused   by a blockage of blood flow to the brain - and failed to respond   significantly to treatment. Strokes kill about 67,000 people a year in Britain, according to the Stroke   Association. Prof Muir said the stem cells in the PISCES study were grown from neural stem   cells from a 12-week-old aborted foetus from the US. The trial - carried out with the ReNeuron Group, which grew the stem cells in   the lab - received UK regulatory approval in January 2009. Anthony Hollander, professor of rheumatology and tissue engineering at Bristol   University, commented: 'This stroke trial is based on good research and   careful planning. 'It’s far too early to know if the treatment will be successful but the   very fact that the trial is now underway is a milestone for UK stem cell   research.'"
telegraph,19/10/2006 00:01,finance,"One of the world's leading stem cell companies has been picked to take part in a ground-breaking programme in the United States to find a way to get the body to start growing its own stem cells.          ReNeuron, which is based in the UK, is the only private company asked to work on the first 'Quantum Grant Programme' set up by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). The programme is intended to fund profound advances in healthcare.          The NIH is thought to have awarded $3m (£1.6m) to academics in the UK and US to find a way to get the body to start growing its own stem cells, as happens in children. ReNeuron is advising the group, The Daily Telegraph has learned.          The science needed to get adults to grow new stem cells is still thought to be years away. But, scientists believe, success could be highly significant because it could help the brain repair itself after strokes or other damage. It could also help other organs.          Despite a rocky history with the stock market, which has seen Guildford-based ReNeuron floated, taken private and then re-floated, the company is seen by many analysts as among the world's most advanced stem cell companies.          It is about to apply for a licence in the US to begin the first trial in humans using stem cells to repair brain damage after strokes. This is based on injecting stem cells it has created into the brain.          Stem cells are already used in medicine in a limited way. There are stem cells in bone marrow, which is used in transplants.          StemCells, a California-based company, is likely to beat ReNeuron to start a human stem cells trial with its treatment for the rare degenerative disorder Batten disease. But ReNeuron's medicine for stroke would affect far more people.          Stem cells have caused controversy because of the research which is done on embryonic stem cells, the most versatile kind, which are taken from foetuses.          George Bush, America's president, has ruled out using public funding for embryonic stem cell research. Despite that restriction, there is far more funding for both adult and embryonic stem cell research in the US than in the UK. ReNeuron, which uses adult stem cells, was launched with funding from the biotech entrepreneur Sir Chris Evans, who took the company private again when it was struggling in 2003.          ReNeuron's shares have slumped since relisting last year and its market capitalisation is just under £7m.          Sir Chris said: 'They are very close to the clinic for what would be the world's first major clinical trial for stem cells.' He added: 'There are very few people who are prepared to take the risk and back stem cells.'"
dailymail,30/04/2015 17:00,health,"Scientists may soon be able to predict cancer many years before it is diagnosed thanks to a breakthrough relating to DNA.The discovery relates to what are known as tiny structures called telomeres - biological caps found at the ends of chromosomes.They protect the DNA in  chromosomes from damage, much like the caps on the ends of shoelaces prevent fraying.As we get older, our telomeres get shorter and shorter, leading to DNA becoming damaged and raising the odds of age-related illnesses such as Alzheimer's, diabetes and heart disease.Shorter than average telomeres are seen as a sign of ill health and premature death.Now, scientists at Northwestern and Harvard universities say a distinct pattern in the changing length of telomeres can predict cancer many years before actual diagnosis.The crucial indicator, they say, is a rapid shortening followed by a stabilisation three or four years before cancer is diagnosed.This is the first reported 'journey' of telomere changes over the years in people developing cancer.The pattern suggests when exactly cancer hijacks the cell's ageing process - and shows that telomeres can look 15 years older in people developing the disease.And the pattern could ultimately lead to to a biomarker - and then blood test - to check for the disease, they say.They add that until now, it has been difficult to try and understand how telomeres are affected in people who develop cancer. This is because the results have been inconsistent: some studies have found they are shorter, some longer and some show no correlation at all.The new paper was published today in EBioMedicine.During the study, scientists took multiple measurements of telomeres over a 13-year period in 800 people.Of these people, 135 were eventually diagnosed with different types of cancer, including prostate, skin, lung, leukemia and others.Initially, scientists discovered telomeres aged much faster (indicated by a more rapid loss of length) in people who were developing - but not yet diagnosed with - cancer. Telomeres in those developing cancer looked as much as 15 years chronologically older than those of people who were not developing the disease.But  scientists then found the accelerated aging process stopped three to four years before the cancer diagnosis.'Understanding this pattern of telomere growth may mean it can be a predictive biomarker for cancer,' said Dr Lifang Hou, the lead study author and a professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University.'Because we saw a strong relationship in the pattern across a wide variety of cancers, with the right testing, these procedures could be used to eventually diagnose a wide variety of cancers.'The Northwestern and Harvard study is believed to be the first to look at telomere length at more than one time point before diagnosis. This is significant, say the researchers, because cancer treatment can shorten telomeres. After treatment, it's uncertain whether their length has been affected by the cancer or the treatment.'This likely explains why the previous studies have been so inconsistent,' said Dr Hou. 'We saw the inflection point at which rapid telomere shortening stabilises. We found cancer has hijacked the telomere shortening in order to flourish in the body.'Telomeres shorten every time a cell divides. The older you are, the more times each cell in your body has divided and the shorter your telomeres. Because cancer cells divide and grow rapidly, scientists would expect the cell would get so short it would self-destruct. But that's not what happens, scientists discovered. Somehow, cancer finds a way to halt that process.If scientists can identify how cancer hijacks the cell, Dr Hou said, perhaps treatments could be developed to cause cancer cells to self-destruct without harming healthy cells. "
dailymail,11/5/2015 22:10,sciencetech,"Stress can leave damaging and lasting imprints on the genes of the urban poor.This is according to a new study that claims poor people's DNA is declining in quality as a result of difficult upbringings.The results are based on the finding that people in disadvantaged environments have shorter telomeres — DNA sequences that generally shrink with age — than their advantaged peers.The study looked at the telomeres of poor and lower middle-class black, white, and Mexican residents of Detroit.Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of the strands of DNA called chromosomes, which house our genomes.In young humans, telomeres are about 8,000-10,000 nucleotides long. They shorten with each cell division and as a result of stress.Previous research has found telomere length can reliably predict life expectancy in humans.The study found that low-income residents of Detroit, no matter their race, have shorter telomeres than the national average.'There are effects of living in high-poverty, racially segregated neighbourhoods,' Dr Arline Geronimus, a visiting scholar at the Stanford Center for Advanced Study said in an interview with The Huffington Post.Within this group, how race-ethnicity and income were associated with telomere length varied dramatically.The shortest telomeres belonged to poor white people, while white Detroit residents who were lower-middle-class had the longest telomeres in the study.Black residents had about the same telomere lengths regardless of their income level while poor Mexicans had longer telomeres than Mexicans with higher incomes.Geronimus claims poor Mexicans in this study have longer telomeres than the non-poor Mexicans possibly because they grew up in less stressful environments.'They come with a set of support systems and with a cultural orientation that doesn't undermine their sense of self-worth,' she said.To explain the results of telomere length on the black population, the authors said: 'The separation between poor and non-poor black in everyday life is less marked than between poor and non-poor whites.'The research follows a similar study by Princeton University and Pennsylvania State University last year which found stressful environments can impact the DNA of children as young as nine.The study of 40 9-year-old black boys, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that those who grow up in disadvantaged environments have shorter telomeres.The researchers also reported that boys with genetic sensitivities to their environment have shorter telomeres after experiencing stressful social environments than the telomeres of boys without the genetic sensitivities.These sensitivities are based on gene variants related to the serotonin and dopamine pathways — neurotransmitters essential for relaying information between the brain and body.'I think it's very striking that these findings are in children at age nine, because you are talking about accelerated aging or stress-mediated wear and tear on your body, which make you more vulnerable to all kinds of illnesses and diseases,' said Geronimus of the previous study.'To say that you can see this by 9 years old is a very strong statement.'"
telegraph,14/03/2002 00:01,news,"THE hope that adult cells can be turned into brain, heart, muscle or any other type of cell to develop a range of revolutionary treatments receives a serious setback from research published today.Scientists and pro-life groups have pinned great hopes on the potential of adult stem cells, 'parent cells' of other types, because they offer an ethical alternative to the controversial use of stem cells from early human embryos.While stem cells from adult bone marrow, for example, are known to turn into blood cells, great excitement was generated by experiments that seem to suggest they are much more flexible, being able to turn into brain cells, liver cells and other types.Today, in the journal Nature, teams in America and Britain report that they have found a fundamental flaw in all studies that claim to show adult stem cells are really this versatile by demonstrating that they actually produce freak cells.It remains irrefutable that the cells from an early embryo can develop into any type to repair a body damaged by illness or disease, so the studies also underline the wisdom of continuing to study adult and embryonic stem cells in Britain, as recommended by a recent House of Lords report and backed by the Government.The new studies suggest that all the teams working with adult stem cells have misinterpreted the results of experiments using extremely sensitive labelling methods to determine the fate of the cells in the body.Other researchers thought that when a genetic label on a bone marrow stem cell was picked up in the brain, it meant that the marrow cell had turned into a brain cell. Now Prof Austin Smith of Edinburgh University reports evidence from studies of mice that show stem cells fuse with existing brain cells, creating cells with double the dose of chromosomes - 80 instead of the usual 40 - and unknown health consequences.In earlier work to study the fate of adult stem cells, 'researchers tend to see odd cells here and there', he said. Now he has found the reason why, revealing that cell fusion occurs, a possibility known about since the 1960s that has been overlooked in the excitement about adult cells.The hybrid cells may not be capable of dividing to create many more replacement cells, as hoped. 'They are not necessarily even multiplying. If they don't it is of no therapeutic relevance,' said Prof Smith. 'You will not repair or reconstitute anything.'If the stem cells were being used to replace genetically defective cells, the hybrids could end up with the same defect. 'You are not putting in new cells but fusing with cells that are already there, so the stem cell you have introduced takes on the character of the resident cell.' The work is not necessarily the 'kiss of death' for research in the field but will require a major re-evaluation of all earlier work, said Prof Smith.'If nothing else, our study indicates that calls for a halt to embryonic stem cell research are not scientifically justified and confirms the far-sightedness of the UK legislature in approving embryonic stem cell derivation and research.'Similar experiments to show how fusion occurs between bone marrow cells and other types are reported in Nature by Dr Naohiro Terada of the University of Florida.Both teams only tested whether this could occur in a petri dish. Animal studies will be required to confirm that spontaneous cell fusion occurs in the body and that it provides an alternative explanation for recent demonstrations of adult stem cell plasticity.If confirmed by animal studies, the findings could be a reality check for those hoping to use adult stem cells clinically. Fused cells carry double the normal amount of DNA, and may be unhealthy. 'It might be a precautionary tale for stem cell research,' said Dr Terada.'This is critical,' said Dr Robin Lovell-Badge of the National Institute for Medical Research, London. 'If you are putting cells in abnormal situations, asking an adult stem cell to do something it would not usually do, we should not be surprised if it does something unusual. This has to be taken very seriously.'"
telegraph,27/06/2000 00:00,news,"TO read the genome you need GM bacteria containing chunks of human genetic code, computers and robots. Then you have to spend years smashing the genome to pieces and figuring out how to put it back together again.                                Click to enlarge (Very large graphic)          Scientists would like to read - sequence - the 3.12 billion letters of the code directly, using a scanning tunnelling microscope to take pictures of DNA. But this method has yet to be perfected and current methods, which rely on clever chemistry, are limited to reading 500-letter pieces.In other words, the problem of how to read the genome boils down to how to break it into tiny pieces, how to manipulate them, and then how to put them together again in the right order.Much has been made of how the race to the working draft has seen a clash of technologies, one used by Dr Craig Venter of Celera Genomics, and the other by Dr John Sulston of the Sanger Centre, Cambridge, one of the 16 collaborating centres in the publicly-funded Human Genome Project.But in reality, they are taking a similar approach: the only real difference is that Dr Venter is able to skip one step because he can exploit the data generated by the publicly-funded project, which is posted on the internet.Both teams manipulate pieces of human DNA by growing it in bacteria. Large pieces are put in artificial chromosomes, and small pieces in little rings of DNA called plasmids. Either way, bacteria are grown in a petri dish so that many clones - copies - of the human DNA are made for later study.To break the genome into pieces to create libraries of bacteria, both teams also use the so-called shotgun approach, a technique first developed by the double Nobel Laureate Fred Sanger, to read the 5,375 letters of the genetic code of a simple virus in 1977.In the process, many copies of the genome are broken up randomly into pieces that are small enough to read. Then the pieces are compared, overlaps are found, and the entire code reassembled again.Because the process is random, it becomes progressively harder to fill in the gaps. That is why the milestone selected as representing the draft - 85 per cent of the genome - is not entirely arbitrary: it represents when scientists will turn to more sophisticated methods to close the gaps. The key difference between the public and private effort rests on whether a one-step or two-step shotgun process is used.The human genetic code is so huge that the public consortium introduced an intermediate step, when a rough 'map' of the genome is made (see graphic). Several copies of the three billion-letter genome are randomly cut into pieces between 40,000 and 200,000 letters long.Each is put into a BAC, a bacterial artificial chromosome, that can be inserted into a bacterium to make more copies. Landmarks on these big pieces are identified, so overlapping pieces can be identified and the genome put back together. The result is called a map. Dr Sulston said: 'You reconstruct the genome as a jigsaw puzzle, at the level of 200,000 bases.'This map is used to locate the smaller pieces that are sequenced from both ends. Each large piece in the map is further broken down into smaller pieces, around 2,000 letters long, each of which is copied by plugging them into plasmids, bits of DNA that can replicate in bacteria.These pieces can then be sequenced from both ends and, using the map, reassembled into the genome. Celera, in contrast, shortened the process with a 'whole genome shotgun' approach: Dr Venter devised a way to blow the genome into many bits, between 2,000 and 10,000 letters, and sequence them without regard to their position. The challenge was whether, like all the king's horses and all the king's men, he could put the parts together again.For that, he relied on a supercomputer and clever computer programs to compare 500 million trillion letters of code sequenced since last September. However, what is not often appreciated - and was admitted yesterday in Celera's announcement - is that he relies on the map produced by his rivals. 'We are here to help everybody,' said Dr Sulston, who is denied access to Celera's data.A Celera spokesman said: 'The combination of these two complementary genome sequencing and assembly approaches has greatly reduced the time necessary for Celera to finish the sequence and assembly of the human genome.'To read the small pieces of human DNA carried in the bacteria, both teams use a code-reading method first devised by Dr Sanger though, as he remarked: 'There is a lot of robotics now - we had to measure out things with pipettes and test-tubes.'"
telegraph,4/6/2011 21:00,news,"Wealthy Britons can now pay to freeze and store their stem cells as an 'insurance policy' that could be used to treat diseases they develop in the future or even grow new organs.A service that extracts stem cells from adult blood and stores it has been   given approval for the first time by the regulatory body the Human Tissue   Authority.Until now it has only been possible to store stem cells for babies that have   taken from umbilical cord and many parents have taken advantage of this to   provide their children with the potential for stem cell treatments in the   future. The new service, called Oristem, claims adults can now take   advantage of the same potential advances in stem cell treatments. It is likely to attract people who have a family history of hereditary medical   conditions as well as members of the so called 'worried well' who   want to ensure they have the option to use such treatments should they need   them in the future.The companies behind the project, which charges £2,495 to collect and store   the stem cells in cryogenic freezers for 20 years, have begun taking the   blood samples from their first clients after being given a regulatory   licence to store the cells.Athol Haas, chief executive of Pharmacell, one of the three companies behind   the service, said: 'Most of the clients who have made pre-orders ahead   of the licence being approved are either expecting to suffer from a   hereditary degenerative disease or they understand that having this form of   biological insurance is a good thing.'The service uses cells known as blastocyst-like stem cells that are found   circulating in human blood. These are unspecialised cells that can develop   into many different types of tissue in the body.Currently no stem cell therapy exists that can use these types of cells for   treating diseases. The companies behind the Oristem, however, believe that   as researchers develop new techniques and new technology, it will be   possible to use these stem cells for treating diseases including stroke,   multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.Researchers also hope that it will be possible at some point to use stored   stem cells to grow new organs for patients. Last year doctors were able to   build a new windpipe for a Colombian woman using her own stem cells before   transplanting it into her.There are also hopes that stem cells could provide treatments for major causes   of blindness such as macular degeneration and provide ways of repairing   damaged heart tissue and blood vessels.Mr Haas said: 'Although there is no specific therapy exists that uses   these stem cells yet, we expect that to change in the next couple of years   and are actively working towards that.'These cells are pre-differentiated and so have the potential to become   many different cell types in the body. So far we have developed 90 different   cell types from these stem cells.'Clients hoping to take advantage of the new stem cell bank will have to give   around three fluid ounces of blood which is then treated to extract around   10 billion stem cells. These are then stored in small vials that are frozen   at -112 degrees F for at least 80 years.Graeme Purdy, chief executive of Ilika, the company that oversees the   extraction of the stem cells, said: 'We are guaranteeing that we can   store the cells for at least 20 years and they will remain viable. We are   not sure if they will still be viable beyond that, but if they are then we   will store them for longer.'"
telegraph,15/11/2006 00:01,news,"                                             Video: The canine cured                                             A stem-cell treatment for the degenerative and fatal disease muscular dystrophy, which mostly affects boys and young men, could be available for testing on patients within two years, following a remarkable series of experiments reported today.                                        Muscular dystrophy comes in at least 20 forms — with Duchenne being the most common — and causes muscle wasting, progressive paralysis and eventually death, affecting about 30,000 people in Britain alone.          There are no effective treatments but today an Italian team reports success in experiments on dogs that have a form of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is caused by a lack of the protein dystrophin in muscle fibres.          Golden retrievers also suffer from the genetic disease, the result of a naturally occurring mutation and have been specially bred because they are the most accurate animal model of the human disease.          The dramatic results of stem-cell therapy on the animals are reported in the journal Nature by Prof Giulio Cossu, the director of the Stem Cell Research Institute of San Raffaele Scientific Institute of Milan. The work shows that it is possible to halt this devastating disease and possibly even reverse it to a degree.          The therapy was described as 'a very significant advance, perhaps even a breakthrough' by Prof George Dickson of Royal Holloway, University of London.          Dr Marita Pohlschmidt, the director of research at the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, said: 'If it does prove to be successful in humans, this technology has the potential to develop into an efficient and ground breaking treatment.'          Working with the University of Pavia and the Veterinarian School of Macon Alfort in Paris, Prof Cossu's team transplanted cells called mesoangioblasts — stem cells gathered from small blood vessels in muscle — that are programmed to develop into muscle cells.          The cells came from healthy dogs and were multiplied in the laboratory to sufficient quantities. These were injected into the blood stream of dogs with the disease and their immune systems were suppressed to stop the stem cells from being rejected.          'That worked,' Prof Cossu told The Daily Telegraph. The cells were carried around the body to the affected muscles and increased their strength, which in turn improved the ability of the dogs to walk.          One retriever, Azor, was only five months old but was already limping as a result of the disease. But, after five consecutive injections of stem cells extracted from adult muscle, he was able to bound around like his peers.          'Azor regained incredible mobility, much more than when the treatment started,' said Prof Cossu.          'He could not extend his hind limbs at first and was jumping like a rabbit. But it was amazing to see how he could then move, without any fatigue. In dogs, this is the best result so far.'          To see if it was also possible to correct the dogs' own cells, so they would not need anti-rejection drugs, stem cells were isolated from affected dogs and a type of virus — a lentivirus — used to insert into the cells a corrected copy of the faulty dystrophin protein, actually a stripped down version of the human gene.          Other animals — around four months and already limping — were injected five times at monthly intervals with their own modified stem cells but there was no improvement, even though the gene therapy seemed to work at the molecular level.          In the long-term, this type of transplant would be preferable because it would do away with a lifetime of immune suppression: without this, some dogs in the trial that received stem cells from another animal rapidly lost the ability to walk.          Prof Cossu has already discussed human transplants with an Italian charity and is planning clinical trials. The first attempt is likely to use stem cells from a donor with a similar tissue type, the method that succeeded with the dogs.          The professor estimated that another year or two will be necessary to get a patient's own genetically modified stem cells to work. 'Even though by itself it may not lead to a complete cure, it would ameliorate the condition, then step by step we could work on this to the point of getting a real cure.'          Prof Kay Davies, of Oxford University, commented: 'The use of stem cells to treat human disease holds great promise but the actual delivery of such therapy is thought to be many years away.          'The data presented in the paper from Cossu's group, using a particular type of stem cell, a mesoangioblast stem cell, changes that view. . . this is a major step forward and suggests that this approach may be effective for use in DMD patients.'          Dr Peter Wigmore, of Nottingham University, said: 'The importance of this result is not only in providing a potential cure for a currently incurable condition but also in the use of relatively easy to isolate adult stem cells.          'The use of these cells avoids the controversial use of embryonic or foetal stem cells. In addition, the relatively easy delivery of these cells via the blood stream makes this a viable method to treat humans.'          Prof Dominic Wells, of Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, said: 'The substantial clinical improvement in a natural mutant dog version of DMD will encourage development of human clinical trials of this form of therapy for a range of muscle diseases.

telegraph,23/05/2008 00:01,news,"            A new scientific study has uncovered the secret of eternal youth. Roger Highfield reports.                                                               Dolly creator Prof Ian Wilmut shuns cloning                                                                        Embryo research: a source of hope or horror?                                                                        Links between humans' ancestors redrawn                                             The secret of eternal youth, at least at the cellular level, has been uncovered by scientists.         The work is of fundamental importance for understanding the self renewing properties of embryonic stem cells, 'parent cells' in the early embryo that have the potential to turn into more than 200 specialised cell types, which are being studied by many groups worldwide as the basis of new treatments for a vast range of conditions, from Parkinson's Disease to stroke.         Studies are now under way to back the hope that the fundamental discovery will help to grow them in the laboratory and to improve an embryo free method of making stem cells, developed in Japan, to make sure that adult cells, for instance skin cells, can be turned into an embyronic form so patients can be treated with their own cells.         The new work focuses on a special property of stem cells from the early embryo: they grow indefinitely in the laboratory, so that one embryo could in theory provide cells to treat generations of patients.          Only when various proteins and other factors are added do they turn into one particular type, whether nerve or heart cells.         Now Prof Austin Smith's team at Cambridge University reports in the journal Nature that blocking the activation of a molecule called ERK, by another given the name FGF4, is the secret of how embryonic stem cells stay youthful so they do not turn into other types, overturning current understanding and shedding light on the origins of some kinds of cancer.         In the three decades since these stem cells were first described, various combinations of feeder cells, growth factors, hormones and serums have been used to maintain them in their embryonic state in the lab, suggesting that embryonic stem cells required signals from their environment to keep them youthful.          But the opposite is the case: these conditions inhibit certain signalling molecules that make the stem cells mature to form other types, such as bone, brain and liver.          'Our study suggests that what we believe about how embryonic stem cell self-renewal is controlled is wrong,' says Dr Qi-Long Ying of the University of Southern California, USC, lead author.          'Our findings will likely change the research direction of many stem cell laboratories.'         In other words, Dr Ying, working with Prof Smith, Jason Wray and colleagues at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research show that by inhibiting molecular factors that turn stem cells turn into other kinds, notably two called ERK1 and ERK2, a process called differentiation, they can be kept in a permanent embryonic state.         With better understanding of the multiplication process of embryonic stem cells, researchers also have a new insight into tumour cell growth as these cells share similar qualities.          'Our study reveals part of the little known process of how embryonic stem cells multiplication is regulated. This is important for us in understanding how to control tumour cell growth moving forward in cancer research,' says Ying.         The team believes the discovery is of fundamental importance to understanding the special properties of embryonic stem cells, and will aid the development of methods to grow them in the laboratory, and from a range of species.         'This study presents a completely new paradigm for understanding how to grow embryonic stem cells in the laboratory,' comments Dr Martin Pera, director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Centre for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC.          'The discovery has major implications for large scale production of specialized cells, such as brain, heart muscle and insulin producing cells, for future therapeutic use.'"
telegraph,20/11/2012 08:47,news,"A simple blood test could help predict how long you are going to live, new research suggests.Researchers have successfully measured the speed of ageing in wild birds,   opening up the possibility of doing the same for humans.The test allows you to look at the 'biological age' of individuals and also   accurately predict, major illness aside, their lifespan.The test measures the average length of tiny structures called telomeres,   which are known to get shorter each time a cell divides during an organism's   lifetime.The length of telomeres provide a more accurate estimate of a person's true   biological age rather than their actual chronological age.This has led some experts to suggest that telomere tests could be used to   estimate how long they have left to live, assuming they die of natural   causes.At least one company is offering a £400 blood test in the UK for people   interested in seeing how fast they are ageing based on their average   telomere length.Telomere tests have been widely used on animals in experiments, now scientists   have performed them on an isolated population of songbirds in the   Seychelles, the Independent has reported.'We saw that telomere length is a better indicator of life expectancy than   chronological age,' said David Richardson, of the University of East Anglia.'So by measuring telomere length we have a way of estimating the biological   age of an individual - how much of its life it has used up,'The researchers tested the average telomere lengths of a population of 320   Seychelles warblers on Cousin Island, which ornithologists have studied for   20 years.'Our results provide the first clear and unambiguous evidence of a   relationship between telomere length and mortality in the wild, and   substantiate the prediction that telomere length and shortening rate can act   as an indicator of biological age further to chronological age,' says the   study, published in the journal Molecular Ecology.Dr Richardson said: 'We investigated whether, at any given age, their telomere   lengths could predict imminent death.'We found that short and rapidly shortening telomeres were a good indication   that the bird would die within a year.'We also found that individuals with longer telomeres had longer lifespans   overall.'However while telomeres do shorten with chronological age, the rate at which   this happens differs between individuals of the same age.'This is because individuals experience different amounts of biological stress   due to the challenges and exertions they face in life. Telomere length can   be used as a measure of the amount of damage an individual has accumulated   over its life.'Telomeres are often said to be to chromosomes what plastic tips are to   shoelaces.As we age they get shorter and more ragged and lead to damage to the   chromosome and DNA."
telegraph,16/11/2006 00:01,news,"A stem-cell treatment for the degenerative and fatal disease muscular dystrophy, which mostly affects boys and young men, could be available for testing on patients within two years, following a remarkable series of experiments reported today.          Muscular dystrophy comes in at least 20 forms — with Duchenne being the most common — and causes muscle wasting, progressive paralysis and eventually death, affecting about 30,000 people in Britain alone.          There are no effective treatments but today an Italian team reports success in experiments on dogs that have a form of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is caused by a lack of the protein dystrophin in muscle fibres.          Golden retrievers also suffer from the genetic disease, the result of a naturally occurring mutation and have been specially bred because they are the most accurate animal model of the human disease.          The dramatic results of stem-cell therapy on the animals are reported in the journal Nature by Prof Giulio Cossu, the director of the Stem Cell Research Institute of San Raffaele Scientific Institute of Milan. The work shows that it is possible to halt this devastating disease and possibly even reverse it to a degree.          The therapy was described as 'a very significant advance, perhaps even a breakthrough' by Prof George Dickson of Royal Holloway, University of London.          Dr Marita Pohlschmidt, the director of research at the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, said: 'If it does prove to be successful in humans, this technology has the potential to develop into an efficient and ground breaking treatment.'          Working with the University of Pavia and the Veterinarian School of Macon Alfort in Paris, Prof Cossu's team transplanted cells called mesoangioblasts — stem cells gathered from small blood vessels in muscle — that are programmed to develop into muscle cells.          The cells came from healthy dogs and were multiplied in the laboratory to sufficient quantities. These were injected into the blood stream of dogs with the disease and their immune systems were suppressed to stop the stem cells from being rejected.          'That worked,' Prof Cossu told The Daily Telegraph. The cells were carried around the body to the affected muscles and increased their strength, which in turn improved the ability of the dogs to walk.          One retriever, Azor, was only five months old but was already limping as a result of the disease. But, after five consecutive injections of stem cells extracted from adult muscle, he was able to bound around like his peers.          'Azor regained incredible mobility, much more than when the treatment started,' said Prof Cossu.          'He could not extend his hind limbs at first and was jumping like a rabbit. But it was amazing to see how he could then move, without any fatigue. In dogs, this is the best result so far.'          To see if it was also possible to correct the dogs' own cells, so they would not need anti-rejection drugs, stem cells were isolated from affected dogs and a type of virus — a lentivirus — used to insert into the cells a corrected copy of the faulty dystrophin protein, actually a stripped down version of the human gene.          Other animals — around four months and already limping — were injected five times at monthly intervals with their own modified stem cells but there was no improvement, even though the gene therapy seemed to work at the molecular level.          In the long-term, this type of transplant would be preferable because it would do away with a lifetime of immune suppression: without this, some dogs in the trial that received stem cells from another animal rapidly lost the ability to walk.          Prof Cossu has already discussed human transplants with an Italian charity and is planning clinical trials. The first attempt is likely to use stem cells from a donor with a similar tissue type, the method that succeeded with the dogs.          The professor estimated that another year or two will be necessary to get a patient's own genetically modified stem cells to work. 'Even though by itself it may not lead to a complete cure, it would ameliorate the condition, then step by step we could work on this to the point of getting a real cure.'          Prof Kay Davies, of Oxford University, commented: 'The use of stem cells to treat human disease holds great promise but the actual delivery of such therapy is thought to be many years away.          'The data presented in the paper from Cossu's group, using a particular type of stem cell, a mesoangioblast stem cell, changes that view. . . this is a major step forward and suggests that this approach may be effective for use in DMD patients.'          Dr Peter Wigmore, of Nottingham University, said: 'The importance of this result is not only in providing a potential cure for a currently incurable condition but also in the use of relatively easy to isolate adult stem cells.          'The use of these cells avoids the controversial use of embryonic or foetal stem cells. In addition, the relatively easy delivery of these cells via the blood stream makes this a viable method to treat humans.'

telegraph,20/05/2005 00:01,news,"At the heart of the latest cloning advances is the method originally used in 1996 to produce Dolly the sheep by Prof Ian Wilmut and his Roslin Institute team.          But producing human clones is much more difficult than cloning animals, as acknowledged by Dr Miodrag Stojkovic, the scientist at Newcastle's Centre for Life who created Britain's first cloned human embryos.          With Prof Alison Murdoch, he had hoped to use spare eggs from IVF treatment. But they succeeded only with fresh eggs - from the procedure of 'follicle reduction', when a woman on hormone treatment produces many more eggs than are required for fertility treatment.          The Newcastle team managed to create only one blastocyst, an embryo advanced enough to isolate stem cells, and failed to derive a line of embryonic stem cells.          The South Korean team led by Prof Woo Suk Hwang went much further and created 31 embryos and successfully derived 11 lines of stem cells.          Success depended on many elements, including the fact that human 'feeder' cells - not animal cells - were used to grow the embryonic cells and that the eggs were high-quality, fresh and from young donors.          It even appears relevant that the Koreans, experienced at handling chopsticks, were more adept at micromanipulation of eggs and embryos. They avoided the use of antibodies and chemicals to obtain cells from the embryos and the donor DNA was retrieved with a light touch.          The embryonic stem cells they created are chromosomally normal, self-renewing and 'pluripotent' - meaning they have the ability to form the three major types of cells in the early embryo that give rise to all other cells.          For example, the stem cells can turn into cells that display characteristics of skin and retina cells, muscle cell bundles, bone matrix cells and the gastro-intestinal and respiratory lining.          Dr Anne McLaren of Cambridge University, said: 'I am very excited by the possibility of having large amounts of material, for instance from juvenile diabetes patients, to do research on the complex genetic and non-genetic causes.          'From a very small number of eggs you can make enough stem cell lines from each serious disease to do a huge amount of valuable research.'          Using stem cells for treatments is a more distant prospect. Among the Korean patients, embryonic stem cells were produced from a woman spinal cord patient.          Before they can be used for repair, researchers must find ways - without the help of animal products - efficiently to turn embryonic stem cells into the right type, stably and in sufficient numbers. The Koreans also need to carry out safety tests in animals.          There is a theoretical risk that, if even a single embryonic stem cell is among the nerve cells used for transplant into a patient, it could turn into the wrong type of tissue or multiply to form a cancer consisting of a wide range of cell types.          The stem cell lines produced from patients with hereditary diseases are likely to display characteristics of the disease, so probably they will not be appropriate for direct use in treating the patients.          But there are ways round this, including genetic modification and the use of embryonic stem cells from a normal patient with a good tissue match.          While many scientists were excited by yesterday's developments, pro-life groups attacked the work. Comment on Reproductive Ethics said: 'The moral issues remain unaltered; to destroy human life in order to attempt to cure others is an inadmissible trade-off.'          Life, the leading pro-life charity, said: 'These figures, if they are true, only make the exploitation of some women more likely. Cloning involves exposing women to dangerous fertility drugs in order to collect sufficient eggs to use in the cloning process.'          Despite the apparently noble motives of the team, the work would lead to cloning babies, Life said.          'We can assume that they can reliably produce embryos healthy enough to try implanting them in women. This Frankenstein science should be banned.'          Prof Julian Savulescu, an Oxford University ethicist, said: 'By holding back research, we may be responsible for the deaths of many people while we delay developing treatments.          'It is irresponsible and immoral not to do more to push ahead this life-saving research.'                   What they said          'This report brings science a giant step forward towards the day when some of human-kind's most devastating diseases and injuries can be effectively treated through the use of therapeutic stem cells.'           Professor Woo Suk Hwang, Seoul National University          'This kind of research cloning will inevitably lead to reproductive cloning. This alone is sufficient reason to justify an immediate prohibition on work in this field.'          The pro-life group, Comment on Reproductive Ethics           'This research is stunning news for humanity. One day it may be possible for a patient with leukaemia to donate a skin cell for that to be cloned to derive blood stem cells for transplant back into that patient without the need for immunisuppressive drugs. Such treatment could be used to repair organs and tissues with no current capacity to regenerate, such as the heart and brain, after a heart attack and stroke. It is now thoroughly irresponsible and immoral not to do more to push ahead this life saving research.'          Prof Julian Savulescu, Oxford University Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics           'These scientists may be acting out of the noblest of motives, but every week news breaks of astonishing progress in the treatment of debilitating diseases using adult stem cells. Adult stem cell research, not cloning, represents the ethical and scientific way forward.'          Life, pro-life charity"
telegraph,28/02/2002 00:01,news,"EXPERIMENTS on cloned and surplus human embryos were approved yesterday by a House of Lords committee which ruled that there were not enough ethical objections to outweigh the potential benefits to science and medicine.Claims by pro-life and religious groups that scientific advances in research using stem cells grown from adults have made embryo experiments unnecessary were rejected by the committee.It also backed research on reprogramming human eggs with donor DNA to treat certain genetic diseases. This could one day lead to the birth of babies with three genetic parents.The report by the Lords select committee on stem cell research was requested by the Government following the passing of laws that allowed research on cloned embryos up to the age of 14 days but banned human cloning.It concluded that because of the potential of stem cells to make any tissue for repairing the human body, research on human embryonic stem cells should be allowed under strict regulation and with actual cloning kept to a minimum.The committee also called for the Government to carry out a further review of the science towards the end of the decade, to weigh up whether research on human embryos was still necessary, and to help secure an international ban on cloning babies.Although British scientists can already apply to conduct research on stem cells - the body's master cells that have the potential to develop into around 200 cell types in the body - the report is significant because it rejects the key scientific argument made against such work by pro-life groups.Stem cells can be obtained from surplus human embryos from IVF, or from cloned embryos, but there has been mounting evidence that stem cells from adults can also be turned into a range of cell types, so that bone marrow cells can be turned into brain cells, for example.The Rt Rev Richard Harries, the Bishop of Oxford and chairman of the committee, said the pro-life claim that adult stem cells could be used instead of embryonic cells was 'the major issue' it discussed.'We were satisfied on the basis of the scientific evidence that as yet research on adult stem cells has not, as some claim, made research on embryonic stem cells unnecessary. 'We have concluded that the regulations passed by both Houses of Parliament by large majorities just over a year ago should stand.'The embryonic cells in question are the 25 or so cells in a 100-cell five-day-old embryo, called a blastocyst, and will provide a crucial benchmark for studies of adult stem cells. Even scientists who study adult stem cells argue that 'both avenues of research must be kept open'.'This issue touches people at their deepest convictions,' said Bishop Harries. 'If you are a person like Christopher Reeve [the paralysed Superman actor] your deepest conviction is to find therapy. If you stand within a particular religious tradition you have a particular view about the moral status of the embryo.'Eventually, stem cells could offer 'real hope' to sufferers of debilitating diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, he said. 'For this to be fully realised, no avenue of research should be blocked at this stage.'Where there was a need for research on early human embryos, 'surplus' embryos left over after IVF treatment donated specifically for research should be used in preference to specially-created embryos wherever possible, the committee said.It stressed that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority should not allow embryos to be cloned for stem cell research using a process called cell nuclear replacement (CNR) unless there is a 'demonstrable and exceptional need.'The method, which would involve using stem cells from cloned embryos, makes it possible to grow a patient's own tissue.The committee said it did not accept that allowing CNR - sometimes called therapeutic cloning, a term it dislikes - for research will constitute a 'slippery slope' to reproductive cloning, which has now been specifically prohibited by the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001.Yesterday, the Pro Life Alliance said it would lodge a petition in the House of Lords against last month's Court of Appeal judgment, which cleared the way for the use of cloned embryos and refused permission to go to the Lords.The Lords report also approves a technique which allows women with defective mitochondria, the power packs of cells, in their eggs to have it replaced by oocyte nuclear transfer. Alterations in mitochondrial DNA lead to rare but severe diseases."
telegraph,1/5/2011 21:00,news,"Why are some parents paying to have their babies’ stem cells deep-frozen? Anna Tobin reports. When Paula Aspinall, 35, gave birth to her second child, she and her husband,   Peter, arranged to have blood from baby Daniel’s umbilical cord collected   and frozen for storage. This procedure, done privately, cost £2,000. But the   couple, from Northwich in Cheshire, saw it as an investment in the health of   their growing family: cord blood is rich in potentially lifesaving stem   cells, the building blocks of all other cells in the body. Cord-blood transplants are used in the treatment of life-threatening blood   disorders such as leukaemia, and many scientists think they could in the   future help treat chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes, and   even be used to regenerate damaged body parts.  “When I was pregnant, a close friend who was diagnosed with cancer underwent   successful treatment that involved using his own stem cells, taken from the   bone marrow,” says Mrs Aspinall.“We then heard that we could store our baby’s cord blood, which might save his   life one day. And it’s not only Daniel who could benefit – his stem cells   could be used to treat his five-year-old sister Megan and other   family members.”In the NHS, personal cord-blood banking is offered only in rare circumstances,   such as when a genetic disorder runs in the family and stem cells (which   should match the individual’s own genetic make-up as closely as possible)   may be needed for a future transplant to replace diseased or damaged cells.  So should more parents consider paying to harvest their baby’s cord blood?   Certainly, some are already doing so: according to the Human Tissue   Authority, 2,300 cord bloods were privately banked in 2009/10.  The procedure, now offered in the UK by private companies (who must be   licensed by the Human Tissue Authority), is quick and painless.Once the placenta is delivered, a trained health professional inserts a needle   into the umbilical vein and drains the blood into a special bag. This is   then cooled to sub-zero temperatures and stored, usually for up to 25 years.Yet despite the potential of cord blood to treat diseases, many doctors and   scientists in the UK are reluctant to recommend private banking. The Royal   College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists accepts that parents should have   the choice, but says it “remains unconvinced about the benefits” for most   families.One reason for their reluctance to treat people with their own stem cells is   because a genetic condition could be lying dormant in the foetus, as happens   with leukaemia. “Childhood leukaemia is mercifully very rare, and the use of a stem cell   transplant to cure it even more so,” says Kenneth Campbell, clinical   information specialist at the charity Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research. “Even   if a cord-blood transplant is needed, we would advise against transplanting   the child’s own cord stem cells as there is a possibility that   'pre-leukaemic’ stem cells are present in the cord blood, so you could be   giving the child back cells that could trigger the leukaemia again.”In addition, many NHS hospitals discourage private banking because of staff   issues, with midwives reluctant to undertake the extra work and   responsibility.But what about future use of stem cells in the treatment of non-genetic   conditions, in particular in repairing cell damage? Last year,   three-year-old cerebral palsy sufferer Sasha Browne became the first British   child to be infused with her own cord blood stem cells. Early signs show   some improvements in her motor skills and visual and cognitive abilities.   But doctors point out that this research is still in its infancy, and there   is no clinical proof yet that regenerative stem cell therapy works. In   Sasha’s case, a placebo effect hasn’t been ruled out, and other treatment   she received, such as physiotherapy, could have also had some effect. Also, stem cells collected from the umbilical cord are not ideal for   regenerative therapy. Embryonic stem cells are the true “primitive” stem   cells and can develop into any cell in the human body. Cord blood stem cells   are already programmed to be blood cells, so to turn them into any other   cell scientists have to learn to re-programme them. This process could take   decades to perfect.Most UK specialists would prefer new parents to donate cord blood to the NHS   public cord blood bank, so that stem cells can be provided for anyone who   should need them. At present, only a few hospitals offer this facility but   Dr Antonio Pagliuca, Divisional and Transplant Director at the Department of   Haematological Medicine, King’s College Hospital, London, says the goal is   to expand the bank to 50,000 cord bloods, with the aim of covering all   genetic types. “If we can do this, we believe we will be able to find a match for the   majority of people requiring a stem cell transplant,” he says.Paula Aspinall, however, has no regrets. “Science is developing so rapidly, we   don’t know what treatments could be available in a few years,” she argues.   “We hope the cells never have to be used, but they are there if needed.” For more information about cord blood banking, visit www.rcog.org.uk"
telegraph,9/10/2007 18:00,news,"            Sir Martin Evans, the British scientist who launched the stem cell revolution, talked to Roger Highfield about his Nobel prize                                                               Britons share in Nobel Prize for medicine                                             Sir Martin Evans, 66, is the father of research on stem cells, which can turn into any of the 200 or so types in the body and show great promise in new treatments for heart disease, Parkinson's and more besides.         Yesterday morning, while sitting in his car in a layby outside Cambridge, he learned that he had shared the Nobel prize for medicine for the applications of his stem cell work in genetic alteration of rodents to replicate human disease which has also revolutionised worldwide efforts to work out what genes do in the body.          The news was 'astonishing,' he said, after celebrating the news with his wife Judith and his son Christopher with a lunch of champagne and sandwiches. 'It is a boyhood dream come true.'         He rang his son Simon, who is working near Moscow, and his daughter, Clare, with the news. 'She is about to give birth and I am trying to clear up her house beforehand, which is why I am in Cambridge.'          This is the first British science Nobel since 2003 With British born Oliver Smithies and American Mario Capecchi, who showed how to genetically alter stem cells, he shares the 10 million Swedish crown (£750,000) prize for the ground-breaking discoveries that 'led to the creation of an immensely powerful technology,' the Nobel committee said.          'Some of it will go on a new house,' said Sir Martin, the former Director of the School of Biosciences and Professor of Mammalian Genetics of Cardiff University.          With the support of the Medical Research Council in Cambridge University he developed ways to grow stem cells from the mouse embryo two decades ago. When an embryo is a few days old – and ready to implant in the womb - it is hollow and Sir Martin found a way to grow and multiply cells from the part of the embryo that will turn into the foetus and most of the placenta.          This research that would, among other things, inspire the effort to create Dolly the cloned sheep and efforts to grow human embryonic stem cells, now being studied for spinal repair, treatments for heart attacks and more besides.         But these embryonic stem cells can also grow indefinitely in the lab, providing huge opportunities to genetically alter them, the subject of his Nobel.          Mix these stem cells with the cells of another early embryo and the resulting offspring is a blend called a chimera (in Greek mythology, the chimera was a monster that had the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of a dragon) that can produce eggs and sperm that are the offspring of the GM stem cells.          This approach has been the basis of an extraordinary range of experiments on mice to study the role and function of genes. Commonly known as 'knockout mice', they have targeted genes which are inactivated, or silenced. The rodents are now the universal test-bed, from basic research into human diseases to the development of new treatments.          Such gene 'knockout' experiments have elucidated the roles of numerous genes in embryo development, adult physiology, ageing and disease. To date, more than ten thousand mouse genes - about half - have been knocked out. Ongoing international efforts will make 'knockout' mice for all genes available within the near future.          With gene targeting it is now possible to produce almost any type of DNA modification, allowing scientists to establish the roles of individual genes in disease. Gene targeting has already produced more than five hundred different mouse models of human disorders, including cardiovascular and neuro-degenerative diseases, diabetes and cancer.          Sir Martin said that he supported research on human embryonic stem cells but said that, given research to 'reprogram' cells in Japan, he believed that it would soon be possible to turn adult cells directly into embryonic like cells without the controversial step of making an embryo. 'The writing is on the wall,' he said.          Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London, who worked in Sir Martin's lab when stem cells were discovered, said of the prize: 'This is excellent news. It is long overdue.'          The scientist who led the team that cloned Dolly the sheep, Prof Ian Wilmut of Edinburgh University, commented: 'This group opened up one of the most productive areas of biomedical research. So far most of the research has been in the mouse, but in future research with human embryo stem cells will focus directly on human development and inherited diseases.'          He was even congratulated by the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who said: 'I want to congratulate Professor Sir Martin Evans on this marvellous achievement. This is a proud day for Sir Martin, for Cardiff University and for the country. It is my hope that our budding young scientists will follow the lead of Sir Martin Evans and that the UK can produce many more Nobel Prize winners.'"
telegraph,19/06/2007 00:01,news,"            The deeper scientists look into the human genetic code, the more baffling it becomes but it is also increasing their understanding of disease, reports Roger Highfield                                                               Video: Ewan Birney explains the science behind the search                                             Seven years ago, with much ballyhoo, scientists unveiled the book of life - the DNA required to build and run a human being.          Last week, a small army of geneticists reported the results of the first systematic attempt to make sense of this book.          What they found makes uncomfortable reading for those who thought they understood the basics of biology, but it does provide tantalising hints of new ways to fight disease.          This, the most detailed study of DNA, is a landmark in genetics research, for the more scientists understand the details of how our bodies work, the easier it will be to fix them when they go wrong.          But the latest findings turn basic biology concepts upside-down, could rewrite conventional wisdom when it comes to common ailments, and contain many puzzles, including one that may even challenge our understanding of the way evolution works.          The basics of genetics go like this: DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a long chemical that is coiled up in sausage-like bundles, called chromosomes.          Two metres of DNA are crammed this way into the chromosomes within a single cell.          DNA is a ladder-like molecule twisted into a double helix, where the rungs consist of chemical units, called nucleotides.          These units are drawn from an alphabet of life that consists of only four letters - A, T, C and G (see graphic) - so the code reads GGGAAACCC and so on for around three billion letters, the entire complement, or genome, of one set of chromosomes.          This one-dimensional script, which was first revealed in 2000, 'somehow carries within it all of the instructions necessary to take a single-cell embryo and turn it into a very complex biological entity called a human being,' said Francis Collins, whose US National Human Genome Research Institute provided much of the funding for the new study.          But each cell uses only a small part of the genome, so that a cell from the liver, for example, would use a different part of the script to one from the brain.          To do this, cells contain molecular machinery that carries out the instructions held in particular genes, converting them into a second kind of genetic material, called RNA, which is in charge of the manufacture of the necessary range of proteins to build and operate each cell type.          A decade ago, most scientists speculated that because humans are so complex, it would probably take 100,000 genes to describe the awesome workings of an entire body, perhaps as many as 300,000. Then, seven years ago, when Francis Collins and Craig Venter unveiled a rough draft of the human genome in the White House, acres of newsprint remarked on how the actual number was closer to 25,000 genes - the same parts list as that of 'simpler' creatures such as the sea urchin.          This entire complement of human genes, it was believed, resided in only around 1.5 per cent of the cell's DNA, prompting some scientists so dismiss vast swaths - the other 98.5 per cent - as 'junk'.          Now the most exhaustive probing of the genome to date, a £20 million pilot project, suggests the meaning of DNA's message remains elusive. Professor Steve Jones, of University College London, describes the seismic implications of the new findings: 'I once wrote a book called The Language of the Genes, but now biologists are beginning to face up to the uncomfortable truth that they have only been looking at the nouns in life's lexicon - the crudest and most basic elements of any tongue.          Now we are reading the spaces in between - verbs, adverbs, adjectives, pronouns and all the rest, and they are complicated indeed. Worse, the genome babbles, stutters and mangles its pronunciation and now and again seems to speak utter nonsense.'          The new understanding has come from an exhaustive analysis of one per cent of the genome, some 30 million letters of DNA, published in the journal Nature by an international team called the ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements (Encode) Consortium, along with 28 companion papers published in the journal Genome Research.          In all, this army draws on expertise from 35 groups in 80 organisations from around the world.          The analysis was led by Dr Ewan Birney, a computer scientist at the European Bioinformatics Institute, near Cambridge, who said the work 'poses some interesting mechanistic questions'. In layman's language, this is an admission that boffins are baffled.          Indeed, Dr Birney said scientists might even have to revise what they mean by the term 'gene'. 'It is really challenging our dogmas,' he said.          The most striking finding is that much of the 'junk' DNA is not rubbish but crucial for staying alive. Instead of finding that just 1.5 per cent of the genome is critical in cells, most of it appears to be active. Using a computer metaphor, junk DNA seems to be the cell's 'operating system' running the genes.          The process - called transcription - that interprets DNA in our cells was traditionally thought to be focused on making proteins. The new work suggests that for every protein, 10 times that number of RNAs are made to control how genes blink on and off, depending on the cell type, showing that RNA is every bit as important as DNA, a fact already being exploited in treatments.          This finding dovetails with the remarkable outpouring of discoveries announced a few days ago by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Whereas traditional gene hunts fished for DNA mutations in genes that cause rare diseases, the consortium's trawls of the genomes of thousands of people have revealed ubiquitous DNA mutations that raise the risk of disease. What has not often been reported is that many of these mutations for important illnesses such as diabetes and Crohn's disease lie in gene-free 'junk.'          By regulating how other genes are used, these snippets of DNA may be powerful triggers for diseases - and may hold the key for potential cures. Collins admitted that the new understanding suggests it will take longer to sort out the mechanics, but there is a silver lining, in that a 'subtle tweaking' of the way a gene is used - for instance by a drug - could help cut the risk of a disease.          The new work identifies many more kinds of genetic punctuation that control how genes are read, amounting to 35 per cent more than previously recognised. No wonder, given our poor understanding of these control mechanisms, splicing new DNA into the genome by gene therapy has proved so difficult.          Groups also compared the DNA sequences across humans and other creatures, from baboons to hedgehogs. Remarkably, some five per cent of the genome - DNA other than that found in genes - is almost the same, suggesting it plays a crucial enough role for evolution to preserve it while species have evolved.          When scientists compared the working elements in the human to genomes of different animals, up to 70 per cent differed. As Collins put it, these working elements are 'clutter in the attic'. According to our current understanding of evolution, these genes would, like attic junk, decay over the generations, so the idea that they are being saved for a rainy day appears at odds with existing opinion. Dr Birney admitted that this idea had already been attacked as heretical.          This could have major implications for the use of animals in research, said Dr Birney. 'It means, for example, that how the kidneys work in mice and humans is not the same - not all of those bits of biology will use the same DNA; that is, remain the same between different mammals.' In other words, lab mice may differ in some respects from us, which is a major shift from the current position that, at the genetic level, we are pretty much big, tailless rodents.          The scientists who have gazed down a microscope to watch DNA at work may not be surprised by these revelations.          Only when the DNA in a chromosome unravels does a cell begin reading its message. Then the one-dimensional DNA script forms a 3D spaghetti-like mess as a vast interacting network of RNAs turns its orders into action. To reveal more secrets, the team now plans to finish the job with another £50 million. After four more years, they will probably prove the first law of biology: life is always more complicated than you think. "
telegraph,19/05/2015 00:01,news,"An injection of newly discovered stem cells could encourage the heart to regenerate and reverse damage, scientists believe  Stem cells capable of repairing the irreversible damage of a heart attack have been discovered by scientists in a breakthrough which could offer new hope for hundreds of thousands of Britons.  Many heart attack survivors are left suffering breathlessness and tiredness because their muscles are so badly damaged that the heart can no longer pump blood effectively.  Scientists have hoped that an injection of heart stem cells could encourage the organ to repair itself but have struggled to find cells which had a significant effect.  Now, researchers at the British Heart Foundation and Imperial College have discovered that a particular type of stem cell in the heart is crucial to the regeneration process. After the new stem cells were injected into damaged hearts they were able to pump double the amount of blood as before.  Although so far the cells have only been found in mice, the team are hopeful that a similar regenerating cell should exist in humans.  Professor Michael Schneider, of Imperial College, who directed the research said: “We have found stem cells in the heart that have a specific protein on their surface have the greatest potential to repair damaged hearts.  “When we injected stem cells with this protein into damaged hearts, we saw a significant level of heart repair.  “Future treatments could be injections of stem cells, as in our current experiments, or use of the healing proteins that these cells make.”  • NHS calculator predicts when you will have a heart attack  • Handshake strength 'could predict' heart attack risk   •Short people more likely to develop coronary disease   This study discovered that stem cells with heart repairing properties carry an identifying protein on their surface, called PDGFR?.  The scientists were able to use this protein to find, purify and multiply enough of these stem cells so that they could be injected into damaged hearts.   Stem cells could be injected directly into the heart to repair it  Mice treated with these stem cells were able to recover and repair a significant proportion of their damaged heart muscle after 12 weeks, preventing heart failure, when compared to mice who had not received the treatment.  The researchers now hope to find a similar cell in human hearts, using PDGFR? and other proteins to identify and purify the best stem cells to repair the damage caused by heart attacks.  Professor Jeremy Pearson, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation which part-funded the study said: “This research is an early but important step towards understanding how we might be able to encourage stem cells in failing hearts to repair the damage caused by a heart attack.  “A crucial next step for this research will be to establish if the human heart has similar heart-repairing stem cells to those pinpointed by this method in mice.”  The research was published in the journal Nature Communications.

telegraph,28/03/2008 00:01,comment,"As a member of the All Party Parliamentary Pro Life Group, I have no objection to the Government updating legislation on fertilisation and embryology research. However, like an increasing number of my colleagues, I do have grave concerns about some clauses in the new Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill.                                                      Gordon Brown grants free vote on embryos                                                                         Embryo Bill: How Catholics used their power                                                                        Church wins battle over embryo Bill                                             These 'embryo clauses' will allow the creation of human embryos for no other purpose than to harvest their body parts. Similarly, a growing number of MPs have concerns about clauses that will allow human tissue to be fertilised with animal tissue, and vice versa. These so-called hybrid embryos strike at the very heart of bio-ethics. Some church leaders have labelled them 'Frankenstein clauses'. While I support the development of wider embryology research, I will only do so if the life status of the human embryo is fully protected. The draft Bill puts that special status in peril.         Supporters of these clauses claim that, unless scientists can experiment on human embryos, then the treatment of diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheheimer's, and muscular dystrophy will be put back years. If there were no other science available, this would indeed be cause for concern. But the evidence points in another direction. For it is 'alternative' stem cell research that is providing the breakthroughs in science. That is why recent advances in stem cell science are rapidly making the need for human embryo research redundant.         The Government needs to recognise these advances and to drop the out-dated human embryo clauses from the Bill. The case for not using human embryos was underscored in New York last week, when scientists extracted cells from a mouse suffering from Parkinson's disease and used the same mouse's skin cells to successfully treat the condition. The Church should take comfort. It is science itself that is negating the need for experimental human embryology research.         Scientists, however well-meaning, need to be less 'absolute' in their claims that somehow human embryo research alone provides the Holy Grail for many of the world's diseases. It is also misleading to suggest that stem cells can only be extracted from human embryos. Stem cells can be taken from a range of tissues - placentas; amniotic fluids; bone marrow, fat from liposuction; umbilical cord blood; as well as skin. This is confirmed by the actions of leading scientists, such as Shinya Yamanaka and Ian Wilmut, who have transferred their attentions to skin stem cell research.         Today, breakthroughs in adult stem cell science are used to cure thousands of people with all sorts of illnesses. By contrast, there has been no recorded case of a single patient who has been cured of any disease using human embryonic stem cells, a small detail omitted by the large bio-tech corporations that stand to make millions from the Government's proposals.         It is also misleading of some scientists to suggest that the Church is against stem cell research. The majority of clergy support umbilical cord stem cell research; adult stem cell research; and embryonic germ cell research. Many do object to the eugenic experiments with human embryos. It is human embryonic trials that are an assault on the sanctity of life - not all stem cell research.         The Church also needs to be informed, reasoned and measured when commenting on scientific research. Science is not the enemy of religion; and religion is not the enemy of science. I hope that bishops will refrain from attacking science and perhaps take a little more time to consult the eminent scientists within their own ranks.         From the time of Thales to the present day, science continues to provide humanity with much-needed medical and technological respite - extending years and improving the quality of life for millions. Indeed, it is modern advances in forensic and genetic science that have allowed biblical archaeologists to verify and validate many of the Church's own teachings. The Church's verdict on science should be a positive one, and it would be a miscalculation if the Church attempted to discredit science's major contribution to improving the human condition simply to try to discredit the Bill.         Surveys suggest that more than half of the world's leading scientists belive in God. This should come as no surprise - some of history's greatest scientific discoveries were made by people of faith: Pascal; Faraday; Morley; Bacon; and others. For many of these great minds, the genesis of their inquiries was their belief in a Maker of the order they saw around them.         The Church might occasionally remind itself that, for many people of faith, the greatest scientist of all is God himself: 'In him, and through him, all things were made.' It is regrettable, that so often, science and religion are like cosmic cousins - sharing the same DNA, but rarely seen in public together. After all, history reveals that Luke, a doctor and scientist, was one of Christianity's most effective advocates.

telegraph,1/8/2014 6:01,news,"As the Government announces a huge, pioneering project to sequence 100,000 genomes, Mark Henderson looks at what needs to happen to make the technique live up to its promiseA few years ago, I spat into three test tubes and dispatched them special   delivery to companies that will now, for a few hundred pounds, test your   genes for clues to your future health. Though each service examined the same   DNA, and evaluated the same diseases, each set of results was dramatically   different. My lifetime risk of glaucoma, an eye condition, was as low as 2   per cent or as high as 36 per cent, depending on which service I chose to   believe. One company thought my chances of a heart attack were twice as high   as another. Mine was the sort of experience that has fed a growing sense that the   sequencing of the human genome, heralded by Bill Clinton in 2000 as the   future of medicine, has failed to deliver on its promise. While DNA has   since become much cheaper and simpler to read – the cost of a human genome   is dipping below the magical figure of $1,000 a time – its meaning remains   devilishly difficult to interpret. As my results demonstrate, this is   especially true of the conditions that are the greatest causes of morbidity   and mortality – diabetes and heart disease, stroke and mental illness. More than a decade on from the sequencing of the genome, we remain unable to   use it to predict with any confidence which common diseases an individual is   likely to develop, and the genomic age has not yet yielded new drugs with   which to treat them. Given headlines that once promised personalised gene   screening and therapies, it is easy to understand why figures such as Lord   Winston and Professor Steve Jones have attacked the idea of a genomic   revolution as nothing but hype. Why, then, is the Government today announcing an investment of almost £300   million in Genomics England, a new initiative to read and decipher the   genetic codes of 100,000 NHS patients? The answer is that the critics of   genomics are right that it does not represent the future of medicine.

But   quite staggering progress has been made elsewhere. In three areas in   particular – cancer, rare congenital diseases and infections – the   plummeting cost of reading DNA and science’s growing ability to interpret it   is already transforming medical practice. The Genomics England project is   about bringing these benefits to NHS patients, and enabling further   scientific discoveries to emerge from their care. Many of the patients who are sequenced by Genomics England will be sick with   cancer. A disease of the genes, cancer is caused by mutations in DNA that   cause cells to divide unchecked. By analysing these mutations, doctors can   get a better idea of the character of a tumour – how it is likely to grow,   what the prognosis might be, and, critically, how best to treat it. A small   battery of precision drugs that target tumours carrying particular mutations   is already available – some, like the melanoma drug vemurafenib, developed   in short order with direct insights from the human genome sequence. Genomics   England will allow more patients to benefit from what is already known about   cancer genomics, and generate fresh insights that will benefit others in   future. The other group whose lives are already being transformed by genomics are   families afflicted by congenital disorders. While individually rare, these   are collectively common, and they are heartbreaking. A child is born with a   developmental disorder, typically involving learning difficulties and   skeletal abnormalities. While the cause is clearly genetic, doctors are   often unable to give the syndrome a name, let alone give parents a   prognosis, or tell them whether future children might be affected. The child   will undergo test after invasive test to find out what is wrong. Answers are   rare. Genomics is changing that. The Deciphering Developmental Disorders project,   funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Department of Health, has already shown   that by sequencing the DNA of parents and child, it can be possible to   pinpoint the mutation that is responsible. This rarely suggests a treatment,   but it has huge benefits nonetheless. Parents can be advised whether future   children could be affected. They can also find out how other children with   the same mutation have developed, and thus what the prognosis for their   loved one might be. It can make it simpler to obtain a statement of special   educational needs. Above all, there is peace of mind. Infectious disease is the next frontier. By sequencing the DNA of germs that   cause disease, it is now possible to track the routes by which infections   are transmitted, and to identify the drugs to which a pathogens are   resistant. This improved diagnosis will be key to containing outbreaks of   hospital superbugs, such as MRSA and protecting the antibiotics to which too   many diseases are developing resistance. Genomics, then, is changing lives and improving health today. But it is doing   so principally for people touched by illness in some way – cancer patients,   children with developmental disorders and their families, and people with   infectious diseases. It is not, yet, bringing advances of much significance   for the worried well. The type of consumer tests I took, with such divergent   results, are a distraction from the real story, which is of targeted   clinical diagnostics and treatments for serious diseases, which are already   having a real impact. These applications of genomics have not been oversold.   If anything, they have received rather less attention than they properly   deserve. The big challenge is not to live up to the hype, but to ensure that   as many patients as possible actually benefit.

dailymail,17/05/2015 19:56,wires,"C.J. Nitkowski had nothing to lose in spring 2011. The rotator cuff in his left shoulder that he'd relied on during his decade as a major league pitcher was in tatters. He was 38 and his fastball traveled a Little League-worthy 50 mph.Surgery and the ensuing lengthy rehab would have killed his career. So Nitkowski paid $3,000 to have stem cells extracted from his waist, separated then injected back into his shoulder.'I look at it as a last shot,' Nitkowski said.The ensuing 'boost' he felt helped him sign a minor-league deal with the New York Mets in 2012. Though he never made it back to the majors before retiring in 2013, Nitkowski is confident he'd wrung out every last ounce of talent. While not an advocate for stem cell therapy, as one of the few athletes who have gone public on the treatment he understands why active players approach him about it.'I can't give a recommendation,' Nitkowski said. 'I can only tell my story. I feel like, based on what I believe, that (stem cell therapy) would almost become like maintenance ... if they generate tissue.'That 'if' remains problematic for professional athletes and teams that pay them millions. Several years after Nitkowski's procedure, debate on stem cell therapy for helping rehab injuries is no closer to resolution.Blame it on a lack of study and still-evolving knowledge about what stem cells can and can't do. Blame hype that typically accompanies every new method that attempts to quicken recovery from serious injury.Players and agents are paying attention.'They want the cutting edge, anything that is cutting edge that can get their guys a couple more years in the league,' said Dr. Jim Bradley, orthopedic surgeon for the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers. 'If I was an agent, I'd want the same thing.'Yet while Bradley is bullish on its potential, he spends a fair amount of time explaining what exactly stem cell therapy does, ostensibly. Adult stem cells are undifferentiated cells found throughout the body that can divide rapidly and help repair tissue. The belief is that stem cells can serve as reinforcements to an injured muscle or joint.But nearly all evidence is anecdotal — no definitive lab results show it works. That has done little to damper interest.'Everybody wants answers right now and you can't have them right now,' Bradley said.At least not in the United States, where medical regulation is more restrictive than elsewhere. To avoid scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration, stem cell doctors generally perform same-day procedures similar to what Nitkowski received. That's not the case overseas.Clinics in various countries in Europe, Australia and Asia offer far more aggressive therapies. Patients can have stem cells taken out then grown in a laboratory for weeks, producing millions more cells.Bradley believes those countries are 10 years ahead of the United States on stem cell therapy. He has referred some patients (not Steelers, following team policy) to a practice in the Cayman Islands he considers safe.Athletes who go outside the U.S. generally do so quietly. News reports said Peyton Manning traveled to Germany in 2011 while recovering from neck surgery, but Manning hasn't spoken publicly about the issue. Tennis star Rafael Nadal had stem cell treatment in 2014 to help his ailing back but hasn't endorsed the procedure.Pro teams in the United States can't prohibit players dealing with injuries from seeking as many opinions as they want. But teams don't automatically endorse treatments.'If the player does something we're not recommending, it's more or less on them,' Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert said. 'We firmly recommend that you stay here.'The doctor who treated Nitkowski, Dr. Joseph Purita, gave stem cell therapy to pitcher Bartolo Colon in the Dominican Republic in 2010. Colon later tested positive for testosterone and was suspended 50 games. Purita denied giving Colon any performance-enhancing drugs but the circumstances only discouraged teams.'Traveling to a place like the Caymans, that's like saying 'I'm going to Mexico to have an appendectomy to save $80,'' said Dr. Matthew Matava, head physician for the St. Louis Rams and the NHL's St. Louis Blues. 'It looks like it's not very smart or you're grasping at straws.'In some ways, research on stem cells remains in the embryonic stages.'There is so much hype, so much marketing,' said Matava, president of the NFL's Physician Society. 'The market kind of outpaces the research and the validation.'Dr. Freddie Fu, head physician for University of Pittsburgh athletics, takes his skepticism farther. Fu's had stem cells in his lab for 15 years but refuses to use them on humans because of uncertainty, including unpredictability of what manipulated cells will do once introduced to a new area.'You can have one cell be Obi Wan Kenobi, the other is Darth Vader,' Fu said. 'You're not sure which way it's going to go.'Fu is all for progress. Yet for all of sports medicine's advances over the last half-century, some laws of nature remain intractable.'If you get hurt, it's going to take time to heal,' Fu said. 'It's a part of life. There's always a way to think that maybe something is better, but it might not be.'"

Modern geneticsplicing makes it possible to combine genes from completelydifferent species to produce much-needed products, includingpest-resistant and high-yielding crops.The Bt gene from pest-resistant bacteria, for example, hasbeen inserted into cotton to create a pest-resistant Bt cotton.The combination has greatly raised yields and reduced pesticideuse. But some activists condemn this as a crime against nature.When fears about genetically modified foods first arose,little was known about gene flow, also called horizontal genetransfer. The idea that genes could jump across species violatedthen-conventional wisdom. But scientific research hasestablished that natural gene transfers regularly occur. Sogenetic transfers are not a human invention - just a belatedhuman effort to imitate what nature has been doing all along.This discovery has convinced some longtime campaignersagainst genetically modified crops to make a U-turn. Britishauthor and journalist Mark Lynas, for example, converted frombeing an activist opposed to genetically modified food to a firmsupporter in a notable 2013 mea culpa speech, in which heapologized for letting his opinions trump the scientific data.Scientists once thought that gene transfers occurrednaturally only in simple organisms like bacteria. But researchshows that transfers are also common in complex species,including human beings. Does this genetic intrusion make humansa monster species? Hardly.The 'Economist' used the headline 'Genetically ModifiedPeople' for a report on genetic research by Alastair Crisp andChiara Boschetti, the two Cambridge scientists. They haveidentified 145 genes that have crossed over from other speciesto humans.This is, of course, a tiny fraction of the 20,000 odd genesin a human body. Why then should environmentalists lose sleepover the introduction of a single alien gene into crops?Research on gene flow is still in its infancy. It couldultimately reveal thousands of alien genes that have enteredhuman DNA. This should be no surprise: Nature has had almost amillion years to do its work.One gene identified by the Cambridge researchers helps holdcells together; it crossed over into humans from a fungus.Marine algae appear to be the source of another human geneassociated with fat mass. Bacteria have provided a third genethat helps define blood groups.Apart from human transfers, the scientists examined genetransfers in nine other primate species, 12 fruit fly speciesand four nematode worms. They found that the phenomenon wasubiquitous. The researchers considered the possibility that whatlooked like gene transfers between species might actually begenes both had inherited from a common ancestor millions ofyears ago.Genes found in another animal could be a common ancientinheritance. But genes in animals that came from plants orbacteria would almost certainly represent gene flow. Crisp andBoschetti found that, on average, worms had 173 gene transfers,fruit flies 40, and primates had 109. Humans, with 145transfers, were more genetically modified than other primates.The researchers found two imported genes for amino-acidmetabolism, 13 for fat metabolism and 15 for modifying largemolecules. They identified five immigrant genes that generatedvaluable anti-oxidants, and seven that aided the immune system.Far from creating monsters, the scientists found that genesfrom alien species appear beneficial. Activists againstgenetically modified organisms can argue that natural genetransfers have been spaced out over millennia, giving speciestime to adapt. But every time a natural gene transfer occurred,it carried the same risks as the insertion of a Bt gene intocotton or eggplants.Besides, all crops, genetically modified or otherwise, arefield-tested for safety before commercial release. The UnitedStates has approved dozens of genetically modified crops forcommercial use. Virtually all U.S. corn and soybeans today aregenetically modified.Chipotle's claim of serving food free of geneticmodifications is dubious because the meats it serves come fromanimals and chickens likely fed on genetically modified corn andsoybean meal. More important, why should Chipotle even make theclaim when its own customers are genetically modified? (Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar)"
telegraph,23/01/2012 16:18,news,"Scientists have improved the sight of two people who were almost blind by injecting their eyes with stem cells from embryos. The two women, both registered as blind, saw their vision improve in a matter   of weeks after being given the embryo-derived cells in the US safety trial. The breakthrough holds out the hope of a cure in the future for age-related   macular degeneration, which currently affects some 500,000 people in   Britain. The results, published   this week in The Lancet, provide a major boost for the field of   stem cell reseach. Professor Daniel Brison, of the North West Embryonic Stem Cell Centre in   Manchester, said: “This is a very exciting moment for embryonic stem cell   therapies. This is the first peer-reviewed scientific report showing that cells derived   from human embryonic stem cells can be transplanted safely into a patient   with no sign of complications. 'Although the study is limited to safety considerations, very small in   scope, and at a very early stage, this is nonetheless a ground breaking   moment for embryonic stem cell therapies.'Meanwhile, a British man has become the first European to be treated with   embryonic stem cells, at the Moorfield Eye Hospital in London, which is   running a parallel trial. Both the women in the US study arm suffer from forms of macular degeneration -   worsening central vision - that are caused by retinal cells dying. The first, in her 70s, suffers from dry age-related macular degeneration, the   leading cause of blindness in the West. She went from being able to read 21   letters on a sight test chart to 28. The second, in her 50s, suffers from Stargardt's disease, the most common form   of macular degeneration in younger patients. She went from only being able   to detect hand movements, to being able to see finger movements and better.   Both received the stem cell treatment last July. Researchers at the Jules Stein Eye Institute at the University of California,   Los Angeles, also found no safety concerns with the two patients, four   months after they were treated. Each patient had a single eye injected with about 50,000 retinal pigment   epithelium (RPE) cells that had been derived from embryonic stem cells. In   this way, vision in one eye could be compared against vision in the other. Dry age-related macular degeneration is caused by death of RPE cells in the   retina and subsequent loss of light receptive rod and cone cells beneath   them. In Stargardt's, the same cells are lost, but this is caused by a   genetic defect that starts to show in teenagers. The theory is that the new RPE cells, developed by US stem cell company   Advanced Cell Technology (ACT), will help repopulate the epithelial layer,   which will improve the health of the underlying rods and cones. Dr Robert Lanza, chief scientific officer at ACT and one of the study authors,   commented: 'Despite the progressive nature of these conditions, the   vision of both patients appears to have improved after transplantation of   the cells, even at the lower dosage. 'This is particularly important, since the ultimate goal of this therapy   will be to treat patients earlier in the course of the disease where more   significant results might potentially be expected.” He and his co-authors emphasised that the study, which will be into 24   patients, was currently only 'designed to test the safety and   tolerability' of the technique. Meanwhile, the first of 12 volunteers in the European arm has been injected   with the stem cell derived RPE cells. Marcus Hilton, 34, from Wakefield in West Yorkshire, received the dose in his   right eye at the Moorfield on Friday under general anaesthetic. He is just   the third person worldwide to receive the cells to help vision. Mr Hilton, who runs bars in the town, said: 'I was diagnosed with   Stargardt's at 10 and I have pretty poor central vision. 'Nobody had been able to do anything about it until I was contacted last   November by Moorfield.'He said it was too early for there to have been any effect, but he would be   returning to the hospital in March for an assessment. He said of the US findings: 'I'm over the moon they have had early   results in America showing this treatment could work. 'It could change many people's lives - to have some sight restored would   be a dream come true.' If it worked it would enable him to read to his four-year-old daughter Amelia,   he said. Professor James Bainbridge, who is leading the European trial, said: 'There   is real potential that people with blinding disorders of the retina,   including Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration, might   benefit in the future from transplantation of retinal cells. 'We are very pleased that the first transplant surgery has gone smoothly   and look forward to seeing the results as the trial progresses over the next   2 years. 'While this is primarily a safety trial, we will have the opportunity to   monitor engraftment of retinal cells and to assess any impact on sight.' The US trial is the first to report results of a trial using human embryo   derived stem cells in a peer-reviewed journal, although not the first to   initiate treatment. In October 2010 a paralysed man in Atlanta, Georgia, became the first to be   treated with the cells, as part of a trial funded by biotechnology company   Geron. However, the trial was halted last November for financial reasons. Supporters of human embryonic stem cell research contend that is holds great   hope for the treatment of a range of conditions, including Alzheimer's,   Parkinson's and paralysis. However, the use of embryonic stem cells, which can develop into any type of   cell, is controversial because it requires the destruction of human embryos.   Opponents argue is violates the sanctity of life. President George W Bush stopped federal funding of such research, but this ban   was lifted by President Obama in 2009. "
telegraph,31/10/2004 00:01,news,"The 'biotech revolution', which has been acclaimed by scientists as the path to miracle cures, has not delivered genuine improvements, according to an official study published this week.          Among the scientific breakthroughs attributed to biotechnology - which is based on the analysis of the behaviour of human genes and living cells - are the birth of Dolly, the cloned sheep, and advances in the search for cures for genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis.          Another was the completion of the first draft of the map of the human genome, the complete genetic blueprint of humans, which was described by Tony Blair as 'a revolution in medical science whose implications far surpass even the discovery of antibiotics'.          Earlier this year the Government said that an extra £100 million had been made available to speed the introduction of new drugs, and last month said it would boost investment in research.          A study of the impact of biotechnology on medical treatments, concludes, however, that the claims surrounding gene therapy have been wildly exaggerated and that it is an expensive myth.          It has found that the investment has, in fact, produced only a handful of useful drugs over the past 20 years, and that despite a 10-fold increase in research spending worldwide, the total number of new drugs has remained virtually unchanged.          The study, to be published in the journal Trends in Biotechnology this week, adds that the objective evidence 'provides no support' for the idea of a biotechnology revolution. It also warns of a 'substantial mismatch between the real world and the unrealistic expectations of policy-makers'.          Dr Paul Nightingale of the University of Sussex, the leading author of the study that was funded by the Government's Economic and Social Research Council, said the outcome is likely to be far less impressive than the rhetoric of advocates of biotechnology suggest.          'What we expected to find was revolutionary levels of change, but when we looked at the evidence, what we found was that there has not been much change taking place, and what there is has been happening very slowly,' he said.          Dr Nightingale claimed that only 15 worthwhile drugs had emerged from biotechnology research over the past quarter-century, while, overall, there had actually been a reduction in the numbers of new drugs reaching the market.          Dr Nightingale said that his findings on biotechnology were unlikely to be well-received. 'We've had people screaming at us, but we have the figures,' he added.          The findings support the scepticism of some leading scientists about the most spectacular 'breakthroughs' in recent years.          Dolly the Sheep, the world's first cloned animal, was supposed to be the first step toward developing pharmaceuticals using farm animals. Yet the cloning process has proved extremely difficult, while Dolly died prematurely.          The much-vaunted technique of gene therapy has also yet to cure a single person of any major genetic disorder. To date, only a handful of children with an extremely rare immune disorder, known as X-SCID, have been successfully treated. The trials have since been halted following the discovery that two of the children had developed leukaemia as a direct result of the therapy.          Prof Steve Jones, a leading geneticist at University College, London, said that excessive claims had been made about biotechnology.          'It's clear that the technical advances have been grossly distorted from the start. I would say give it 10 years before deciding, but I would have said that 10 years ago,' he said.          Prof Jones said that the scientific insights offered by biotechnology were remarkable, but increasingly suggested that living organisms were far more complex than anyone believed.          'We still know very little about genetics. Overall, I suspect genetic medicine will prove to be of crucial importance to a few patients, but irrelevant to the vast majority of us.'          Richard Ley, a spokesman for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, conceded that inflated claims had been made in the early days of biotechnology research. He said, however, that the research investment was now beginning to pay off, with new therapies for illnesses such as chronic myeloid leukaemia.'The point is that it takes so long for new medicines to be developed - around 10 to 12 years - and the human genome was completed only four or five years ago. It really is new science in that sense,' he said.          Aisling Burnand, the chief executive of the BioIndustry Association, said that many biotechnology companies followed a code of conduct that forbade inflated claims. 'People have become more cautious, but advances have to come through in order to treat diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease,' she said."
telegraph,16/01/2002 00:00,news,"WE are conceived, are born, live a few decades then die. Every aspect of this sentence, it seems, is now open to question. The science of stem cells, parent cells of every tissue in the body, now offers huge opportunities to repair a damaged body and restore the sick and injured.The idea that we are all allotted three score years is open to challenge, as is the assumption of an inevitable decline with age. Scientists are beginning to understand why we age and, with luck, they may also reveal how to slow the process.These ideas are having an impact. They were explored in the book The End of Age by my colleague Tom Kirkwood, this year's Reith lecturer. We share an interest in genetic instability, the changes in the way man's genetic recipe can limit our lifespan.This, and stem cells, will be the focus of the proposed Northern Genetics Knowledge Park, based at the International Centre for Life in Newcastle. Today, we will know if the Government is to fund us and, hopefully, tomorrow we start gathering a team of doctors, scientists and ethicists.Part of the reason we age is that DNA is under attack. It is bombarded by cosmic radiation. Internally, it is damaged by potent chemicals, free radicals, which are generated as cells undergo their daily functions. Just as an army of railwaymen struggle to repair our ageing rail network, so an array of special repair proteins attempt, with varying success, to patch up our DNA.One possible reason for ageing is the accumulation of damage to the genes which control each cell. My team is studying the 15,000 or so people in Britain who have inherited a mismatch repair gene defect, a mistake in the body's cellular spell checker.When these people develop what should be a relatively harmless bowel polyp, the failure to correct spelling mistakes leads to faults in other genes. Random loss of other genes results in an 80 per cent chance of cancer.T his understanding has already suggested that aspirin and a diet supplement of indigestible starch can slow or stop the progression to cancer. We have been awarded £2 million by the Medical Research Council to complete our Imperial Cancer Research Fund international prevention trial to see if this combination can indeed extend the lives of carriers of this disorder.But there is much more to bowel cancer. One reason that it affects more than 30,000 people a year is that the lining of the bowel is constantly replaced by rapidly dividing stem cells. DNA spelling mistakes can lead to their 'offspring' growing out of control. Thus, the seemingly separate fields of stem cells, cancer and ageing are intertwined.This link is becoming increasingly important. A few days ago it was emphasised once again by a study of a gene called p53 which, when faulty, results in cancer. While trying to breed a mouse with an underactive p53 gene, the Texan group of Lawrence Donehower bred a mouse with overactive p53. This piece of serendipity has revealed mice which are cancer resistant but died young. Their stem cells wear out too quickly.We still have much to learn about the links between stem cells, cancer and ageing. Dolly's arthritis is a case in point. Some believe that Dolly was born old: She inherited old DNA from the sheep that donated the cell used to clone Dolly. This may explain why Dolly's telomeres were shorter than expected.Telomeres are found at the end of chromosomes and stop DNA unravelling - like the plastic bit on a shoelace - and it tends to shorten as we get older. The genetic code of telomeres has the same few 'letters' repeated over and over. In humans, and slime mould, the sequence is TTAGGG. Every time DNA is copied, the end section, where the copying machinery binds, is lost. Without a repair enzyme called telomerase, or something called the Alternative Pathway for Telomere Length Maintenance (which is poorly understood), cells divide until their telomeres run out. Dolly may be more at risk of this than other creatures. Not all cells age this way. Reproductive cells, stem cells and most cancers have active telomerase, but how?I have helped to weigh up the implications of stem cell research for BBC2's series How to Build a Human, which, among other things, explores the role of stem cells in development and ageing.The series is timely. Across biology, various lines of research on disease and ageing now suggest that the answer to many problems lies in understanding stem cells: lose them and you die, lose control of them and you get cancer, harness them and you can transform medicine.

telegraph,28/11/2006 00:01,news,"            Audio: 'We risk falling behind again on stem cell research,' says Sir Richard                                Britain's position as the world leader in stem cell technology is in serious jeopardy because of a lack of funding, one of the country's leading scientists said yesterday.          Sir Richard Sykes, who is the chairman of the UK Stem Cell Foundation's Board of Trustees, warned that the foundation's efforts to test stem cell treatments could end within a year.          Stem cells can develop into all 200 types found in the body and could alleviate illnesses such as Parkinson's disease and conditions for which there is currently no cure. They may one day help rebuild tissue and organs.          The creation of the UK Stem Cell Foundation to bridge the gap between the laboratory and hospital ward was endorsed by Tony Blair, who said the field could 'revolutionise medical research', and the Chancellor.          But the foundation may close 'in the next year if something does not happen', said Sir Richard, Rector of Imperial College London.          'We have not got a penny,' he said. Even a delay in obtaining funding could be harmful, given the intense competition by researchers overseas.          Sir Richard is frustrated because last December the Government announced that £100 million would be made available for UK stem cell research over two years in response to the recommendations in the UK Stem Cell Initiative by Sir John Pattison.          Sir John had chaired the initiative at the request of Gordon Brown, who said that 'Britain should be the world's number one centre for genetic and stem cell research'.          'There was a lot of noise after the Pattison report,' said Sir Richard. 'We believed we would get that matching money from the Government because they were very gung ho about stem cells.'          However, 'it is all bloody noise', he said yesterday. 'They don't do anything.'          The Government has yet to match the funding generated for the foundation's first project, a trial of stem cells to repair the damage caused by heart attacks, which will involve 100 patients.          The £1.2 million trial of cells isolated from the patients' own bone marrow is supported by the London Development Agency and £500,000 from philanthropists. It aims to see if stem cells can improve quality of life and prevent the onset of heart failure, a frequent complication of heart attacks.          The foundation has been wooing potential donors.          'If a donor has come up with money to support a clinical trial in the stem cell area then, from the Pattison report, it should be very clear that the Government offered matching funds,' said Sir Richard. 'Those matching funds have not appeared.'          Future projects that are in jeopardy include one to repair spinal injuries by regenerating nerve cells and others using stem cells for eye, bone and cartilage repair.          'There is no way we can start anything else until we get money,' said Sir Richard.          A Department of Health spokesman said: 'They do have funding from London and Scottish Development Agencies.          If the Medical Research Council and the foundation agree on a joint trial they want to fund then the MRC will match the foundation funding for up to £1 million a year and any extra NHS costs will be funded by the department. They have yet to agree on any joint trials.'          One problem for the foundation is that Sir Chris Evans, the biotech entrepreneur who set up the initiative, has — despite his strenuous protestations of innocence — had to step down after being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office.          He was also arrested in the Labour 'cash for honours' investigation.

telegraph,25/09/2011 08:30,news,"A British clinic is launching a new service to extract stem cells from the fatty tissues of those undergoing liposuction and store it, to treat future diseases.Scientists hope the fat taken from flabby thighs and stomachs could one day be   used to save lives and to protect from a host of conditions such as cancer   and heart disease. Stem cells have already been used to treat burns and wounds, to repair   cartilage in osteoarthritic joints, and more controversially, in breast   enlargement surgery.Now, those undergoing liposuction to shed the pounds are being offered the   chance to store their own stem cells, extracted from their adipose tissue. While the cells can be used to treat a limited number of ailments, and are   currently being used in breast surgery trials, customers are more likely to   be swayed by the hope that future medical breakthroughs mean one day, the   cells could save their life.Some medical facilities in this country will already store stem cells, if they   have been extracted.The service will be launched this week at the annual meeting of the British   Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, in Birmingham.From this week, private company Future Health Biobank, in Nottingham, will be   the first to run a service which takes fatty tissue direct from cosmetic   clinics, separating out the stem cells and storing them for clients for up   to 25 years, at a cost of £1,695 – on top of the cost of liposuction.Dr Julia Irving, the company's scientific director said: 'We are   launching the adipose-derived stem cell bank so people can use their stem   cells in the long-term and we are especially advocating their medical use in   regenerative medicine. There are currently around 40 clinical trials going   on involving its use – we don't know what advances might be made in the next   20 years.'Studies are currently investigating whether stem cells could be used to repair   heart disease, following a cardiac attack, to treat arthritis, diabetes and   to improve the body's immune response in transplant operations. It has already been established that mesenchymal stem cells, the type of cells   found in body fat, can be developed into bone, fat and cartilage. Given the difficulty of predicting advances in science, Dr Irving said those   who store cells could be offered no guarantees about the precise help they   might one day provide, but said the service provided an extra insurance   policy against future disease.Dr Irving said: 'The concentration of such stem cells in adipose tissue   is 500 times higher than bone marrow. However, until recently, no one had   the technology to separate these cells from the fat and then prepare them   for future medical use. Now that we have the expertise to isolate and store   these cells, I believe there will be an increasing interest from those   wanting to develop medical applications, including plastic surgeons who are   constantly looking for ways to reduce rejection and improve engraftment.'The tissue bank already stores thousands of stem cells taken from the   umbilical cords of newborn babies, because of their potential to treat   future disease. Parents pay £1,500 to process, freeze and store the child's   stem cells for up to 25 years. Last year, research in Holland found that stem cells taken from fat on a   patient's stomach improved the heart's function following a heart attack. Results from a small trial of 14 patients, presented at the American Heart   Association's annual conference last autumn, found blood flow through the   heart was three times better for patients who received the stem cells,   compared with those given a placebo. Clinical trials in Glasgow and London are using stem cell therapy to increase   breast volume, in cancer survivors who have undergone a mastectomy, and in   healthy women seeking larger breasts."
telegraph,9/1/2015 22:00,news,"A landmark ruling by the European Parliament is this week expected to give ministers the power to approve genetically modified crops Genetically modified crops could be grown commercially by English farmers for   the first time following a landmark ruling in Europe next week. On Tuesday the European Parliament is expected to approve a deal which will   let countries decide for themselves whether they want to plant GM crops. The new legislation, which will be in place by Spring, could mean that   commercial GM crops including maize and oil seed rape are grown in Britain. The crops, which have been genetically modified to produce higher yields and   withstand higher concentrations of weedkiller, would be sold for animal feed   or to produce energy. It raises the prospect that genetically modified fruit and vegetables could   ultimately be grown for sale in Britain's supermarkets. Lord de Mauley, the environment minister, told MPs that genetically modified   produce are a 'key agricultural technology for the 21st century'. He told the science and technology select committee that it will help 'undo   the logjam' in approvals for genetically modified crops at European   Union level. However, he said he was 'disappointed' that the legislation will   allow other European nations to make decisions to ban GM crops which are 'not   based on scientific evidence'.It is feared that could lead the industry simply to write off the whole of   Europe. He said: 'GM offers the potential to increase production and maintain it   when it might otherwise be reduced with crops that resist disease or pest   damage, or which can thrive in difficult climatic conditions. 'As GM production continues to expand outside Europe and the range of   beneficial GM traits is increased it should become increasingly difficult   for the EU to set its face against widespread acceptance of the technology.   We will continue to engage with them. 'Regardless of the EU situation, we have a world-class plant science base   which could provide commercial opportunities for the development of new GM   crops. 'It will be a key agricultural technology for the 21st century, and it is   important that we maintain UK research in that area.'At present, the European Union has banned the use of a large number of   genetically modified crops because of opposition across Europe. The new legislation will mean member states will be able to decide at a   national level whether to plant GM crops. Lord de Mauley said that that are no genetically modified crops awaiting for   approval which are suitable for growing in England. Experts said that genetically modified maize and oilseed rape were the most   likely crops to be grown in this country, alongside potatoes which require   lower levels of pesticides. They are likely to take several years to gain   approval from regulators. Genetically modified fruit and vegetables are not currently available for sale   in British supermarkets. However, meat from livestock which has been fed   using genetically modified crops is sold. Supermarkets have previously said that they are only prepared to change their   policy and sell genetically modified food if there is demand from customers. Genetically modified crops are being trialled in Rothamstead, Hertfordshire   and Norwich in Norfolk, but they are not be sold commercially. Wales and   Scotland are opposed to the use genetically modified crops and will not be   growing anyway. Lord de Mauley said: 'It could provide an easier route to market for GM   crops that pass the EU safety assessment process, albeit the market will be   limited to those member states or regions that are open to GM cultivation.   We will be pressing for the outstanding applications for EU approval to be   authorised as soon as possible.'Peter Melchett, policy director at the Soil Association, said: 'I hope   that England will learn from the lessons of Scotland and Wales and think   about what's in the interests of the farming industry rather than the   chemical companies. 'The biggest risk is that England gets the reputation of being a GM   country. It wouldn't be a surprise. It could damage exports from England and   if you get a reputation for being an unreliable supplier people look   elsewhere. 'Meurig Raymond’s, President of the National Farmers Union, said: 'If   the European Parliament adopts the text currently tabled, it is supporting   unscientific, emotional and politicised arguments and justifications for   banning an agricultural technology within a single market. “GM could provide UK farmers with the potential for expanding markets and   meeting the challenge of feeding an ever growing population in a sustainable   way. Restricting ourselves from doing this is an outdated and backward step.”Genetic modification involves taking existing plant strains and genetically   engineering them with DNA from other species to produce useful traits, such   as higher yields or resistance to pesticides. But there has been vociferous public opposition to so-called “franken-foods”   in the past. Critics have raised fears of possible environmental damage if GM strains   spread and have argued that they allow chemical companies to “own” plants as   the GM strains are protected by intellectual property law.The prospect of England growing GM crops commercially prompted concern from   organic farmers last night."

The   results will advance medical knowledge ''by years'', scientists said. The £10 million trial, involving up to 200 patients around the world, is due   to start later this year and will last between three and five years. Scientists in the UK have received £1 million in joint funding from the MS   Society and the UK Stem Cell Foundation for the UK arm of the trial as well   as two other studies. Paolo Muraro, lead researcher on the study based at Imperial College, London,   said: ''This is the first time that researchers from around the world have   come together to test stem cell therapies in MS in such a large-scale   clinical trial. ''A trial of this scale would be impossible to run in one location which is   why this type of collaboration is essential if we are to make progress in   this field.'' Researchers at trial sites in London and Edinburgh will harvest stem cells   from the bone marrow of 13 trial participants, grow them in the laboratory   and then re-inject them into the bloodstream. The stem cells will make their way to the brain where it is thought they will   repair the damage caused by MS - including targeting the ''active'' lesions,   where damage is happening. MS is a disabling neurological condition affecting the central nervous system   and symptoms include problems with mobility, eyesight and bladder control,   pain, extreme fatigue and muscle stiffness. Scientists believe the new study will reduce the time taken to test whether   stem cells could be a safe and effective treatment for people with MS by   years, the MS Society said. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the charity, said: ''Stem cells hold   tremendous potential as a future treatment option for people with MS. We are   delighted to be funding this world-leading piece of research which shows the   power of an international research collaboration and joint working between   charities.'' In recent years many people living with MS have been attracted to overseas   stem cell clinics which claim to cure long-term conditions in exchange for   large amounts of money. However there is no proven stem cell therapy available for MS anywhere in the   world. It is hoped these new trials will eventually lead to a proven treatment and a   reduction in the draw of overseas treatments. Sir Richard Sykes, chairman of the UK Stem Cell Foundation, said: 'I am   delighted that by working in collaboration with the MS Society we have been   able to progress these most promising research projects more quickly than by   working in isolation. 'Dr Muraro's research project is the first trial of its kind into the use of   stem cells for the treatment of MS to take place in the UK. Given the high   incidence of MS in the UK in comparison to other countries, I am delighted   that we have at last progressed stem cell research to this stage, which will   bring much-needed hope to so many people affected by this devastating   condition.' Of the two other studies funded by the MS Society and the UK Stem Cell   Foundation, one based at Queen Mary Hospital, London, will look at how stem   cells can be used to repair nerve damage in people with MS who have optic   neuritis, a symptom of MS that can lead to temporary blindness. The other, based at the University of Nottingham, will compare stem cells from   people with a progressive form of MS to those without the condition with the   aim of finding effective treatments. "
telegraph,29/07/2011 13:29,news,"A reliable stem cell treatment for multiple sclerosis could be available within five years if a large-scale human trial proves to be a success. Scientists hope to show that stem cell replacement can slow, stop, or even   reverse damage caused by the disease of the central nervous system. Some 100,000 people in Britain suffer from MS, with symptoms that can include   dizziness and lack of balance, muscle spasms and blurred vision. It tends to   get worse over time and there is no cure. However, later this year an international £10 million trial of up to 200   volunteers will begin looking at the effects of stem cell transplantation. The participants, including 13 in Britain, will have stem cells harvested from   their own bone marrow and grown in a laboratory before being re-injected   into the bloodstream. MS is caused by the immune system attacking a protective substance around   nerve fibres called myelin. Where this happens scars, called lesions, are   left behind. The hypothesis is that the stem cells will target these lesions and repair the   damage. Scientists in London and Edinburgh have received £1 million in joint funding   from the MS Society and the UK Stem Cell Foundation for the British arm of   the trial and two other studies. Paolo Muraro, lead researcher on the study, based at Imperial College, London,   said: 'This is the first time that researchers from around the world   have come together to test stem cell therapies in MS in such a large-scale   clinical trial. 'A trial of this scale would be impossible to run in one location which   is why this type of collaboration is essential if we are to make progress in   this field.'The trial will last between three and five years. In recent years many people living with MS have been attracted to overseas   stem cell clinics which claim to cure long-term conditions in exchange for   large amounts of money. However there is no proven stem cell therapy available for MS anywhere in the   world.

In 2009 American researchers reported they had managed to improve the symptoms   of three MS patients using stem cells derived from fat. Dr Boris Minev, from the University of California, said all had seen 'dramatic   improvement in their condition'. The treatment appeared to stop seizures in one 50-year-old man, who had   previously suffered about 200 a year. The symptoms of the three people continued to improve almost a year after the   stem cell injections, suggesting a long-lasting effect. "
telegraph,19/06/2011 09:15,news,"Human organs could be grown inside pigs for use in transplant operations following research using stem cells. Scientists have found they can create chimeric animals that have organs   belonging to another species by injecting stem cells into the embryo of   another species. The researchers injected   stem cells from rats into the embryos of mice that had been genetically   altered so they could not produce their own organs, creating mice that had   rat organs. The researchers say the technique could allow pigs to grow human organs from   patient's stem cells for use as transplants. By using a patient's own stem cells it could help to reduce the risk of the   transplanted organ being rejected while also providing a plentiful supply of   donor organs. Current organ shortages mean that patients must endure long waiting lists for   transplants. Professor Hiromitsu Nakauchi, director of the centre for stem cell biology and   regenerative medicine at the University of Tokyo in Japan and who led the   research, said: 'Our ultimate goal is to generate human organs from   induced pluripotent stem cells. 'The technique, called blastocyst complementation, provides us with a   novel approach for organ supply. We have successfully tried it between mice   and rats. We are now rather confident in generating functional human organs   using this approach.'Professor Nakauchi, who presented the study at the annual   conference of the European Society of Human Genetics, used a type of   adult stem cell known as induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be taken   from a sample of tissue such as the skin and encouraged to grow into any   type of cell found in the body. Together with his colleagues, he injected these cells taken from rats into the   embryos, or blastocysts as they can be called, of mice that were unable to   grow their on pancreas, the organ that produces important hormones including   insulin. When the mice matured to adulthood, they showed no signs of diabetes and had   developed a pancreas that was almost entirely formed from the injected rat   stem cells. The scientists claim the rat stem cells grew in the niche left by the absent   mouse pancreas and so almost any organ could be produced in this way. If replicated using human stem cells, the technique could produce a way of   treating diabetic patients by providing a way of replacing their pancreas. The project has echoes of the bestselling book and film Never Let Me Go where   clones are used to provide organ donations for the wealthy. In reality   researchers are not allowed to create human embryos that lack the ability to   grow organs and so they hope to do the same using pigs. Professor Nakauchi said they hoped to further test the technique by growing   other organs and were also seeking permission to use human stem cells. They have, however, already managed to produce pigs that were able to generate   human blood by injecting blood stem cells from humans into pig foetuses. He said: 'For ethical reasons we cannot make an organ deficient human   embryo and use it for blastocyst complementation. 'So to make use of this system to generate human organs, we must use this   technique using blastocysts of livestock animals such as pigs instead. 'Blastocyst complementation across species had never been tested before,   but we have now shown that it can work.'Professor Chris Mason, chair of regenerative medicine at University College   London, said: 'There is no doubt that curing diabetes is challenging,   but this could be a potential way forward albeit a very long shot requiring   sustained resources and major finance for its testing and development.''For something like a kidney transplant where it is not urgent, it would   be highly attractive to be able to take cells from a patient, grow them in   this way and deliver a personalised kidney.''There is a long way to go before it could result in useable transplants,   but it is an exciting vision.'"
telegraph,6/3/2005 0:01,news,"It will look like any ordinary mouse, but for America's scientists a tiny animal threatens to ignite a profound ethical dilemma.          In one of the most controversial scientific projects ever conceived, a group of university researchers in California's Silicon Valley is preparing to create a mouse whose brain will be composed entirely of human cells.          Researchers at Stanford University have already succeeded in breeding mice with brains that are one per cent human cells.          In the next stage they plan to use stem cells from aborted foetuses to create an animal whose brain cells are 100 per cent human.          Prof Irving Weissman, who heads the university's Institute of Cancer/Stem Cell Biology, believes that the mice could produce a breakthrough in understanding how stem cells might lead to a cure for diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.          The group is waiting for a key American government-sponsored report, due this month, that will decide just how much science can blur the distinction between man and beast.          Last week, however, the university's ethics committee approved the research, under certain conditions. Prof Henry Greely, the head of the committee, said: 'If the mouse shows human-like behaviours, like improved memory or problem-solving, it's time to stop.'          He accepted that the project might seem 'a little creepy', but insisted: 'It's not going to get up and say 'Hi, I'm Mickey'. Our brains are far more complicated.'          Biologists know such creatures as 'chimeras', after the mythical Greek monster that was part-lion, part-goat and part-serpent.          Prof Weissman said that there was no way of knowing whether the 'human-mice' would develop any human characteristics until after they were born. In previous experiments, pigs with human blood have been developed at a clinic in Minnesota. Last year, the University of Nevada produced sheep whose livers were 80 per cent human and could one day be used for transplants.          An inquiry into laying down rules for research using stem cells from human embryos was launched last summer by America's National Academies of Science. The government-sponsored report, said to be in draft form, will govern stem cell research in the private sector. It comes at a time of growing confusion in America over the limits of stem cell research.          President George W Bush halted government-funded research during his first term of office but several states, including California, have since passed laws that allow support for stem cell projects from local taxes.          At hearings in Washington last October, Prof Weissman argued strongly against a ban on 'chimera mice'. He believes that the mice would behave like any others, but said that he would monitor the experiment closely and destroy them at the slightest suggestion of human-like brain patterns.          Supporters of stem cell research at Stanford University include the actor Michael J Fox, who suffers from Parkinson's disease. Fox provided the voice for Stuart Little, Hollywood's version of the 'human mouse'', who talks, has human parents and lives in a New York apartment.          Opponents of Prof Weissman's work accept that his mice are unlikely to show such obvious human traits, but voice concerns that the brain cells would begin to organise themselves in a way that was more human than mouse. There is growing unease over whether human stem cells could migrate to other parts of the animals, creating human sperm or eggs in their reproductive systems.          Should two such 'chimera mice' mate, it could lead to the nightmarish scenario of a human embryo trapped in a mouse's womb. William Cheshire, a neurology professor from the Mayo Clinic in Florida and a Christian activist, has called for a ban on any research that destroys a human embryo to create a new organism.          'We must be careful not to violate the integrity of humanity or of animal life,'' he said. 'Research projects that create human-animal chimeras risk disturbing fragile ecosystems, endanger health and affront species integrity.''          In a recent article for the conservative Weekly Standard magazine, Wesley Smith, a consultant for the Centre for Bioethics and Culture warned that 'biotechnology is becoming dangerously close to raging out of control''.           He wrote: 'Scientists are engaging in increasingly macabre experiments that threaten to mutate nature and the human condition.'"
telegraph,17/01/2009 08:53,news,"Scientists have claimed a breakthrough in the fight against Aids with a pioneering stem cell treatment that protects the immune system from the virus that causes the disease. Results of a preliminary trial have raised hopes of a new form of therapy for   people suffering from Aids, which occurs in the latter stages of infection   with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The scientists are planning further   research to establish whether the treatment could even rid patients of HIV   infection altogether.The technique involves isolating genes which curb the spread of HIV inside the   body, introducing the genes into human stem cells in a laboratory, then   transplanting the stem cells into a patient's bone marrow.In the first human trial, anti-HIV stem cells were transplanted into five Aids   patients undergoing bone marrow replacement as part of treatment for a form   of cancer known as lymphoma.Small quantities of the transplanted stem cells were able to grow and produce   new white blood cells resistant to HIV, resulting in an improvement in the   patients' conditions.Findings from the trial will be presented this week at the Stem Cell World   Congress in Palm Springs, California. It could take up to ten years before   an effective clinical treatment could be put into widespread use.Around 40 million people worldwide are infected with HIV and an estimated   three million die each year with the virus. In the UK there are 73,000   people who are living with HIV and in recent years a growing number of   heterosexuals have been diagnosed with the infection.'We are trying to prevent the immunodeficiency that is a result of HIV   infection,' said Dr David DiGiusto, director of haematopoietic cell   therapies at City of Hope Medical Centre in Duarte, California, where the   research was carried out.'It is still an experimental treatment at the moment, but we hope that   eventually we will be able to give Aids patients just one transplant and   that would then protect them for life. 'We have data to show that the resistant cells are persisting in our   lymphoma patients.'HIV, which is a sexually-transmitted infection, attacks white blood cells   known as T-lymphocytes, which play a central role in the immune system by   fighting other forms of infection. Over time the number of T-lymphocytes in the body decreases as the virus   spreads and the immune system stops working, leading to the condition known   as Auto-Immune Deficiency, or Aids, meaning patients are no longer able to   fight off infections themselves. Most Aids patients die from pneumonia or   cancers such as lymphoma.Bone marrow contains stem cells that are capable of forming all types of blood   cells including the white blood cells that form part of the immune system. The scientists have found they can import three genes that protect cells   against attack from HIV into these blood stem cells in the laboratory.By giving patients stem cells that carry these anti-HIV genes, the patients'   bodies are able to produce new white blood cells that are resistant to   attack from HIV and so able to defend the body from other forms of infection.The trial of the new stem cell therapy was carried out in patients with   Aids-related lymphoma as the cancer is commonly treated with a bone-marrow   transplant. Powerful drugs are used to strip the patient of their own bone   marrow, which is then replaced with cells from a donor. The doctors behind the research are currently reluctant to expose Aids   patients who do not have lymphoma to the risky bone transplant operation,   but they are refining the technique in the hope of providing anti-HIV stem   cell transplants to all Aids sufferers.They are due to begin a larger trial where patients will be given greater   concentrations of the anti-HIV stem cells in a bid to fight off their   condition.The researchers also hope to develop an intermediate treatment that will allow   Aids patients to be given booster injections of HIV resistant white blood   cells that would help to improve their ability to fight off infections.While the ultimate hope is that the pioneering treatment could rid patients of   HIV infection entirely, this might not happen if the virus, once it has been   prevented from infecting white blood cells, proves able to persist elsewhere   in the body.Dr DiGiusto added: 'This is one of the things we are hoping to look at in   further work, as well as reducing the toxicity of the conditioning   chemotherapy needed to strip the patient of their bone marrow.'What we are doing is genetically modifying a fraction of the patient's   stem cells with genes that target three different aspects of HIV that allow   it to get into the immune cells and replicate. 'When those stem cells are transplanted into patients, they create mature   immune cells that circulate in the patient and protect against HIV.'The early results have been welcomed by Aids and HIV charities who have   described the experimental treatment as 'promising'.Annabel Kanabus, director of Aids charity Avert, said: 'This is very   exciting but clearly it is still in the early stages and has its   complications.'Bone marrow operations are both risky and expensive so for it to be an   effective way of treating the millions of people who have Aids, it would   need to be something that could be given more like an injection.'It is possible to make enormous progress in five years and the epidemic   is still going to be with us in that timescale.'Dr Marilyn Robertson, network director of the Scottish Stem Cell Network and   an Aids expert, said: 'This potentially looks very interesting and the   combination of multiple genes could tackle the ability for the virus to   mutate and get around therapies.'The research is still in its early stages so clearly there needs to be   more work done before it could be used as an effective treatment.'Professor Andrew Brown, an HIV researcher at Edinburgh University, added: 'These   types of studies are very interesting and informative, but it is difficult   to see how they are going to address the biggest problem that we face which   is in Africa.'

telegraph,12/7/2010 6:30,news,"Stem cell ''pharmacies'' that dispense tissue therapies could be as common as chemist shops in 20 years' time, according to a top scientist.Professor David Warburton, one of the world's leading experts on stem cells   and regenerative medicine, said the era of stem cell technology was only   just beginning.In two decades he expected it to yield undreamed-of forms of personalised   treatment for damaged body parts and organs.Speaking on the eve of a major stem cell meeting in Nottingham, he said: ''In   about 20 years' time we will have stem cell banks just like we now have   pharmacies with medicines in them.''You'll get a diagnosis for a specific problem and be given stem cells to   treat that problem.''Stem cells are ''mother'' cells that can be grown in the laboratory and used   to make replacement tissue, such as brain neurons or insulin-producing   pancreas cells.Those obtained from early stage embryos - embryonic stem cells (ESCs) - have   the ability to become virtually any kind of tissue in the human body.Use of human embryos in research creates ethical concerns. However recent   developments have led to ways of ''tweaking'' the genes of ordinary cells to   turn them into stem cells with ESC-like properties.Such research, combining genetics with regenerative medicine, has enormous   potential, Prof Warburton believes.''It's a wonderful time to be working in medical research,'' he said.   ''Genomic research is going to apply stem cell research not only to a   specific disease but to a specific person with a disease. You're going to   have personalised regenerative medicine.''Prof Warburton is based at the Saban Research Institute of the Children's   Hospital, Los Angeles.He has pioneered research into the use of stem cells extracted from the   amniotic fluid that surrounds a baby in the womb.Currently Prof Warburton is working towards clinical trials of kidney   treatments using amniotic stem cells.''These cells go around the circulation, sniff out the damage, and change the   milieu inside the kidney,'' he said.Scientists at his laboratory are also looking at reconstructing lungs using   stem cells - a feat that has already been achieved in animals.Other developments that might soon produce benefits include experimental stem   cell treatments for blood diseases and spinal cord injuries, said Prof   Warburton.The UK National Stem Cell Network annual meeting is taking place in Nottingham   all this week."
telegraph,12/2/2001 0:00,news,"THE latest row in the longstanding feud between the commercial and publicly-funded efforts to interpret the 'Book of Man' broke out yesterday.New doubts were shed on claims by the private venture, led by Dr Craig Venter of Celera Genomics, Rockville, Maryland, that it had done a better job at reading the human genetic code than the public venture, which included Sir John Sulston of the Sanger Centre, Cambridge.The public team had conceded that this was likely to be the case, given that Dr Venter had free access to its data, released each day on the internet. But it could not be sure because of restrictions on the use of Celera data.Yesterday's simultaneous announcement, in the journals Nature and Science, offered the first chance for Sir John and colleagues in 20 teams worldwide to judge Celera's effort.Their conclusion: Celera had underplayed its dependence on public data; it had a less complete genome than the public effort, despite having more data; its much-vaunted faster method for reading DNA had run into difficulties; indeed, its code was in 120,000 pieces that could be stitched together only with the help of public data. Celera's code 'does not look very valuable', concluded Sir John, who was amazed by how far his rivals had failed to live up to expectations.Dr Venter's verdict on Sir John's effort: While two of his finished chromosomes were 'slightly better' than his, the others were scrambled. 'We found that three to five per cent of the pieces of the public data were completely misassembled,' he said, rejecting the claim that he was dependent on public data.He added: 'It keeps wanting to turn into a contest about whose is bigger and better. That is not what it is about.'In broad outline, both teams use the same approach. They manipulate pieces of human DNA by growing it in bacteria. They use the so-called shotgun approach, when many copies of the genome are broken up randomly into pieces that are small enough to read with machines. Both compare the pieces, look for overlaps in genetic code, then reassemble the genome.Fearful that it would be too difficult to put the pieces together again - particularly given that half of the genome consists of repeats - the public consortium introduced an intermediate step, where relatively large chunks of the genome are put in the right order to help locate the smaller pieces.Celera, meanwhile, hoped to use a supercomputer and clever computer programs to put all the pieces from shotgunning back together. But the Science paper reveals they have assembled not one but two genomes, called the whole genome and compartmentalised genome.The first is what they originally wanted to do, but has clearly not performed as expected. 'The whole genome assembly method has not worked as hoped. It has not given them enough continuity to reasonably map on the human genome without leaving a lot of gaps,' said Sir John.The second, on which their analysis is actually based, is really a layering of their data, region by region, on the public consortium data. Sir John's reading of the Science paper suggests that Celera used five genomes-worth of shotgun data plus another seven genomes-worth of public data; in other words, they were more dependent on public data than their own. But Sir John concedes that at present some of the public genome is wrongly ordered because it has not yet gone though the finishing process.In the Science paper, Dr Venter's team said that, when it compared its code with that of the publicly-funded project, it found many more 'breakpoints', that is mis-assemblies or genetic variations, than in their version of the human genetic code. And it said that it has 240 million letters of genetic code - eight per cent - which is not in the publicly-funded data set held by GenBank.Overall, Sir John said he was disappointed that Celera had not done better. Dr Venter said he did not take the criticism seriously: 'We know that our data will stand the test of time.'"
telegraph,22/11/2007 19:00,news,"Thousands of patients with ailments such as multiple sclerosis and sickle cell disease have been given new hope that cell transplants could offer a more effective way to treat them.          An important step towards the goal of transplanting the parent stem cells that give rise to red blood cells to treat genetic blood diseases, such as sickle cell disease, is reported by an American team.          Using the same method, it should be possible to treat a person with an autoimmune disease, such as multiple sclerosis, in which immune cells attack the person's own body.         An immune system transplant, much like a liver, kidney or heart transplant, would give the person a different set of white blood cells that might not attack the body, offering an effective treatment.          Bone marrow transplants are already used to, in effect, transplant stem cells that make healthy white and red blood cells from one person to another but it is necessary to wipe out the old bone marrow first with radiation, which damages other tissue and can cause lasting effects including infertility, brain damage and an increased risk of cancer.          Now an elegant and more efficient way to achieve the same result, by focusing only on the stem cells of the body's blood and immune system, is reported in the journal Science by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine, California.          The team has found a way to transplant new blood-forming stem cells from a donor into the bone marrow of mice, effectively replacing their immune systems.         Many aspects of the technique would need to be adapted before it can be tested in humans, said lead author Prof Irving Weissman but, when surmounted, the benefits are potentially huge, he said.          To avoid the need to wipe out bone marrow, Prof Weissman, Dr Deepta Bhattacharya and Agnieszka Czechowicz found a way to eliminate only the blood-forming stem cells without affecting bone marrow cells or other tissues, using a toxin that only sticks to blood-forming stem cells, effectively destroying the cells, so implanted cells can take hold.          'It is essentially a surgical strike against the blood-forming stem cells,' says Prof Weissman. When the team transplanted new blood-forming stem cells into the mice, those cells took up residence in the bone marrow and established a new blood and immune system.          In this way, stem cells can be taken from one person who has a good tissue match and these donor cells implanted into a person with autoimmune disease, such as multiple sclerosis, so that the new immune system would likely no longer attack the nerves of the body.         Likewise, in people with a genetic blood disorder such as sickle cell anaemia, the new blood system would not have the genetic mutation, eliminating the cause of disease.          First, the researchers have to develop a way to carry out the same kind of surgical strike on human blood forming cells. They also need to do more animal testing to check the effects of the immune system. Although these steps will take time, Prof Weissman says he considered this work to be the beginning of research that could lead to human studies.          Dr Laura Bell, research communications officer at the MS Society, comments: 'Stem cell studies are an important avenue of research which hold promise in terms of treatments for MS. This early stage study is interesting and we look forward to seeing how the work translates into studies in people with MS.'          'For those whose blood stem cells contain a severe genetic defect such as that causing sickle cell anaemia, replacing them with normal stem cells would enable restoration of normal blood,' comments Prof Edward Tuddenham of Royal Free Hospital, London.         'Bone marrow transplantation has been used for sickle cell anaemia with good results in children, but in adults it is difficult to get the new stem cells to take in the face of rejection by the resident stem cells and their progeny- the immune system.'         'This study is clearly interesting and has great potential. It will clearly be needed to see whether these finding in mice can be translated into benefit for patients,' adds Prof Lars Fugger of the Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit and Department of Clinical Neurology, Oxford University."
telegraph,2/8/2001 0:00,news,"   As dinosaurs rampage through cinemas again, some scientists suggest we could resurrect Tyrannosaurus rex. Mark Peplow and Roger Highfield investigate  THE dinosaurs of Jurassic Park are rampaging across cinema screens once again this summer, brought back to life as computer generated images. But recently, scientists have suggested that we really could resurrect dinosaurs within the next 50 years. Researchers believe that by rewinding evolution, we could transform the humble chicken into a snarling Tyrannosaurus rex.                               Big brother: chickens still retain much of the information necessary to build a set of T. rex dentures tweaking a chick's genes might, therefore, be the first step towards creating a generic dinosaur          Birds are the closest living relatives of the dinosaurs, and many scientists think that their genomes - complete sets of genes - still contain dormant instructions for making fangs and claws. Could they switch these genes back on again? It is certainly a more realistic prospect than the method used in the Jurassic Park films. There, dino-DNA was extracted from the gut of a mosquito that had once fed on dinosaur blood. The mosquito had been trapped in amber (fossilised tree-sap) since dinosaurs roamed the Earth.Yet most scientists accept that a molecule as fragile as DNA could never survive that long. The oldest recovered DNA sequences were mere fragments, extracted from a weevil trapped in amber 125 million years ago. In 1997, a piece of bone from a Neanderthal skeleton found in Feldhofer, Germany, yielded more useful DNA sequences but this sample was only about 30,000 years old.Scientists are now turning their attention away from the badly preserved DNA in fossils and looking instead at DNA preserved inside living animals. The genomes of all birds have evolved from a common ancestor, shared with dinosaurs. Although the evolutionary paths of dinosaurs and birds parted between 150 and 200 million years ago, modern bird genomes could still contain the lost echoes of dinosaur genes. If scientists worked out which genes are identical in all birds, they could create a generic 'proto-bird' genome. A small tweak here or there might produce either a hummingbird or an albatross.If the genes responsible for making feathers or scales grow are found, switching one off in favour of the other might be the first step towards creating a generic dinosaur. Prof Rudy Raff, who researches evolution and development at Indiana University, says: 'The DNA in amber route is simply hopeless. If I wanted to recreate a Jurassic dinosaur I'd start with a bird, because birds are dinosaurs, modified a little.'Once the ancient genome had been recreated in the lab, new embryology techniques could be used to insert the DNA sequences into an egg. The embryo would then develop into whatever the DNA had been coded for - in this case, the first dinosaur to be born in 65 million years. 'If the large investment in genetics and development research continues, we could resurrect a dinosaur within 50 years,' says Prof Raff.But a creature that was nothing more than a scaly chicken would get laughed out of Jurassic Park. Dinosaurs need toothsome jaws to complement their slashing claws. Fortunately, it seems that chickens still retain much of the information necessary to build a set of T. rex dentures. Researchers at the University of Southern California have managed to grow that proverbial rarity, hen's teeth. They added fibroblast growth factor to the beaks of embryo chicks, which subsequently grew small tooth buds, thus wiping out more than 60 million years of evolution.Scientists believe comparative genomics may help to recreate the genes that allow an embryo to produce this growth factor itself. Comparative genomics has already been used to reconstruct a single prehistoric gene. This gene existed inside a type of yeast that lived alongside T. rex 70 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period.Prof Steve Benner led a team at the University of Florida that compared several modern strains of brewer's yeast. This microbe turns sugar into alcohol during fermentation by producing an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Benner's team compared the ADH-making gene in several types of modern yeast, and identified which parts of the gene were common to all of them. Taking this shared ground as a starting point, they worked out a DNA sequence for the same gene in their common ancestor, 'Cretaceous yeast'. Finally, they used this gene to recreate the enzyme as it would have looked 70 million years ago. To their surprise, they discovered that it actually consumed alcohol rather than producing it.The technique is not unlike comparing the facial features of several cousins, and then guessing what their grandparents looked like. In theory, you could use the same technique to reconstruct not just one gene, but an entire genome of about 30,000 genes. Simple, say optimists. All we need is a big enough computer to work out exactly how the genome has evolved.But evolution isn't that easy to rewind. Prof Jeremy Gibson-Brown of Washington University says: 'Comparing the genes of common ancestors can only produce hypothetical dinosaur gene sequences. It is extremely unlikely that this technique could ever predict the correct sequence.'The transformation of the dinosaur genome into the bird genome required millions of genetic changes. A single gene itself may have changed hundreds of times. There is no way that a simple average of modern bird genomes could be extrapolated to produce a dinosaur without an incredible amount of additional guesswork, says Dr John Gatesy, a biologist at University of California, Riverside. 'Reconstructing even one T. rex gene would be impossible, because so many species have become extinct between dinosaurs and birds, and there have been so many evolutionary divergences. A thousand years of genetic research could not overcome this problem,' he says.Even finding the hidden dino-DNA would be tremendously difficult. While all creatures share a few core genes that control the general layout of the body, regulate cell function and turn on DNA replication, relatively few genes are this ubiquitous. Indeed, a gene's function can be drastically modified by its circumstances, or by when it is switched on during development. Dr Ilya Ruvinsky, a genetics researcher at Harvard University, says: 'Often, the difference is not in the genes themselves, but in how they are deployed. And we have no idea how those differences in deployment arise.'A classic example is Down's syndrome, where a duplicate copy of chromosome 21 is mistakenly made. The genes have no defects themselves - but the fact that there are two of them has profound physical and mental effects.Although it may be relatively easy to find which genes control feather growth, it's an entirely different challenge finding genes that last operated millions of years ago. Moreover, the genes are hidden in miles of 'junk DNA', gene sequences that have no apparent function. Resurrecting the lost genes would be like running around an ancient mansion, randomly flipping all the light switches on and off to see which one controlled a lamp hidden behind a locked door. Evolutionary developmental biology (or 'evo-devo') has much more to offer than scaly chickens with teeth.Evolution has, by trial and error, come up with some wonderful solutions to the problems of survival. If we can learn how genetic changes have caused those adaptations, we can potentially make changes of our own. Somehow the 'Jurassic chicken' seems pedestrian compared with the possibility that we might teach our bodies to replace severed limbs or defective organs. 'Various vertebrates, such as salamanders, regenerate limbs. Perhaps this technology could be applied to humans,' says Dr Gatesy. Prof Raff agrees: 'Growth of human organs and tissues to replace defective body parts should not only become possible, it will be the method of choice.'For some, the most interesting puzzles lie further back through the evolutionary maze. Why did our forebears drag themselves from the seas in the first place? Why did single-celled organisms decide that one was no fun and start co-operating? These are the questions at the forefront of 'evo-devo' research.So does this sound the death knell for projects aimed at recreating extinct animals? Not if we set our sights at a reasonable level, says Dr Ruvinsky. 'A great project would be to look at mammoths. They only died out 10,000 years ago, and they're very similar to elephants. We could even get some DNA directly from frozen mammoth carcasses.'While chickens may well contain dormant genes once active in the 'terrible lizards', recreating a dinosaur in the lab is not on the agenda for most scientists. For now, that must remain the sole preserve of Hollywood.There's no moa time The difficulty faced by any scientist who wants to revive Tyrannosaurus rex was emphasised earlier this year by an attempt to recreate a complete genetic sequence from an extinct species of bird, New Zealand's flightless moa.Despite the success of the effort at Oxford University, the head of the team believes that the research has ruled out a controversial proposal made some years ago by a scientist in Hirasaki University, Japan, to regenerate the giant bird, which stood up to three metres tall.Dr Alan Cooper, who directs the university's Henry Wellcome Ancient Biomolecules Centre, said the work had underlined how scientists are unlikely ever to be able to make a Jurassic hen-house, let alone Jurassic Park.His study, published in the journal Nature, was not of the 'nuclear DNA' that contains the genetic recipe of what is thought to be the biggest bird ever. He focused on its mitochondrial DNA, that is the stretch of DNA from mitochondria, the power packs within its cells.Working with colleagues in Spain and London, he managed to reconstruct the entire complement of mitochondrial DNA, which consists of 17,000 genetic letters, in contrast to the body plan of the bird whose genetic recipe contains billions of letters of code.The work was significant because the mitochondrial sequences, though short compared with nuclear DNA, are about 20 times longer than any previously obtained from ancient specimens. 'We were pleased to be the first to obtain a complete mitochondrial sequence from an extinct species, especially because the ABC is a new venture for Oxford,' he said.But Dr Cooper said the experiments 'brought home to us the incredible difficulties of reconstructing long stretches of ancient genetic material'.Even in the relatively small piece of DNA code he studied, it proved a headache to reconstruct highly repetitive sequences, the genetic equivalent of a stutter. Because ancient DNA survives in small fragments, it would prove impossible to link the pieces of repetitive code correctly from the much larger nuclear DNA sequence of the bird. The work seems to rule out the 'one moa time' plan put forward five years ago in Japan.Jurassic Park is impossible, Dr Cooper believes. 'It is critical that we do not become complacent in our conservation efforts and start assuming that we will be able to bring things back to life if they do become extinct.'New Zealand Maoris have opposed experiments to resurrect the extinct moa as they regard anything indigenous as taonga (treasured possessions). This is somewhat ironic, given that the bird was driven to extinction by their ancestors, the Polynesian settlers who arrived in the late 13th century.The birds were naive, unused to human beings and easy to kill. Slow to mature, they are thought to have produced only one chick a year. The last of the 11 species of flightless moa that lived on New Zealand is thought to have died around the end of the 14th century."
telegraph,3/7/2003 0:01,news," An experiment that led to the deliberate creation of a hermaphrodite human embryo was condemned as irresponsible by fertility scientists yesterday.The chimera - named after the Greek monster that was part lion, part serpent and part goat - was formed by placing cells from a newly-conceived male embryo into a three-day-old female embryo.The resulting embryo was part male, part female and could potentially have developed into an apparently healthy foetus.The American fertility doctor behind the experiment claimed the creation of chimeras could eventually be used to treat genetic diseases.But mainstream scientists said the research was pointless and could endanger the reputation of serious embryo research.Chimeras can occur naturally when twin embryos fuse in the womb a few days after conception. The resulting babies contain genetic material from both embryos. If the embryos are different sexes, the babies will resemble boys but have characteristics of both sexes.In the past, researchers have created animal chimeras including a goat-sheep. But the creation of human chimeras is illegal in Britain.The research is yet another challenge to conventional reproduction. Just as the development of clones raised the possibility of children with just one genetic parent, a chimera created by merging two unrelated embryos could have four. Details of the experiment were presented at the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology in Madrid by Dr Norbert Gleicher, the head of a private American fertility clinic.Dr Gleicher and colleagues took cells from three-day-old male embryos and inserted them into 21 female embryos at the same stage of development.Three days after conception, embryos consist of around eight primitive stem cells from which the entire human body and placenta derive.Male cells, carrying the Y sex chromosome, were used to allow the team easily to track the distribution of the donor cells in the developing embryo. After three days, the male appeared to be evenly distributed in 12 of the chimeras, he told the conference. The embryos were destroyed soon after.Dr Gleicher said chimeras could help treat genetic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency.'Scid' babies are born with no immune system as a result of a single gene mutation. The condition can be treated with a bone marrow transplant in which healthy donor stem cells are given to the baby.But Dr Gleicher hopes that one day, parents could use cells from healthy embryos to pass on healthy genes to siblings with the defective gene.Repairing faulty embryos in vitro would increase the number of embryos available for use in IVF treatment, he said.'If you have a defective embryo and you are able to introduce just 15 per cent healthy cells, you may be able at that point to treat single gene disorders,' he said.'Normally you would do this with embryos of the same sex but we did it with different ones as a model. Our primary purpose was to see if this was feasible and I think we have convincing evidence that the answer is yes.' The research has been submitted to the journal Fertility and Sterility. The embryos had been donated for use in research, he said.'I would agree that currently to consider this kind of experiment would be wrong. But now we believe transplants are possible, we could think about experiments in animal models,' he added.Prof Lynn Fraser, a fertility specialist of King's College London, questioned the point of the experiments and whether chimeras could ever be used to treat single gene disorders. 'It's a non-starter. Biologically it's an unsound approach,' she said.'He is talking about putting good and bad cells together at an early stage and there's no way you can guarantee that the good cells would get to the organ system affected by the bad gene.'I don't see how it could be of use in the treatment of single gene disorders.'Prof Alan Trounson of Monash IVF clinic, Melbourne, Australia, one of the pioneers of IVF treatment and stem cell research, said: 'It doesn't make any sense to me. It seems completely flawed.'"
telegraph,15/04/2003 00:01,news," Scientists have finished reading the 'book of life', the three billion letters of DNA that spell out the recipe of a person.Half a century after scientists in Cambridge first unveiled DNA's double helix molecular structure, an international team yesterday unveiled an accurate DNA recipe - genome - of a human being.The completion of the Human Genome Project, ahead of schedule and under cost, was announced yesterday by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium.The largest contributor was the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge, which carried out nearly a third of the work at a cost of £150 million.The effort was welcomed for providing 'the fundamental platform for understanding ourselves' and 'a healthier future' said the Prime Minister and the heads of government of the consortium's six member countries.Scientists also unveiled their vision for the future of genome research in Nature, the journal that published the landmark paper by James Watson and Francis Crick in April 1953.The Watson and Crick paper described the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which contains instructions - coded as a series of chemical 'letters' - needed to build and operate every organism.The human genome project is considered one of the most ambitious scientific undertakings, likened to splitting the atom or going to the Moon.But when it was launched in 1990, many were sceptical - not least because it was then thought it would cost about £2 billion and take until 2005.In fact, the project has cost around £1.7 billion and published its first draft in June 2000, which covered 90 per cent of the gene-containing part - at an error rate of one in 1,000 'letters' - with more than 150,000 gaps.Yesterday's 'finished' sequence contains fewer than 400 gaps and 99 per cent of it has an accuracy rate of less than one error every 10,000 letters.'Never would I have dreamed in 1953 that my scientific life would encompass the path from DNA's double helix to the three billion steps of the human genome,' said Dr James Watson, president of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and first leader of the Human Genome Project.'When the opportunity arose to sequence the human genome, I knew it was something that could be done - and that must be done. The completion of the Human Genome Project is a truly momentous occasion for every human.'When the project began, scientists had discovered fewer than 100 human disease genes. Today, more than 1,400 disease genes have been identified. Prof Allan Bradley, a director of Sanger Institute, said: 'The health benefits could be phenomenal.'The US National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, has set out a series of 'Grand Challenges' to energise the field, such as to understand the relationship between genomics, race and ethnicity.Another aim is to find new technologies that can read the entire genome of any person for less than £650, a challenge already being taken up by the company Solexa, which has come out of Cambridge University.'We will begin to gain valuable new insights into human evolution, as well as human health and disease,' said Dr Richard Gibbs, director of Baylor College of Medicine's Human Genome Sequencing Centre."
telegraph,29/06/2007 12:00,news,"            A study has raised troubling questions about heart trials of stem cells, writes Roger Highfield                  A professor has called for a moratorium on the use of stem cells to prevent heart attacks because the design of some apparently successful trials is flawed.          The evidence that the cells themselves do any good is thin at best, and the most common kind of trial depends on using a placebo that, rather than being neutral, is harming patients, according to a comment published today that warns other doctors not to adopt the same trial design.          The warning comes only days after a new trial on stem cells was announced in the UK, where 60 patients have volunteered to take part and will be injected with their own bone marrow stem cells during routine coronary bypass surgery. Similar trials involving 100 patients are also taking place in London.          But earlier trials show little effect and the only one that has been successful appeared to work because the control group used for comparison did particularly badly, not because the group who received their own stem cells did well, according to a study published today in the Lancet.          The warning is given in a comment written in the journal by Professor Harald Arnesen and colleagues from the Ullevål University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, who conclude that trials to date 'are not convincing.'          The team looked at studies published to date on the relatively new technique of using of a patient's own bone marrow cells to strengthen cardiac function, with one team reporting particularly striking results in 2006.          That trial was conducted at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe Hospital in Frankfurt, where a team under Prof Andreas Zeiher took adult stem cells from bone marrow in the hip and injecting them into the main artery of the heart. The team called for large scale studies using a similar protocol.          'We were very concerned,' Prof Arnesen told The Daily Telegraph, pointing out that three other randomised trials of stem cell transplants published last year 'seem to end up with negative clinical results.' By comparison, the Frankfurt trial was 'surprisingly positive.'          'The intracoronary injection of autologous stem cells (that is from the patients own bone marrow) has been shown to be safe, he said yesterday. But the same could not be said for the placebo.          When Prof Arnesen's team investigated, they concluded that the 'improvement' shown by the patients compared with the control group could be explained by the control group doing particularly badly, with six per cent mortality.          'It is astonishing that it is driven by a very poor outcome in a placebo group. In the present setting this figure is unusually high, as is the incidence of reinfarctions also of 6 per cent reported in the placebo group in the Frankfurt study.'         The team approached the company that made the substance that was injected into the heart as a control, instead of the stem cells. Prof Arnesen said: 'We were really astonished to learn from the producer in Maryland, US, that this medium was never intended or accepted for use in humans at all.'          'We are warning doctors about the dangers of introducing these protocols to thousands of new patients in large studies,' he said. 'We need more research.'          Prof Arnesen said that more fundamental work is also needed to understand how the stem cells are behaving in the body, the dosage and so on. 'We should do more research before we introduce these protocols. A moratorium would be wise.'          As for the response of his peers: 'The atmosphere hasn't been too friendly but we want to get an intellectual, scientific discussion.'          The trial on 100 patients in London will be conducted by Prof John Martin, British Heart Foundation Chair in Cardiovascular Sciences at University College London NHS Trust. Prof Arnesen said he had told Prof Martin of his misgivings. 'I wrote to him immediately and told him he should be aware,' said Prof Arnesen. 'They said they would take this into serious consideration when planning a study in the UK.'          The head of the new UK trail, Dr Raimondo Ascione of the Bristol Heart Institute, University of Bristol, responded: 'The evidence in literature about the efficacy of stem cell is indeed controversial and the interpretation of the results can be conflicting as there are major differences in study design between published works. For instance, the type of stem cells used vary to a large extent (this is a key point), as it varies the number of cells injected, the route of delivery, and the stage of heart disease during which the cells are injected.          Also there is variation in the imaging techniques used to assess the heart before and after treatment to ascertain whether the delivery of stem cells has been effective or not. All these factors may affect the success of a trial. Choosing the best combination of these factors and test it with a double blind placebo controlled trial is the way forward. This has been the strategy for our trial.'"
telegraph,16/03/2005 00:01,news,"A hereditary disease has been successfully treated by Britain's leading centre for gene transplants, showing that the revolutionary promise of gene therapy is at last being realised.           The advance marks a renewed attempt to treat ADA deficiency - called bubble baby syndrome because victims must be protected in a sterile environment - the subject of the world's first gene therapy trial.           The pioneering trial, which began 15 years ago in America, produced results which were, at best, ambiguous. Now Britain joins Italy in managing the first clearly successful treatment of this potentially fatal genetic disorder by using a virus to transplant 'healthy' genes into the body.          The team - Prof Adrian Thrasher and Dr Bobby Gaspar from Great Ormond Street Hospital in London - is one of only three to have reported success with gene therapy, among hundreds of failed attempts.           The team has already used gene therapy to treat another bubble baby disorder.           Last night, Prof Thrasher and Dr Gaspar described how gene therapy had been used to treat Mustaf, four, from London, with a faulty version of the gene for an enzyme called adenosine deaminase (ADA), so that he suffered abnormalities of the immune system, a 'severe combined immunodeficiency' or SCID.          Dr Gaspar said: 'He is doing very well. He looks like a healthy boy. He is in pre-school, and can live a life largely free of restrictions.'           News of the latest success was released at the official opening of the Wolfson Centre for Gene Therapy of Childhood Disease at the Institute of Child Health in London. After the first success using gene therapy to treat this disease by doctors in Milan, the London team launched the ADA trial in 2003.          Mustaf was selected because a bone marrow donor with a good tissue match could not be found and he did not respond well to PEG-ADA, a drug used to replace the missing enzyme.          Mustaf had been born in September 2000 and, within a few weeks, was diagnosed with ADA-deficiency, which stripped his body of the ability to fight infection.           Without treatment, children with the disease rapidly sicken and die.            In November 2003, the team stopped treatment with PEG-ADA and in December a sample of Mustaf's bone marrow was removed for gene therapy.           Stem cells - parent cells of all those in the immune system - were purified from the bone marrow and mingled in sterile blood bags with a genetically-engineered mouse virus containing a normal copy of the ADA gene. The virus implanted the gene in the bone marrow.            Then the boy was subjected to mild chemotherapy to suppress his defective bone marrow cells and, in effect, 'create space' for the transfused GM bone marrow cells to multiply.          Within a short time, Mustaf's body began to make the enzyme again and his immune system was rebuilt.          The ADA clinical trial was funded by the Department of Health, the charity Jeans for Genes, the Primary Immunodeficiency Association, and the Child Health Research Action Trust.           The first gene therapy trials by the team, on another life-threatening bubble baby disease called X-SCID, have been remarkably successful.          Seven children and one adult have been treated at Great Ormond Street, all have seen a significant restoration of their immune system, and none has suffered from any significant side-effects.            The Gene Therapy Advisory Committee insists that approval must be sought for each child in the trial.           'The field of gene therapy has therefore grown rapidly, although unrealistic expectation has overshadowed genuine advances, and has focused attention more on clinical failures and unnecessary mistakes,' said Prof Thrasher.            'The time between the concept of gene therapy emerging and success is no different from that of other significant advances, and the continuing occurrence of side-effects associated with established approaches such as organ and bone marrow transplantation should not be forgotten.'"
telegraph,18/12/2007 17:01,news,"A toddler who had revolutionary gene therapy to cure the rare “boy in a bubble” condition has developed leukaemia after the treatment went wrong.                                       The three-year-old boy, who has not been named, was suffering from X-SCID where children are born without a working immune system and had been given the experimental therapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital to correct the problem.         Sufferers are confined to sterile rooms, dubbed a bubble, to prevent them coming into contact with germs and infections and are rarely able to go outside or mix with other children.         The procedure, to replace the faulty gene, was successful and his immune system started to work but last month he began showing signs of leukaemia, cancer of the bone marrow.         Doctors said the development has come as a blow to the child’s family, who had hoped the treatment would cure their son of a condition which is fatal but now face a new health battle.         They said the family had been warned about the risk he could develop leukaemia because of the treatment.         Prof Bobby Gaspar, consultant immunologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said leukaemia was a treatable cancer with an 85 per cent survival rate and there is hope the boy will recover.         The child has started treatment for his leukaemia as an outpatient and so far the results are 'encouraging’, Prof Gaspar said.         He told the Telegraph: “The family are bearing up.”         Nine other boys with the same condition have also been successfully treated with gene therapy and their families have been informed. They are all being monitored.         Only three or four children are born with the condition in the UK each year.          The only alternative to gene therapy would be a bone marrow transplant, a difficult  and risky procedure involving a long course of chemotherapy.         A perfect match for the boy could not be found and if doctors had proceeded with a partial donor match there was a one in five chance he would die.         The clinical trial at Great Ormond Street had already finished in May last year and newer safer methods will be used in the next trial due to begin next year.         A trial in Paris of 11 boys with X-SCID treated with gene therapy resulted in four developing leukaemia and one died.         Regulators in America reacted by stopping all gene therapy but doctors here continued after discussions with the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee as it was felt that the treatment should be offered to parents as the alternatives were so bleak.         Great Ormond Street has been working with the regulator, the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee (GTAC), since the discovery of the boy’s condition at the end of last month.          Professor Martin Gore, GTAC chairman, said: “My sympathy goes out to the child who has developed leukaemia following gene therapy for X-linked SCID and their family.          “I also feel for the nurses, doctors and researchers in the gene therapy team at GOSH who are utterly dedicated to helping children with serious life-threatening diseases.          “They are a highly regarded and professional group who have counselled families extensively about the risks of gene therapy, including the possibility of the development of leukaemia.          “I know that this child is in good hands and that colleagues at GOSH are doing everything possible to treat this child’s leukaemia successfully.”          The gene therapy involves making a synthetic version of the fault gene in the laboratory which is then combined with a deactivated virus.         Bone marrow cells are then taken from the patient from the back of the hip bones under general anaesthetic and the stem cells taken out.         The stem cells are then mixed with the virus so it carries the new gene into the genetic code correcting around half of the cells.         The corrected cells are then injected into the blood stream of the patient and they implant in the bone marrow and multiply, kick-starting the production of immune cells.         The child does not have to be given chemotherapy or stay in hospital for prolonged periods.         Five children with a similar condition called ada-SCID have also been treated using the same method and all are being monitored for side effects."
telegraph,30/04/2011 19:00,comment,"An imminent European ruling on stem cell research would deprive me, and others who have currently uncurable medical conditions, of hope, says Alasdair Palmer.The European Court is at it again. No, not the court that has determined that Britain must give prisoners the vote, whatever our domestic law says – that's the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The villain this time is the Court that interprets EU directives for member states, and it's in Brussels, not Strasbourg.The issue is stem cells, and the ruling is on whether it is permissible to issue patents on therapies derived from research that uses them. The court's advocate general has given his opinion, which is followed in 80 per cent of the Court's rulings. And in it, the splendidly named Yves Bot claims that any patent derived from stem cells violates human dignity and ethical principles, and so must be banned.He didn't say that stem cell research itself should be banned, but he might as well have. The point of stem cell research is to produce cures. Without patents, it will be impossible for any company to make any money from the therapies that they help to finance – and if they can't make any money, why invest in the first place? The surest way to eliminate stem cell research in Europe is to follow Mr Bot's ruling. And that is precisely what the European Court seems about to do.Last week, distinguished experts from across Europe wrote to the journal Nature expressing their 'profound concern' about Mr Bot's opinion. 'Scientists working in stem-cell medicine,' they said, 'will not be able to deliver clinical benefits without the involvement of the biological industry. But innovative companies must have patent protection as an incentive to become active in Europe.' Eliminate patents, and you eliminate Europe's chances of producing cures. True, the research will go on in other places, where patent protection is allowed. But it will take longer, and any effective therapies that result may be prohibitively expensive for Europeans.I have a personal interest in this, because I have one of the many conditions that are at present incurable, but which might be remedied by therapies that emerge from research involving stem cells. On what basis does Mr Bot propose to deprive me, and the thousands like me, of the hope that stem cell research provides?He seems to think stem cells are equivalent to embryos, and that embryos are entitled to the same respect and dignity as fully formed human beings. But stem cells are not embryos. They have the potential to become them, but then so does almost every cell in your body – including the thousands that you slough off every time you scratch your scalp or pick your nose. I don't suppose Mr Bot thinks those activities should be prohibited, incompatible with human dignity though they often are. But given the logic of his argument, it is hard to understand why not.Even if stem cells were embryos, the next step of Mr Bot's argument would still be legally invalid. Embryos are not, in law, entitled to the same respect and dignity as human beings. If they were, abortion would have to be classed as infanticide. Europe's courts, including the European Court of Justice in Brussels, have not ruled that abortion is the same as murder. On the contrary, they have endorsed abortion as legally and ethically permissible.What, then, is the basis for Mr Bot's claim that it must be unethical to derive a patent from research that has involved stem cells? The answer is that his legal claims seem to me flimsy: what he has are his own ethical convictions, which are no doubt important to him, but surely cannot and should not be the basis for European law.There may be good reasons for restricting stem cell research, but Mr Bot has yet to provide a legally compelling one. If the European Court follows his opinion, it will be a disgrace – and will also provide yet another argument for finding a way to escape its judgments. I only hope that can be done without leaving the European Union. "
telegraph,25/11/2006 00:01,news,"Britain's position as the world leader in stem cell technology is in serious jeopardy because of a lack of funding, one of the country's leading scientists said yesterday.          Sir Richard Sykes, who is the chairman of the UK Stem Cell Foundation's Board of Trustees, warned that the foundation's efforts to test stem cell treatments could end within a year.          Stem cells can develop into all 200 types found in the body and could alleviate illnesses such as Parkinson's disease and conditions for which there is currently no cure. They may one day help rebuild tissue and organs.          The creation of the UK Stem Cell Foundation to bridge the gap between the laboratory and hospital ward was endorsed by Tony Blair, who said the field could 'revolutionise medical research', and the Chancellor.          But the foundation may close 'in the next year if something does not happen', said Sir Richard, Rector of Imperial College London.          'We have not got a penny,' he said. Even a delay in obtaining funding could be harmful, given the intense competition by researchers overseas.          Sir Richard is frustrated because last December the Government announced that £100 million would be made available for UK stem cell research over two years in response to the recommendations in the UK Stem Cell Initiative by Sir John Pattison.          Sir John had chaired the initiative at the request of Gordon Brown, who said that 'Britain should be the world's number one centre for genetic and stem cell research'.          'There was a lot of noise after the Pattison report,' said Sir Richard. 'We believed we would get that matching money from the Government because they were very gung ho about stem cells.'          However, 'it is all bloody noise', he said yesterday. 'They don't do anything.'          The Government has yet to match the funding generated for the foundation's first project, a trial of stem cells to repair the damage caused by heart attacks, which will involve 100 patients.          The £1.2 million trial of cells isolated from the patients' own bone marrow is supported by the London Development Agency and £500,000 from philanthropists. It aims to see if stem cells can improve quality of life and prevent the onset of heart failure, a frequent complication of heart attacks.          The foundation has been wooing potential donors.          'If a donor has come up with money to support a clinical trial in the stem cell area then, from the Pattison report, it should be very clear that the Government offered matching funds,' said Sir Richard. 'Those matching funds have not appeared.'          Future projects that are in jeopardy include one to repair spinal injuries by regenerating nerve cells and others using stem cells for eye, bone and cartilage repair.          'There is no way we can start anything else until we get money,' said Sir Richard.          A Department of Health spokesman said: 'They do have funding from London and Scottish Development Agencies.          If the Medical Research Council and the foundation agree on a joint trial they want to fund then the MRC will match the foundation funding for up to £1 million a year and any extra NHS costs will be funded by the department. They have yet to agree on any joint trials.'          One problem for the foundation is that Sir Chris Evans, the biotech entrepreneur who set up the initiative, has — despite his strenuous protestations of innocence — had to step down after being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office.

The advance marks a renewed attempt to treat ADA deficiency - called bubble baby syndrome because victims must be protected in a sterile environment - the subject of the world's first gene therapy trial.           The pioneering trial, which began 15 years ago in America, produced results which were, at best, ambiguous. Now Britain joins Italy in managing the first clearly successful treatment of this potentially fatal genetic disorder by using a virus to transplant 'healthy' genes into the body.          The team - Prof Adrian Thrasher and Dr Bobby Gaspar from Great Ormond Street Hospital in London - is one of only three to have reported success with gene therapy, among hundreds of failed attempts.           The team has already used gene therapy to treat another bubble baby disorder.           Last night, Prof Thrasher and Dr Gaspar described how gene therapy had been used to treat Mustaf, four, from London, with a faulty version of the gene for an enzyme called adenosine deaminase (ADA), so that he suffered abnormalities of the immune system, a 'severe combined immunodeficiency' or SCID.          Dr Gaspar said: 'He is doing very well. He looks like a healthy boy. He is in pre-school, and can live a life largely free of restrictions.'           News of the latest success was released at the official opening of the Wolfson Centre for Gene Therapy of Childhood Disease at the Institute of Child Health in London. After the first success using gene therapy to treat this disease by doctors in Milan, the London team launched the ADA trial in 2003.          Mustaf was selected because a bone marrow donor with a good tissue match could not be found and he did not respond well to PEG-ADA, a drug used to replace the missing enzyme.          Mustaf had been born in September 2000 and, within a few weeks, was diagnosed with ADA-deficiency, which stripped his body of the ability to fight infection.           Without treatment, children with the disease rapidly sicken and die.            In November 2003, the team stopped treatment with PEG-ADA and in December a sample of Mustaf's bone marrow was removed for gene therapy.           Stem cells - parent cells of all those in the immune system - were purified from the bone marrow and mingled in sterile blood bags with a genetically-engineered mouse virus containing a normal copy of the ADA gene. The virus implanted the gene in the bone marrow.            Then the boy was subjected to mild chemotherapy to suppress his defective bone marrow cells and, in effect, 'create space' for the transfused GM bone marrow cells to multiply.          Within a short time, Mustaf's body began to make the enzyme again and his immune system was rebuilt.          The ADA clinical trial was funded by the Department of Health, the charity Jeans for Genes, the Primary Immunodeficiency Association, and the Child Health Research Action Trust.           The first gene therapy trials by the team, on another life-threatening bubble baby disease called X-SCID, have been remarkably successful.          Seven children and one adult have been treated at Great Ormond Street, all have seen a significant restoration of their immune system, and none has suffered from any significant side-effects.            The Gene Therapy Advisory Committee insists that approval must be sought for each child in the trial.           'The field of gene therapy has therefore grown rapidly, although unrealistic expectation has overshadowed genuine advances, and has focused attention more on clinical failures and unnecessary mistakes,' said Prof Thrasher.            'The time between the concept of gene therapy emerging and success is no different from that of other significant advances, and the continuing occurrence of side-effects associated with established approaches such as organ and bone marrow transplantation should not be forgotten.'"
telegraph,30/08/2001 00:00,news,"DOCTORS have patched up a patient's failing heart using stem cells taken from his bone marrow, it was disclosed last week.In the first operation of its kind, bone marrow stem cells were removed from a 46-year-old man's pelvis and injected into arteries near his heart. The cells should have developed into the constituents of blood. Instead, they migrated to areas damaged by a heart attack and turned into healthy muscle cells which began to beat.The operation highlights the potential for adult stem cells as a treatment for many problems, including heart disease, kidney failure or Parkinson's disease. But it will also be seized upon by pro life campaigners who object to plans to use stem cells taken from embryos as a source of tissue for transplant.Prof Bodo Eckehard Strauer carried out the treatment at the Dusseldorf University Cardiac Clinic where he is director. He said: 'Ten weeks after the transplantation the size of the damage has reduced by nearly a third and the capacity of the heart itself has clearly improved.'Stem cell therapy could be more successful than all other previous treatments put together. 'Even patients with the most seriously damaged hearts can be treated with their own stem cells instead of waiting and hoping on a transplant.'Gaynor Dewsnap, spokeswoman for the British Heart Foundation, said the development was exciting. 'If this is proved to have worked and can be repeated, then this would be excellent news for heart patients, particularly as it avoids the ethical issues which some people have worries about.'The cells used would have the same DNA as the rest of the body, leading to no risk of rejection. It seems very promising.' Stem cells are the body's master cells. They have the ability to turn into a wide variety of other cell types.Those found in embryos, which are at the centre of an ethical row between scientists and pro lifers, are the most flexible and easiest to culture. But more specialised stem cells are also found in adults. Last month a team of British researchers showed for the first time that bone marrow stem cells were capable of turning into kidney cells.The German heart operation was carried out four days after the unnamed man suffered a serious heart attack. He lost a quarter of his heart muscle after the organ was starved of oxygen. The team took stem cells from his pelvis - an abundant source of bone marrow - and injected them into his coronary arteries.Prof Strauer said further tests were needed to confirm the success of the procedure. He has treated six patients, aged between 38 and 67, with their own stem cells since March and said that after a short period they showed similar improvement.Last month doctors attempted another form of stem cell therapy by injecting cells directly into the heart tissue. 'Our results should show that it is possible to do this work without the ethically controversial embryonic stem cells,' said Prof Strauer."
telegraph,22/12/2008 06:55,news,"Doctors in Thailand have warned about potentially fatal results from a risky new beauty treatment – injecting animal stem cells into your face. The therapy is illegal in the West, but according to the Thai newspaper The Nation patients are willing to pay between £2,000 to £20,000 in Bangkok to receive the treatment which is claimed to remove facial wrinkles.'Some patients might go into [anaphylactic] shock after receiving several doses of animal stem cells, especially those who have hyper sensitive reactions,' warned Dr Tanom Bunaprasert, a medical professor at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.Dr Tanom also pointed out that there is no proven medical benefit to the procedure. 'The feeling of a younger face is caused by the placebo effect, not stem cells that are injected into their faces,' he said.Because the stem cells from an alien organism stimulate an antibody response from the human immune system, doctors say they massively increase the likelihood that the patient would reject a donor organ if they ever require a transplant in the future.Other controversial stem cell therapies are also practised in Thailand. Experimental adult stem cell therapy for failing hearts and for peripheral artery disease caused by diabetes are both available only in Bangkok, and some doctors have questioned whether the procedures are a medical breakthrough or just a scam.Thailand is a popular destination for 'medical tourists' seeking often high-quality medical care that may be unavailable or more expensive in other countries.Cosmetic surgery is a particular speciality and is widely advertised.Advertisements claim that a full sex change procedure can be obtained for only around £3000.Dr Tanom also warned against other supposedly stem cell based cosmetic treatments which are widely advertised in print and on the internet.He said that animal stem cell based creams and lotions are of no possible benefit because the stem cells would die long before they are applied to the skin and, besides, stem cells are too large to penetrate the skin and have any effect.Likewise, food products purporting to be beneficially enriched with animal stem cells are a fraud, he said.'Stem cell food has very poor nutritious ingredients,' according to Dr Tanom. 'You eat numerous stem cells every day for a long time from meat, chicken, fish and pork but you don't know it.'  "
telegraph,26/06/2015 10:09,news,"On 26th June 2000, the Human Genome Project announced that they had a sequence of the human genome. Here’s how our understanding of DNA has changed the world since  15 years ago, President Bill Clinton and Prime Minster Tony Blair announced that humanity’s code was definitively cracked: scientists had mapped the genetic blueprint for human beings. Following the success of the £1.7bn Human Genome Project, the White House statement predicted that this “landmark achievement” would “lead to a new era of molecular medicine, an era that will bring new ways to prevent, diagnose, treat and cure disease”.  In the decade and half since this discovery, medicine has made dramatic improvements based on our understanding of human DNA. We’re increasingly able to warn patients of their genetic susceptibility to certain diseases, and to screen out hereditary disorders, such as cystic fibrosis. Personalised medicine, which tailors drugs according to the patient’s specific DNA, has also become a reality. DNA-based cancer treatment is expected to become routine within the decade, effectively turning the disease into a manageable condition rather than a death sentence.  But our detailed map of human DNA has not only revolutionised medicine. Unlocking the genetic secret to human beings has lead to incredible advances in crime-solving techniques, as well as troubling developments in biological weapons and our ability to design future children. Happy 15th birthday to the human genome sequence – here’s how humanity’s DNA is being used.  Crime  Genes determine our facial features, which means that scientists can build a 3D model of a face based on that person’s DNA. “There are certain genes that influence the shape of the lips, others that create an upturned nose or hooked nose, or where your eyes are positioned,” says Dr Peter Claes, medical imaging specialist at the University of Leuven, who has been working on DNA-based facial reconstruction for eight years.  The results have become increasingly accurate at an exponential rate – two years ago, Dr Claes was modeling faces based on those 20 genes. In December he was using 200 genes, and today he’s using 1,200. Dr Claes works by extracting DNA from saliva and building a “base face” based on the person’s gender and geographic background, e.g. a European male. He then applies the varying effects of a thousand more genes to build a 3D image of that individual’s face. The results are close to perfect.    Photo copyright: Peter Claes  “It will never be perfect,” says Dr Claes, “The environment also has an influence. If you’re in a bar fight and slapped in the face and your nose is broken then we’ll never be able to predict the shape of your nose.”  But it means that, if police find sufficient DNA at a crime scene, Dr Claes will be able to build a model of the culprit. His work has recently become even more advanced, as he’s working to identify a person’s photograph based on a sample of their DNA. Dr Claes says the results of his research are “close to fascinating”. It will take a few more years to make the science practical for police forces, but it essentially means that police will be able to scan through a database of drivers’ licenses and identify the wanted criminal based on their DNA.   Picture credit: Peter Claes  Build-a-baby  If you’ve always dreamed of a baby with green eyes and curly brown hair, then the link between our DNA and appearance could make designer babies a disconcerting reality. Dr Claes says he’s received emails from fertility clinics who want to use his technology to help future parents build their perfect baby.   “With in vitro fertilization, you can select the mother’s cells and the father’s cells, which means you could select the face you want,” says Dr Claes. “And if someone’s pregnant, then you can extract the DNA from your future child and predict the face. Then I’m asking myself, ‘If you don’t like this prediction, what are you going to do?’”  If a couple are planning on having a baby, then Dr Claes’ technology could generate the 1,000 possible outcomes that both parents’ genes could create in their children. But you could also manipulate the genetics, to effectively design a child. “With genetic engineering you can create a genetic profile that will generate a certain outcome,” says Dr Claes. “You can say, “I want to have this type of child’ and generate the DNA with that profile. You can start designing your babies, which sounds like science fiction.”   Biological weapons  The science that allows us to create DNA-based personalised medicine can also be used for a far more sinister flipside: biological weapons. Battles have been fought using biological toxins or viruses for hundreds of years –for example, the British distributed smallpox-infected blankets to native tribes in North America. But advances in DNA mean that biological weapons are becoming far more accessible and harmful.  DNA sequencing is now relatively cheap (the cost has dropped from hundreds of millions of pounds to around £600), which means that it’s possible to create harmful viruses in a lab, rather than collecting them from the natural environment (which is a risky and imprecise procedure). Meanwhile, the science behind targeted delivery of drugs could also be used to effectively aim weapons at particular individuals. And, just as medicine can now be adapted according to a patient’s DNA, it’s theoretically possible to create a weapon that would be particularly lethal to certain individuals. “The job of targeting a cancer cell is much more specific than targeting individuals,” says genetics and microbiology expert Andrew Hessel. “No one’s made that type of weapon yet but as we get better at targeted killing for cancer, the switches, tools and molecular components could be applied in that way.”   The sci-fi horror scenario is that a terrorist group could infect an entire nation’s water supply but only harm one person (namely, the prime minister). While this threat is far from being feasible or imminent, we shouldn’t dismiss all advances in biological weapons as distant possibilities.  “Science fiction tends to have a glimpse of the reality to come,” says Professor Paul Cornish, research group director for Defence, Security & Infrastructure at RAND Europe. “How many times have you and I heard, ‘A few years ago, this was science fiction’. We’re at a cautious point here. We can’t panic, but neither can we be complacent.”  Biological weapons are far easier to acquire than nuclear weapons and, in a paper assessing the threat of terrorist weapons in the United Kingdom, Professor Cornish writes that, “many argue that bio-weapons are becoming the terrorist’s ‘weapon of choice’”.  Al Quaeda has said that it intends to use biological weapons and, while the Biological Weapons Convention attempts to monitor and prohibit state use of biological weapons, it would be far more difficult to monitor terrorist groups. “The point to watch for is when access to that level of sophistication and materials is possible for non-state actors,” says Professor Cornish. “This is everybody’s big fear. When does Al Quaeda get to have the money and labs that, let’s say, North Korea have?”  There’s also an extremely blurred line between offensive and defensive work. Dr Kai Ilchamn, research fellow at Sussex University, says it’s worrying to see what western countries research in the name of defence – “If it took place in Iraq, there would be uproar over the legality,” he says. “If this is done in semi-transparent countries, who knows what’s done in secret, and what’s going on in Russia and China. It’s a complete black box.”  Age-reversal  It’s unlikely that Benjamin Button syndrome – the ability to reverse the effects of aging – will remain a fiction in the coming decades.  “In industrialised nations, about 90% of deaths can be ascribed to diseases that are very rare before the age of 50,” says George Church, genetics professor at Harvard Medical School and founder of Personal Genome Project. “They’re classed as diseases of aging.”  Genomics research is at the early stage of reversing the degenerative trends that affect humans’ immune system, nervous system and organs as we age.   “We have demonstrations in animal models and there have been pre-clinical trials, but it hasn’t been done yet in humans yet,” says Professor Church. But it takes only a couple of years for a product to progress from an animal model to research on humans. “Some of the next-gen sequencing is improving at an exponential rate of close to tenfold per year. We could see aging-reversal within a couple of years,” says Professor Church.  Personal DNA data  In an age of social media and open data, we’re comfortable sharing highly personal information online—and our own DNA code is no exception. The Personal Genome Project is aiming to sequence and openly publish the genomes of 100,000 volunteers.  Professor Stephan Beck, professor of medical genomics at UCL and director of the UK contribution to the Personal Genome Project, says that the DNA data is accessible to anyone, which will facilitate research. The number of people who look at Personal Genome Project DNA samples is 500,000 times greater than the number who access more restricted medical studies.   But there are also considerable risks to this openness. For example, private companies have access to the information and could use it to market certain products. Professor Beck acknowledges this possibility, and says that those who take part have to pass a test to show that they understand the possible dangers. “We can demonstrate that the people participating have not been sweet-talked into the research and simply signed a form,” he says.  Though the DNA data will undoubtedly be used by pharmaceutical companies and clinical laboratories, many private companies are also keen to be involved in a business that’s predicted to be worth $1bn (£630m) a year by 2018. Amazon and Google are competing to store genomics data in their cloud computing models, while Apple is working with scientists to collect DNA samples. Smartphone apps will encourage iPhone owners to submit DNA samples to researchers and genetic results could appear directly on consumers’ iPhones.   Dr Helen Wallace, director at GeneWatch UK, says there is a risk of commercial exploitation. “Many companies want to calculate your health risks from your medical records and DNA and use this information for personalised marketing of medicines, foods, supplements and skin creams,” she says. Governments could also use the data to track citizens. “In the future, the government and commercial companies may be able to identify you and your family and again access to your health education, social care and tax records through your DNA,” says Dr Wallace.  Our understanding of the human genome is accelerating at a dramatic rate, and the science will certainly bring both progress and concerns. But whether we fear or welcome the genetic developments, DNA-based discoveries are fast making science fiction a reality. "
telegraph,16/11/2007 18:30,news,"The scientist who created Dolly the sheep, a breakthrough that provoked headlines around the world a decade ago, is to abandon the cloning technique he pioneered to create her.                                                      The life and death of Dolly the diva, by Ian Wilmut                                                                         Ian Wilmut: The status of the human embryo                                                                        Have you say: Can cloning ever be ethical?                                              Prof Ian Wilmut's decision to turn his back on 'therapeutic cloning', just days after US researchers announced a breakthrough in the cloning of primates, will send shockwaves through the scientific establishment.           He and his team made headlines around the world in 1997 when they unveiled Dolly, born July of the year before.             But now he has decided not to pursue a licence to clone human embryos, which he was awarded just two years ago, as part of a drive to find new treatments for the devastating degenerative condition, Motor Neuron disease.             Prof Wilmut, who works at Edinburgh University, believes a rival method pioneered in Japan has better potential for making human embryonic cells which can be used to grow a patient's own cells and tissues for a vast range of treatments, from treating strokes to heart attacks and Parkinson's, and will be less controversial than the Dolly method, known as 'nuclear transfer.'          His announcement could mark the beginning of the end for therapeutic cloning, on which tens of millions of pounds have been spent worldwide over the past decade. 'I decided a few weeks ago not to pursue nuclear transfer,' Prof Wilmut said.         Most of his motivation is practical but he admits the Japanese approach is also 'easier to accept socially.'          His inspiration comes from the research by Prof Shinya Yamanaka at Kyoto University, which suggests a way to create human embryo stem cells without the need for human eggs, which are in extremely short supply, and without the need to create and destroy human cloned embryos, which is bitterly opposed by the pro life movement.          Prof Yamanaka has shown in mice how to turn skin cells into what look like versatile stem cells potentially capable of overcoming the effects of disease.         This pioneering work to revert adult cells to an embryonic state has been reproduced by a team in America and Prof Yamanaka is, according to one British stem cell scientist, thought to have achieved the same feat in human cells.         This work has profound significance because it suggests that after a heart attack, for example, skin cells from a patient might one day be manipulated by adding a cocktail of small molecules to form muscle cells to repair damage to the heart, or brain cells to repair the effects of Parkinson's. Because they are the patient's own cells, they would not be rejected.          In theory, these reprogrammed cells could be converted into any of the 200 other type in the body, even the collections of different cell types that make up tissues and, in the very long term, organs too. Prof Wilmut said it was 'extremely exciting and astonishing' and that he now plans to do research in this area.          This approach, he says, represents, the future for stem cell research, rather than the nuclear transfer method that his large team used more than a decade ago at the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, to create Dolly.         In this method, the DNA contents of an adult cell are put into an emptied egg and stimulated with a shock of electricity to develop into a cloned embryo, which must be then dismantled to yield the flexible stem cells.         More than a decade ago, biologists though the mechanisms that picked the relevant DNA code that made a cell adopt the identity of skin, rather than muscle, brain or whatever, were so complex and so rigidly fixed that it would not be possible to undo them.         They were amazed when this deeply-held conviction was overturned by Dolly, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell, a feat with numerous practical applications, most remarkably in stem cell science.          But although 'therapeutic cloning' offers a way to get a patient's own embryonic stem cells to generate unlimited supplies of cells and tissue there is an intense search for alternatives because of pressure from the pro-life lobby, the opposition of President George W Bush and ever present concerns about cloning babies.          Prof Wilmut's decision signals the lack of progress in extending his team's pioneering work on Dolly to humans.         The hurdles seem to have been overcome a few years ago by a team led by Prof Hwang Woo-Suk in South Korea, with whom he set up a collaboration.         Then it was discovered Prof Hwang's work was fraudulent. 'We spent a long time talking to him before discovering it was all a fraud,' he said. 'I never really got started again after that.'          And Prof Wilmut believes there is still a long way to go for therapeutic cloning to work, despite the headlines greeting this week's announcement in Nature by Dr Shoukhrat Mitalipov and colleagues at Oregon Health & Science University, Beaverton, that they cloned primate embryos.          In all Dr Mitalipov used 304 eggs from 14 rhesus monkeys to make two lines of embryonic stem cells, one of which was chromosomally abnormal. Dr Mitalipov himself admits the efficiency is low and, though his work is a 'proof of principle' and the efficiency of his methods has improved, he admits it is not yet a cost effective medical option.          Cloning is still too wasteful of precious human eggs, which are in great demand for fertility treatments, to consider for creating embryonic stem cells. 'It is a nice success but a bit limited,' commented Prof Wilmut. 'Given the low efficiency, you wonder just how long nuclear transfer will have a useful life.'          Nor is it clear, he said, why the Oregon team was successful, which will hamper attempts to improve their methods. Instead, Prof Wilmut is backing direct reprogramming or 'de-differentiation', the embryo free route pursued by Prof Yamanaka, which he finds '100 times more interesting.'          'The odds are that by the time we make nuclear transfer work in humans, direct reprogramming will work too.         I am anticipating that before too long we will be able to use the Yamanaka approach to achieve the same, without making human embryos. I have no doubt that in the long term, direct reprogramming will be more productive, though we can't be sure exactly when, next year or five years into the future.'          Prof Yamanaka's work suggests the dream of converting adult cells into those that can grow into many different types can be realised remarkably easily.         When his team used a virus to add four genes (called Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4) into adult mouse fibroblast cells they found they could find resulting embryo-like cells by sifting the result for the one in 10,000 cells that make proteins Nanog or Oct4, both typical markers of embryonic cells.          When they studied how genes are used in these reprogrammed cells, 'called induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells', they were typical of the activity seen in an embryo. In the test tube, the new cells look and grow like embryonic stem cells.         And they were also able to generate viable chimaeras from the cells, where the embryo cells created by the new method could be mixed with those of a mouse embryo to grow into a viable adult which could pass on the DNA of the reprogrammed cells to the next generation.          None the less, there will have to be much work to establish that they behave like embryo cells, let alone see if they are safe enough to use in the body. Even so, in the short term they will offer an invaluable way to create lines of cells from people with serious diseases, such as motor neuron disease, to shed light on the mechanisms.          Given the history of fraud in this field, the Oregon research was verified by Dr David Cram and colleagues at Monash University, Melbourne. 'At this stage, nuclear transfer to create pluripotent stem cell lines remains an inefficient process,' said Dr Cram.         'De-differentiation may indeed prove to be more efficient method but there is still much research to do to optimise nuclear transfer and de-differentiation and demonstrate genetic normality after these manipulations.'          Prof Robin Lovell-Badge of the National Institute of Medical Research, Mill Hill, said the overall success rate of 0.7 per cent reported by the team Oregon 'is still too low to be used in human studies, especially given the difficulty in obtaining eggs for research.         'I do think de-differentiation is very likely to be the future - once this has been shown to work in humans (I hear rumours that it is) and to work well with a reliable cell source (that is, without too many mutations, and so on)'.          Britain's new Nobel prize winner and pioneer of stem cell research, Sir Martin Evans of the Cardiff School of Biosciences, commented on the Japanese work: 'This will be the long-term solution.'         The news that Prof Wilmut is to abandon cloning was welcomed by Josephine Quintavalle on behalf of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, which is against  the use of human embryos in research.         'At last scientists are starting to see reason and we are going to have fact and reality, rather than hype. It could not come at a better time with the new Human Tissue and Embryos Bill having its second reading in the Lords on Monday. It is a gift to us all. We are at last going to see some common sense coming into the debate.'         She added this work could mark the end of proposals to create animal human hybrid embryos too, to overcome difficulties obtaining enough human eggs, since this now seems irrelevant.          'If people are doubting the straight cloning process, what on earth are they are going to say about combining two different species.'         She is aware of the Japanese work and said it was given a cautious welcome  at a recent meeting in the Vatican.         'A lot of people who have looked at it with more scientific expertise than me said it is very convincing and very interesting.'         She added that this approach would attract more investment because it is not burdened with the ethical issues of creating and destroying embryos.         Quintavalle said that the Oregon work was much more disappointing than suggested by newspaper headlines.         'We read that 15,000 monkey eggs were used in order to develop the new protocol; that the current application of this protocol required 304 eggs to derive 2 embryonic stem cell lines, one of which was chromosomally abnormal, delivering an extremely low success rate of 0.7 per cent.         'The researchers acknowledge that they have little idea of what separates the successes from the failures, and whilst it might be theoretically possible to repeat this research in humans it is unlikely that anybody could obtain the number of eggs necessary for such experiments.         'It is also noted that the embryos created were morphologically poor and attempts at pregnancy on 77 occasions were all unsuccessful. Shoukhrat Mitalipov, the lead scientist is quoted as saying, 'No pregnancy made it even to day 25.''"
telegraph,23/10/2010 09:30,news,"The XCell-Centre holds out hope of a treatment for incurable diseases. Alasdair Palmer, who has MS, travelled to Düsseldorf for a consultation.Hope is important to everyone, but it is particularly precious to those who   suffer from an incurable disease. I am one of that group. I was diagnosed   with multiple sclerosis nearly 20 years ago. I now have to use a wheelchair, and the future is not particularly rosy. So   whenever I hear that there has been a new scientific development which could   turn out to be a cure, or which could at least halt the progression of the   disease, I start to hope. I know that, on every occasion in the past, the news of a cure has turned out   to be false: the claims that the new treatment can reverse MS have, on   closer inspection, all turned out to be bogus. But I can't stop myself from hoping that this time it's different: this time   the elixir really has been found. Like everyone else with a neurological disease, my hopes have been, and are,   raised by stem cell research. In theory, there is every chance that eventually, stem cells – the cells which   have the potential to convert themselves into any kind of specialist cell in   the body, from brain and nerve cells to the cells that make up your skin or   your liver – might eventually provide an effective treatment for MS. But progress towards that goal is in practice proving to be agonisingly slow,   not least because everything that has the potential to do good can also do   harm. It requires a great deal of research to show that a therapy isn't going to be   damaging. The history of medicine is littered with treatments that seemed to   be miracle cures, but turned out to be harmful. Even techniques such as heart transplants, which are now routinely practised   and save thousands of lives around the world every year, started by killing   all the patients who had them. None the less, when I was asked by the editor of The Sunday Telegraph   to investigate a medical centre in Düsseldorf that offers stem cell   treatment to those who can afford to pay for it, I was immediately   intrigued. I'm aware that a British doctor has been struck off the medical register in   this country for offering such treatments. I've also written sceptical   articles about the claims made by doctors who say they can provide stem cell 'cures'   for MS. I've also read non-technical summaries of the scientific papers published in   medical journals which point to the difficulties with existing stem cell   techniques, and to the fact that there is as yet no trial which has provided   solid evidence of their benefits. And yet – there is always the possibility that a brilliant medical researcher   has come up with a very effective technique which, while it has not yet been   proved to be effective, actually is. So in spite of my well-rehearsed scepticism, the XCell-Centre in Düsseldorf   got my hopes up. A quick glance at its website demonstrates that its doctors   are very confident that their stem cell treatment is effective in treating   MS and other neurological diseases. My hope focused on a single thought: it is surely not impossible that they   have found something that works. And if it is not impossible – mightn't it   be worth trying? I booked myself a consultation with Professor Doctor Haberland. I was   immediately informed that it would cost 300 euros, and that I would have to   pay before the consultation. The X-Cell Centre is housed in a large hospital building overlooking the   Rhine. As I waited for my appointment, it was clear that everyone else who   was waiting for a consultation suffered from the same hope that I did. Some of them were considerably more desperate for a cure than I am. One woman   with advanced Parkinson's Disease – she had travelled all the way from the   United States – told me quite simply that she knew the treatment wasn't   scientifically proven. She even realised that there was a significant chance it wouldn't work. 'But   what is my alternative?', she asked plaintively. 'For me, there is   none, except waiting until I degenerate to the point where I die, or want to   die.'Our conversation was interrupted because I was called in to my meeting with   Professor Haberland. He is a genial man with an air of intense professional competence: he is a   trained neurosurgeon who has spent most of his career working on injuries to   the spinal cord. He was friendly and patient. He said that his treatment consisted of taking stem cells from the patient's   bone marrow, separating them, and then injecting them. 'We have some amazing results with this treatment,' he told me. He insisted that the best results came from combining this approach with an   operation developed by an Italian doctor named Zamboni, which involved, Prof   Haberland said, widening veins in the patient's neck. Zamboni had, Prof Haberland claimed, established that many neurological   conditions were connected to a narrowing of these veins. When the operation to widen them was used in conjunction with the injection of   stem cells, 'you have a win-win situation … 80 per cent of our patients   report improvements'. He pointed to a Dutch patient who had been in a wheelchair prior to the   operation, but after it, had been able to walk. So if I had the treatment, would I be able to walk? 'You would have a   chance', Prof Haberland replied. 'The response is very different   from patient to patient. But you would have a chance.' And it would   only cost about 19,500 euros. Against my better judgement, I felt my hopes rising. But there were also some   questions. How did Prof Haberland know how successful the treatment was?   What was the follow up? 'We ask patients to fill in a questionnaire   three months after the operation, and we see them here and test them after   six months', he said. There is, however, considerable doubt whether a patient questionnaire has any   value, since it is not an objective measure. There is still more doubt as to how many patients actually bother to travel   all the way to Düsseldorf for an assessment by the centre six months after   the operation. Moreover, Prof Haberland said he had only been doing the double operation –   the combination of stem cells and widening the veins in the patient's neck –   for six months. How, I wondered, could there be any reliable data from such a short period?   Would Prof Haberland be publishing his results? No, he said: he had no plans   to. 'We need more cases and then we need to make a double blind study   in multi centres. This is a long way off.'But if Prof Haberland hasn't enough patients for a proper trial – how can he   be sure even that his operation isn't harmful, let alone that it actually   benefits patients? He was unequivocal that because he uses stem cells from the patient's own   body, injecting those cells can't hurt the patient. It certainly sounds plausible. But no one can know until there has been a   large-scale study. Professor Neil Scolding of Bristol University followed six patients with MS   after they had been injected with stem cells taken from their bone marrow   for over a year. Careful monitoring showed that none of the patients were harmed. But the   evidence of benefit was less certain: rather than any improvement, it   suggested that the patients' condition had stabilised instead of   deteriorating further. It became increasingly obvious in the course of my discussion with Prof   Haberland that he does not have any clear, objective and verifiable evidence   that his treatment provides the sort of benefits that he claims for it. It is not even clear that he and the hospital have followed up their patients   at all. I asked for any records showing objective evidence of how patients   improved after the operation. None have been provided. That was not enough to extinguish my hopes altogether, however, for Prof   Haberland is very persuasive. He is a subtle salesman. He held out the possibility that I would experience   enormous benefits from his operation – but he did not promise them outright.   That leaves just enough room for hope to do its work of eroding doubt. I recorded my interview with Prof Haberland, and showed a transcript to Prof   Scolding, an internationally-recognised neurologist and expert on stem cell   treatments for MS. Prof Scolding noted that Prof Haberland's claims about what bone marrow stem   cells can do are not, in principle, wrong – but he also pointed out that   that is quite different from showing that his treatment can or does make the   symptoms of anyone with MS improve. Prof Scolding was more forthright in his criticism of Prof Haberland's claims   for the 'vein clearing' operation developed by Zamboni. 'There are potentially serious consequences for stenting for this   so-called condition – one patient has died in the US,' Prof   Scolding stated. 'There is emerging published evidence that there is no link between   venous drainage in the neck and MS. 'Applying this 'treatment' to patients with Parkinson's and other   neurological conditions ... is extremely eccentric.'He added: 'If patients had genuinely responded to [Prof Haberland's]   evidence-free combination of stem cell therapy and vein clearing treatment,   it would be scandalous for him not to have published his results. 'To my mind, if they are persuading often-desperate patients to pay large   sums of money for treatments that have no sustainable evidence to support   them, it is cynically exploitative and a disgrace to the practice of   medicine.'That, to me, sums it up perfectly. It extinguished whatever hope Prof   Haberland had kindled in me. "
telegraph,23/04/2008 18:05,news,"Two men have become the first patients in Britain to benefit from a pioneering £1.2 million project aimed at reducing the number of fatalities and suffering caused by heart disease, Britain's leading killer.                                                      First bioartificial heart may signal end of organ shortage                                             For the first time, heart attack patients have had stem cells  injected into their hearts within a critical five hours of an attack to see if these can improve quality of life and delay or prevent the onset of heart failure, a frequently seen complication.         This, the first clinical research project to be supported by the UK Stem Cell Foundation, was designed by Dr Anthony Mathur, senior lecturer and consultant cardiologist, and Prof John Martin, British Heart Foundation chair in cardiovascular sciences; at Barts and the London NHS Trust and University College London respectively.         The men were among the heart attack patients brought to the London Chest Hospital (Barts and the London NHS Trust) and the Heart Hospital, (UCLH Trust) for treatment. In the procedure, a stem cell sample is taken from the patient's own bone marrow. After the stem cells have been prepared, they are injected into the previously blocked artery.         The stem cells were injected in conjunction with angioplasty - where the blocked arteries in heart attack patients are opened as quickly as possible with a balloon.         Prof Martin says: 'Taking heart attack patients to centres where their blocked coronary artery can be opened immediately has lead to significant increases in survival and decreases in the damage to heart muscle. Previous studies in the heart have shown that stem cell delivery to the heart is safe. We will show whether it works in acute heart attack. Our study combines the two new ways of treating heart attack victims for the first time.'         Although announced two years ago, the enormous bureaucracy involved in gaining approval meant the first two patients have only been treated in the past few days. Prof Martin says that the identity of the patients must stay secret.         Prof Martin, chairman of a European stem cell task force, hopes that the results of the trial on 100 patients will be known in 18 months. Then it will be possible to judge if this can help address one of the biggest killers in the UK - 108,000 people die every year from heart attack.         The trial is blinded and randomised, meaning that some randomly selected patients will receive an injection of harmless salt water for comparison, to help end controversy over whether these injections work.         There has been argument over how the stem cell transplants work, whether they seed the growth of new muscle, new blood vessels or whether simply injecting the heart provokes it to exude factors or hormones that aid self repair         Carefully designed trials are crucial according to a study of earlier trials of bone marrow, published in the Lancet by Prof Harald Arnesen and colleagues from the Ullevål University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, which concluded that trials to date since a pioneering one at Johann Wolfgang Goethe Hospital in Frankfurt 'are not convincing'. Prof Arnesen has discussed his findings with Prof Martin.         Another British trial is planned by Mr Raimondo Ascione of the Bristol Heart Institute, University of Bristol. 'We are very close,' says Mr Ascione, adding that his bone marrow cell trial on 60 patients will start in May or June.         He emphasises, like Prof Martin that there is much bureaucracy to deal with because the method - which requires open heart surgery in his case - is so new.         In another project, at a much earlier stage, three kinds of human heart cells have been grown in the laboratory, marking another advance in the use of stem cells to repair damaged hearts.         Embryonic stem cells are master stem cells that in principal can generate the 200 or more cells types found in the body.         In this study, the Canadian led research team has turned human embryonic stem cells into three of the major cell types in the heart, marking another step towards the test-tube creation of functioning heart tissue for possible future transplantation for the treatment of heart disease.         This work, reported in Nature by Prof Gordon Keller of the McEwen Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Toronto, offers 'approaches for the efficient and reproducible generation of human heart cells,' he says.         The team created the cells by supplying embryonic stem cells growing in the lab with a cocktail of growth factors and other molecules involved in development, carefully following the progression of the embryonic cells to heart cells.         By supplying the right growth factors at the right time during development, they encouraged the cells to grow into a single 'progenitor' of three different types of heart cells, called cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells - each an important constituent of functioning heart muscle.         This will help researchers to understand heart development in more detail. What's more, when the team transplanted a mixture of the three cell types into mice with simulated heart disease, their heart function was significantly improved, offering hope to those aiming to develop this technique for treating human hearts.         However, he says that tests in larger animals, such as pigs and sheep, would be necessary before considering testing them on patients. 'If I gave you a timeline, it would almost certainly be inaccurate. We may underestimate or run into hurdles,' he tells the Telegraph.         He adds that they will prove useful for screening heart drugs and could complement a method developed in Minnesota to grow a replacement heart, in which a dead heart is stripped of cells to leave chambers, valves and the blood vessel structure intact, then repopulate the structure with a patient's own cells.         As for the use of bone marrow cells to treat heart patients, he said that initial hopes that they could turn into a wide variety of types has not been borne out but 'they probably could contribute to the blood vessels. That could help the heart to function.'         Coronary heart disease kills more women than breast cancer in the United Kingdom. Despite deaths from heart attacks decreasing, it is still the biggest killer in the UK. Every two minutes someone has a heart attack. A third of those patients die before they reach hospital."
telegraph,22/06/2000 00:00,news,"        Roger Highfield says that with the first draft of the human genome, the real work starts: using it to fight genetic disease  WITHIN a few days, a milestone in medicine will be passed when rival teams unveil the first drafts of the genetic recipe of a person: the human genome.                               Genetic sleuth: Professor Kay Davies of Oxford University and Lord Attenborough are hopeful of finding effective treatments for muscular dystrophy          There will be much champagne and ballyhoo. There will be much bickering over whether the American private effort 'beat' the international publicly-backed consortium. Column inches will be devoted to the race and what the 'book of mankind' means.No one doubts that the project will change medicine and, in turn, society. But the draft is only the beginning: it takes time to turn knowledge into action. Vesalius dissected the heart in 1543 to reveal its secrets. Patients had to wait another four centuries for the first heart transplant.Scientists are rolling up their sleeves to study the three billion 'letters' of code and determine how its 'words' - genes - describe proteins within every cell, where they act as catalysts, structural elements, signalling messengers, even molecular machines that squeeze muscles.Next month, in Oxford, Lord Attenborough will open one of the first centres of excellence dedicated to the mammoth task of making sense of how genes spell out Homo sapiens.The Medical Research Council's Functional Genetics Unit will be led by Prof Kay Davies. After 15 years at the forefront of molecular genetics, she is now rising to the 'post-genomic challenge'.Her team will compile, sift and collate the avalanche of genome data to find treatments for the 4,000 or so hereditary diseases caused by gene defects and to identify the myriad genetic variations that act with diet, lifestyle and other environmental factors to influence our predisposition to cancer, heart disease and mental illness.'We will use genomics - working with whole DNA sequences; proteomics - studying the proteins made from gene sequences; molecular physiology - how cells work; and structural studies - looking at the structure of proteins, to ask specific questions about gene function,' she said. 'This integrated approach is essential if full advantage is to be gained from the human genome programmes.'First, scientists need to identify the patches in the genome - about three per cent - that actually correspond to genes. As one sign of how primitive current understanding is, researchers worldwide have recently been placing bets on the overall number, with estimates varying from 30,000 to 140,000 genes.Then synchrotrons, powerful sources of X-rays, can reveal the shapes of proteins, which determines how they work. For this kind of work, a £200 million synchrotron, called Diamond, will be built near Didcot, Oxfordshire.Gene function can be deduced by studying the genomes of other creatures, such as fruit flies, yeast and worms, because they use the same proteins to do important jobs. By knocking out a gene in a fly, scientists can study its function. Once it is understood this way, computers can then scour the human genome for similar genes.Most difficult of all, scientists will study how proteins interact within a living cell. They will scan for shifts in cellular chemistry caused when a gene clicks into action, revealing other genes in its thrall. And they will rummage through genomes for a 'Rosetta Stone' code, where the genes for different proteins in other organisms have been joined, suggesting these proteins probably work together in a metabolic chain.Prof Davies and Lord Attenborough share a deep interest in one particular hereditary disease: muscular dystrophy. The main form (there are 20 different types) strikes when there is a spelling mistake in a gene responsible for a protein called dystrophin, which joins the inside of muscle fibres to the outside. The result is Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.Boys are at risk because the dystrophin gene is located on the X chromosome, of which women have a pair, and men only one. It is extremely rare for women to inherit a faulty dystrophin gene on both of their X chromosomes, but they can tolerate a single faulty gene, which can then be passed to a son to cause the disease in about one in 3,000 boys. When defective dystrophin is made, muscles waste away. Four decades ago, Lord Attenborough was horrified by the effects when he visited St Mary's Hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, and met wheelchair-bound teenagers condemned to a short life. Later that day, when he saw his son Michael playing football, he decided to become involved with the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, of which he has been president for the past 30 years.He is enthusiastic about the new unit. 'It is at the cutting edge of genetic science and I am so looking forward to seeing the results of the research conducted here, which are undoubtedly going to have a real impact.'Understanding has come a long way since 1986, when the dystrophin gene was identified by Prof Louis Kunkel's team at the Children's Hospital in Boston Massachusetts. Even then, scientists realised that treatment would be tricky: at two million letters, the dystrophin gene is one of the largest of all known genes, so transplanting dystrophin into all affected muscle cells, including those in the heart, would be problematic. And, given that the body of the sufferer has never encountered the protein, there was a risk of rejection.In 1989, Prof Davies found a similar muscle protein, called utrophin, which offered an alternative. About the same size as dystrophin, utrophin is made in the foetus until about 23 weeks' gestation, when dystrophin is made instead and utrophin used only for more specialist tasks in nerve cells.The fact that the body always 'sees' utrophin meant that rejection would not be a problem. Then an experiment carried out in 1992 by Prof Davies's team proved encouraging: it was possible to cure a mouse with muscular dystrophy by injecting the genetic code for utrophin into an early embryo to create a GM mouse, something that would be unethical in humans but at least showed a cure is feasible.She then investigated how to get the gene into an affected baby. Utrophin, like dystrophin, is too big to introduce with a virus (the standard 'vector' for gene transplants). Prof Davies condensed it by exploiting how only a fraction of the gene contains actual code for the protein (the remainder - called introns - is 'junk'). By junking the junk, she made a mini utrophin gene that could be squeezed into a virus.Gene therapy on a new-born mouse with muscular dystrophy fixed the problem, but only in muscles injected with the virus. This success came when an alternative approach, the implant of immature muscle cells - myoblasts - had faltered. But there was still the problem of how to make utrophin in all muscles.Now, however, an alternative has emerged. Prof Davies has found two 'promoters' - switches to turn on the manufacture of utrophin. These could be targeted by drugs to reactivate utrophin production throughout the body. 'We are optimistic this approach will work if we can find a drug to do it,' she said.Her new unit will help boost the rate at which this knowledge is turned into treatments. One major theme will be the study of gene networks involved in nerve-muscle and nerve-nerve interactions, shedding light not only on muscular dystrophy but also on diseases such as Parkinson's, muscular atrophy and stroke.With luck, Prof Davies may find an efficient way to fix the damage caused throughout the body by a faulty dystrophin protein. Four decades after Lord Attenborough visited St Mary's, the first effective treatments look a real possibility."
telegraph,26/05/2004 00:01,news,"             Roger Highfield reports on the debate  surrounding access to the first stem cell bank                    When the world's first bank of human stem cells opened last week, it became clear that the pioneering British effort is striving for ethical as well as scientific excellence.          Prof Colin Blakemore, chief executive of the Medical Research Council, voiced concerns that it may not be able to bank stem cells derived in South Korea from the first human cloned embryos because they have a clouded provenance.          Prof Blakemore was speaking at the opening of the bank at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, South Mimms, which will store adult, foetal and embryonic stem cells. Of these, stem cells from early embryos have the most potential to turn into any of the 200 different types in the body, offering huge opportunities to repair a patient. And cloned embryos offer the opportunity to grow a patient's own cells.          Earlier this year, Prof Woo Suk Hwang's team at Seoul National University created 30 cloned embryos using tissue and eggs donated by women and grew them in a laboratory for up to six days. From the embryos they produced one stem cell line, a potentially unlimited supply of spare-part tissue for one of the women.          Prof Blakemore said there was concern that a researcher donated her own eggs for cloning. 'That is generally considered by ethicists not to be a situation in which you can give proper consent because it is for your own benefit. If a woman researcher donated the eggs, then clearly the gain for her was getting her name on a science paper.''          There are other issues. One is 'to what extent informed consent was given by the women who donated the eggs. There are no accusations being made, but if the recording of consent does not match the rigorous requirements for the bank, they would never get in.''          Applications to deposit stem cells go to the bank's steering committee, chaired by Lord Patel, who said at the launch that the bank must be 'ethically sourced'. In response to these concerns, Prof Hwang told The  Telegraph that no one from his team donated eggs. And he stressed that his colleagues followed guidelines.          A Newcastle University team, which is the first to apply to clone human embryos in Britain, hopes to deposit its own line of cloned embryonic stem cells within a few years as part of an effort to develop new treatments for diabetes. Dr Miodrag Stojkovic, head of the project, has already cloned cows, rabbits and mice, and came to Britain from the University of Munich in 2002 - one of several stem cell researchers who came here to take advantage of favourable regulatory and funding conditions.          He plans to use the 'nuclear transfer' cloning procedure used to create Dolly, in which all the genetic material will be moved from diabetic and normal skin cells into a human egg whose DNA has been removed. After the transfer, the reprogrammed egg will be stimulated to start dividing. From the resulting ball of 100 or so cells, the stem cells will be extracted and cultured for research, nurtured by human fibroblast cells to ensure that they can be used for treatments.          The project will use some of the 2,000 eggs left from fertility treatment annually at the Newcastle Fertility Centre at Life with consent from the donors. If it gets approval from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, donors could be approached for approval within weeks. Dr Stojkovic's team could produce Britain's first cloned embryo by the end of the year.          He said that one purpose of the new project was to improve the overall efficiency of cloning, pointing out how the Koreans used 242 human eggs to derive one stem cell line. The other aim is to compare diabetic cells with normal cells to shed light on the mechanisms of disease.          Prof Alison Murdoch, director of the centre, said she hopes that eventually a diabetic's own tissue could be grown for transplant. 'Imagine there is a 10-year-old child with diabetes in Newcastle today. We hope that, in a decade, we could take a skin cell, reprogramme it, make safe islet cells (which make insulin) and put them back into that boy so he never needs an insulin injection again.''          The application has already been passed by the local ethical committee and Newcastle expects a decision from the HFEA this summer. 'We are ready to go.''"

The team reported yesterday that it is the first to use gene transplants in the womb to cure an inherited disease - the blood clotting disorder Haemophilia B.          Success in using a 'tamed' Human Immunodeficiency Virus to implant corrective genes to cure foetal mice was reported to the British Society for Gene Therapy in Keble College, Oxford, by Dr Simon Waddington and colleagues from Imperial College London.          Consultations on conducting transplants on unborn children are about to start, along with discussions with the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee, which supervises human trials.          Gene therapy in the womb has been studied for a decade by Imperial's Gene Therapy Research Group, headed by Prof Charles Coutelle. This first application was funded by the Medical Research Council and a charity, the Katharine Dormandy Trust for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders.          The approach was advancing to where it could be considered on patients in special circumstances, said Dr Waddington, notably when a hereditary disorder was diagnosed during pregnancy and the parents, for religious or personal reasons, refused a termination even though the baby might die soon after birth.          The group has joined with Prof Charles Rodeck at University College and the Royal Free Hospital, London, to explore the safe use of gene therapy on a human foetus. Dr Michael Themis of Imperial is assessing the safety of the adapted Human Immunodeficiency Virus used for the transplants.          The team will also consult doctors and patient groups to explore ethical dimensions. The advance is likely to stir debate since a method to correct diseases could also be used to create 'designer' babies.          These investigations were likely to take several years, said Prof Coutelle. If shown to be efficient and safe in larger animals, such as sheep, an injection of virus-derived medicine offers the promise of a cure for diseases such as enzyme deficiencies, perhaps even muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis.          There are reasons to think gene transplants will be more successful in the foetus than in children or adults, among them the better access to cells that need to be corrected before the disease develops, and fewer immune reactions.          Inefficient gene transplants have caused problems, along with immune reactions.          Despite huge promise, human trials have only worked convincingly after birth in treating immune deficiencies, when so-called 'bubble babies' are stripped of the ability to fight infection.          Other issues are raised by foetal gene therapy, notably whether transplanted genes can end up in eggs and sperm. However, a screen of the sperm made by mice in the Imperial experiments did not reveal genes transferred this way.          Prof Edward Tuddenham, of Imperial, who is working on adult gene therapy for haemophilia, said there was often knee-jerk opposition to foetal gene therapy.          Half a dozen trials have been conducted in America on patients. These trials implanted either factor VIII or factor IX genes, but only at levels that would reduce dependence on treatment.          One trial detected the virus used for the transplant in semen, raising concerns about germ-line transformations. All but two are discontinued.          As more patients use more expensive biotechnology-manufactured clotting factors, lifetime treatment costs may rise to £5 million.          'No wonder most of the world's haemophiliacs receive no treatment at all,' said Prof Tuddenham. 'Gene therapy offers the hope of freeing patients from a lifetime's dependence on the needle.'                      Gene therapy research is to be given a £4 million injection, the Health Secretary, John Reid, said yesterday.Around £1 million will be spent on safety studies, including of the viruses used for gene transplants, such as HIV. Another £500,000 will be given to Dr Kyriacos Mitrophanous of Oxford BioMedica for research on Haemophilia A, caused by a lack of factor VIII, marking the first British gene therapy haemophilia trial.                The Muscular Dystrophy Campaign is awarded £1.6 million for research into the fatal muscle-wasting condition.                Headed by Prof Francesco Muntoni of Imperial, the research aims is to insert a 'molecular patch' to fix the underlying genetic error in a trial that will also mark a British first.                Another £900,000 is awarded to Dr Robin Ali of University College London to treat childhood blindness.                      "

Half a dozen trials have been conducted in America on patients. These trials implanted either factor VIII or factor IX genes, but only at levels that would reduce dependence on treatment.          One trial detected the virus used for the transplant in semen, raising concerns about germ-line transformations. All but two are discontinued.          As more patients use more expensive biotechnology-manufactured clotting factors, lifetime treatment costs may rise to £5 million.          'No wonder most of the world's haemophiliacs receive no treatment at all,' said Prof Tuddenham. 'Gene therapy offers the hope of freeing patients from a lifetime's dependence on the needle.'                      • Gene therapy research is to be given a £4 million injection, the Health Secretary, John Reid, said yesterday.          Around £1 million will be spent on safety studies, including of the viruses used for gene transplants, such as HIV. Another £500,000 will be given to Dr Kyriacos Mitrophanous of Oxford BioMedica for research on Haemophilia A, caused by a lack of factor VIII, marking the first British gene therapy haemophilia trial.          The Muscular Dystrophy Campaign is awarded £1.6 million for research into the fatal muscle-wasting condition.          Headed by Prof Francesco Muntoni of Imperial, the research aims is to insert a 'molecular patch' to fix the underlying genetic error in a trial that will also mark a British first.          Another £900,000 is awarded to Dr Robin Ali of University College London to treat childhood blindness."
telegraph,19/01/2005 00:00,technology,"            Dismantling human embryos for cell therapy has prompted a clash of strong views. But what are the alternatives? Roger Highfield reports                  The debate about whether to dismantle human embryos for their stem cells has seen a clash of strongly held views. On one side are scientists and patients who believe this is a small price to pay for creating treatments for a vast range of awful diseases. On the other lies the pro-life lobby, which argues that this means the commodification and sacrifice of human life.          Stem cells – parent cells of the 200 or so types in the body – could be used to generate unlimited supplies of cells and tissues, even organs in the distant future, to repair an ailing body. But while some scientists want to use cells from tiny week-old cloned embryos to avoid problems of rejection, the pro-life lobby has called for alternatives, seizing on the claims of other researchers that adult stem cells in the body of a patient maintain sufficient flexibility to do the job of repair.          More radical ways to obtain these extraordinarily versatile cells are under study. Several embryo-free methods, the 'Holy Grail of stem-cell research', were highlighted at a recent meeting of the President's Council on Bioethics in the United States, where the status of the early embryo has been the subject of a feud between the pragmatists of science and industry and the fundamentalists of the Christian right.          One approach is already being tested at the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh. Dr Paul De Sousa and Professor Ian Wilmut are using parthenogenesis, meaning 'virgin birth', to obtain stem cells. In parthenogenesis, it is possible to use a shock of electricity or chemicals to mimic the way that a sperm makes an egg divide. The result of doing this to an egg is a parthenogenetic embryo – a parthenote – that retains the full set of DNA of the egg donor and the capacity to give rise to stem cells with adult potential, but which cannot form a viable conceptus. These stem cells could be used to treat the woman who donated the egg.           Not everyone is convinced. Prof José Cibelli of Michigan State University in East Lansing told the journal Science he is concerned that cells from the parthenotes could be seen as foreign tissue: during the lengthy process of egg development – meiosis – the genes of a woman's mother and father are scrambled by a process called recombination, so her eggs have a different genetic make-up. Using embryonic cells that he has isolated from a monkey parthenote, Prof Cibelli is about to test whether stem cells from parthenotes could end up being rejected as easily as foreign issue.          Regardless of the sex of the recipient, parthenote cells could also be used to treat Parkinson's, for example, because an exact tissue match is probably not required for tissues in the 'immune-privileged' brain.          At the Council on Bioethics, scientists discussed another option: to sabotage the 'nuclear-transfer' process developed by Prof Wilmut and others to clone an adult, where the DNA-containing nucleus of a patient's cell is transferred into an egg and, after a jolt of electricity, persuaded to divide. In Prof Cibelli's proposal, a key developmental gene would be disrupted before the nucleus is transferred, so that it still makes embryonic cells but they could never develop into a viable embryo.          He  for a patent on just such a technique in 2002, when he still worked for the cloning company ACT in Worcester, Massachusetts. A variant of this method, in which a spanner is thrown into the works of a cell (in fact a strand of the genetic material RNA), has been proposed by developmental biologist Prof Hans Schöler of the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Münster, Germany. 'By combining both methods, we could have a powerful way to do this,' said Prof Cibelli.          But some have their doubts. If this approach allows several days of relatively normal development, then it would not solve the problem, according to Richard Doerflinger of the National Council of Catholic Bishops in Washington, DC. 'A short-lived embryo is still an embryo,' he told Science.          Scientists too are unhappy that the ethical tail is wagging the science dog. Dr Robert Lanza of ACT remarked that it will be 'a sad day when we have to use cloning and genetic manipulation to deliberately create crippled human embryos – and not for any scientific reason, but simply to appease religious leaders. I sometimes have to pinch myself to make sure we're not still in the 12th century'.          Perhaps the most promising approach is to devise clone-free methods that can wind back the developmental clock of a patient's cell so that it can recover the full potential of an embyronic stem cell. After a heart attack, skin cells from a patient might be turned into muscle cells to repair damage to the heart.           The aim is to understand what it is about the cloning process (nuclear transfer) that enables an adult cell to be returned to an embryonic state, then mimic those events to change cells from one type to another. There are hints that this might be possible. In February 2001, the Roslin-based biotech company PPL announced at a meeting of the British Fertility Society that it had turned skin cells into stem cells, then into heart cells. For commercial reasons, details were not disclosed.          One year later, Prof Philippe Collas of the Institute of Medical Biochemistry, University of Oslo, reported how he converted one body cell –fibroblasts – so they formed another type, white blood cells called T cells. His team made holes in the cell membranes of the fibroblasts and dunked them into an extract from the T cells. This 'reprogrammed' the fibroblasts to act like T cells. Since then, he has converted fibroblasts into insulin-producing cells, albeit transiently, and fat cells into cardiomyocytes of heart muscle.           Another approach has been taken by Profs Peter Schultz and Sheng Ding at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, who have been screening molecules in a hunt for those that can turn the clock forward or back in a cell's development. The chemists are on the trail of a small molecule they call 'reversine' that can cause a muscle cell to turn into a progenitor cell that has more developmental potential and could be turned into a wider repertoire of tissue types.          Ultimately, scientists want to use these methods to persuade body cells to 'dedifferentiate' – make the journey back to earlier, more plastic stages. Thus cells of any type could be regenerated from a speck of a patient's tissue for a vast range of treatments and repair. This approach would satisfy the main promise of therapeutic cloning: create cell lines tailored to a patient that avoid the problems of immune incompatibility. It would also eliminate the need to obtain donated human eggs and, most important, avoid the moral outrage of those who oppose the use of human embryos. "
telegraph,29/05/2006 00:01,news,"An american scientist has become the first person in history to gaze at his entire genetic makeup, the DNA recipe book that he inherited from his parents.          Craig Venter, 59, one of the pioneers of the effort to read all the genes in a human - the human genome - has now gone much further and produced the ultimate autobiography, one written in six billion 'letters' of DNA. This heralds a new era of medicine, that of personal genomics.          While the first draft human genomes, unveiled in 2000, marked an extraordinary scientific feat, they were actually composites of DNA from different people: the one produced by Mr Venter's company Celera was based on five individuals, including his.          More fundamentally, the draft genomes represented only half of our inheritance. Mr Venter and a rival international consortium - backed mostly by the United States government and Britain's Wellcome Trust - had each read three billion letters of genetic code, when the cells in our bodies contain two slightly different genomes, one from each parent, making six billion letters.          A few months from now, the first entire genetic recipe of a single human will be unveiled in an unnamed journal, as a result of a new effort costing many millions of dollars.          All six billion letters of Mr Venter's DNA code will then be poured into a public computer database called GenBank, providing new impetus to the field of human genetics.          While medicine has linked scraps of DNA to disease and other traits, future analyses based on the entire genetic make-up of thousands, even millions of people, will provide profound insights into the complex relationship between nature and nurture.          The Venter DNA will eventually show the genes that act with education and upbringing to shape his health, outlook and even his personality.          Mr Venter, now the president of the J Craig Venter Institute, in Rockville, Maryland, came in for much criticism during the genome race because he was so closely identified with efforts to withhold DNA data and commercialise human genes.          Rival US government-backed scientists accused the Vietnam veteran of putting the future of biology in jeopardy with what they likened to a land grab of our inheritance.          It took the intervention of President Bill Clinton to bring about a truce.          As a result of his pressure, the rival genomes were unveiled in June 2000 at a ceremony at the White House, marking the climax of the biggest concerted undertaking in the history of biology.          There have been years of argument over who did the better job but Dr Jim Kent of the University of California, Santa Cruz, the computer ace who put the Government-led genome together, says today that Venter's draft was better - thanks in part to using his rivals' freely available data.          But behind Venter's White House triumph lay a secret. Celera had announced that its genome was blended from the DNA of two men and three women. Venter later acknowledged that 60 per cent of the genes Celera had sequenced in its $100 million effort were from his own blood and sperm.          'I have regrets about the way it was exposed publicly,' he said. As for doing it, 'I have no regrets at all.'          Now he has completed reading the rest of his DNA and produced what he calls the Human Reference Genome. So far, an analysis of his DNA confirms that he does indeed have blue eyes and suggests that Venter has a variant of Klotho, a gene linked to long life.          Dr Hamilton 'Ham' Smith, the Nobel laureate who helped apply Venter's 'shotgun' method of reading DNA code, says the project 'makes a lot of sense' because the 2000 draft genome was much criticised. Sir John Sulston, a Nobel laureate - called it a 'con job'.          The new feat proved his 'shotgun' approach works, said Dr Smith. Moreover: 'Craig wanted to be the first human ever to have knowledge of his own genome.'"
telegraph,4/9/2012 7:00,news,"New hope was raised yesterday for people left paralysed by injury, after doctors said they had succeeded in using stem cells to restore feeling in two patients. In a world first, doctors at Zurich University said two out of three men who   had agreed to take part in an early trial, had regained some sensation below   the level of their injuries. It is the first time anyone has reported a positive outcome from stem cell   therapy for severe spinal cord injury - and holds out the possibility of   greater things in years to come. The ultimate aim is to help those paralysed by injury to walk again. Stem cells are special cells that can turn themselves into almost any kind of   cell in the body. Those from human embryos have that absolute ability, while   'adult' stem cells have already specialised to a degree. For instance,   neural stem cells can specialise into different type of nerve cells, but not   something else like muscle or blood cells. The trial worked on the theory that injected adult stem cells would transform   themselves into spinal cord nerves, reconnecting brain and lower body. Professor Armin Curt, leading the study, described the result as   “fundamental”. He said: “To find something that can repair the spinal cord is a huge   breakthrough. If we can show that something has changed for the better [as a   result of stem cell therapy] that’s fundamental.”He presented the findings at the annual conference of the International Spinal   Cord Society in London on Monday. Prof Curt was working in partnership with StemCells Inc., a Californian   company which also has a base in Cambridge. Dr Stephen Huhn, from the firm, said: “We think these stem cells are one of   the first tools we have for actually repairing the central nervous system. 'To see this kind of change in patients who truly have the   worst-of-the-worst type of injury to the spinal cord is very exciting.'The three patients, who all had complete spinal injury where they could feel   nothing below the break, were each given a dose of 20 million ‘adult’ neural   stem cells about six months ago. This was primarily a safety trial, and Prof Curt said monitoring had shown “a   very good safety profile”. But detailed questioning and objective tests also showed signals were passing   up the injured spine to the brain, when they had not before. One of the patients, Knut Ølstad, a 46-year-old Norwegian financial   consultant, said: “I’ve noticed changes. When somebody touches my stomach, I   can feel something. I can’t be specific, but I can sense it.”Mr Ølstad was paralysed from the mid-chest down last summer during a cycling   holiday in the Alps. On his last descent, having cycled over 500 miles and climbed the equivalent   of two Everests, he was flipped over the handlebars after braking to avoid a   car. The recent improvement was modest, but he said: “It provides me with hope for   the future.”He believed stem cells could one day help him and others like him walk again. Prof Curt was cautious about that possibility, but Dr Huhn said: “I think it’s   in the realm of possibility.”Stem cell research for spinal injury “requires an incremental approach where   we build the therapy one brick at a time”, he added. Walking was not the only aim: people paralysed through injury also wanted to   regain sensation, bowel and sexual function, he said. The results come almost a year after another US firm, Geron, pulled out of a   similar trial using embryonic stem cells, citing cost concerns. "
telegraph,26/11/2001 00:01,news,"NEWS that a human embryo has been cloned by American researchers follows a court ruling that has made Britain the new frontier for potential baby cloners.This month's ruling - which decided that the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act does not cover an embryo cloned by the Dolly-the-sheep method - gave a boost to the pro-life lobby which, earlier this year, tried and failed to prevent the use of cloned embryos and spare in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryos for research on stem cells, the body's master cells.Yesterday's news from Advanced Cell Technology (ACT), based in Worcester, Massachusetts, will give new urgency to efforts by the pro-life lobby to reopen the debate about the limits of embryo research and what we actually mean by a 'person', also questioning whether we need to use embryos at all to harvest stem cells, the progenitors of all cell types.Prof David Prentice of Indiana State University, Terre Haute, who took part in the United States debate over research on stem cells, argued that adult stem cells offer a proven and preferable alternative to embryonic stem cells for developing treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, stroke, spinal cord injuries, heart disease and diabetes.Prof Prentice, a committed Christian who recently started adult stem research, is an adviser to more than 30 members of the US Congress and appeared last week before a Lords select committee and the European parliament.To many scientists the early embryo deserves respect - but not as much as a patient suffering disease or the ravages of old age.The pre-implantation cloned embryos produced by ACT, called blastocysts, lack a brain, heart or any recognisable feature (hence previous attempts to 'rebrand' them as pre-embryos) or feeling. Nor do they have identity, since they can sometimes split and recombine.Yesterday, a member of the ACT team, Dr Michael West, insisted that the cloned embryo they had produced was 'cellular life' and not a human life.Those in favour of 'therapeutic cloning', such as Dr West, argue it would be unethical, even cruel, to put the rights of this embryo above those of a patient given that we live in an age of abortion, 'spare' IVF embryos are often destroyed and human life can be taken with justification in circumstances such as war.Unlike a foetus, murderer or enemy soldier, a blastocyst is not sentient or rational. No cruelty to it is therefore possible. Moreover, to ban all embryo research could result in incalculable suffering in future.The pro-life lobby counters that an embryo is sacred and to use it is tantamount to human sacrifice.To Prof Prentice, the blastocyst's hollow ball of about 100 cells, smaller than the full stop at the end of this sentence, really is a person.He takes 'potentiality' as his baseline for life: at the moment of fertilisation, that person is born. But cloning does not require fertilisation.Here Prof Prentice switches his definition: a person results when a person's genetic makeup is placed inside an egg, akin to how Dolly was created (even though the Pro-Life Alliance successfully argued in court that a cloned embryo is not legally an embryo).Another criticism of potentiality is that if, and only if, a blastocyst implants in the womb does it have any potential to become a baby (Dr West said there were no plans to implant the cloned embryo into the uterus of a woman not least because reproductive cloning is too dangerous.) But the same could be said for a newborn baby, which would die without a nourishing environment, Prof Prentice replies. Potentiality may also be too broad a concept to be useful: skin cells now have the potential to become unique individuals ever since the cloning of Dolly showed that any cell can be roped in to create a new individual. Scientists want to study embryonic stem cells because they are the mothers of all foetal and adult cells. Once isolated, the cells can differentiate and expand without limit. They would have to be genetically altered, or used with drugs, if rejection were to be prevented. That is why ACT and others aim to create cloned embryos because it would allow a doctor to grow a patient's own tissue.Prof Prentice counters that cloning early embryos is unnecessary in the light of advances in research on adult stem cells, which can make many types. Adult stem cells can generate a cornucopia of cell types, from heart, liver, and muscle to intestine, according to a study by Dr Jonas Frisen and colleagues. Prof Prentice said it is not justifiable to destroy embryos when this less morally problematic alternative exists. But Dr Frisen, who is at the forefront of the field, argues too little is known to do away with embryonic research. He said: 'Adult stem cells do not have the same potential as embryonic stem cells and research on both are warranted.' Stem cell research on embryos left over from the creation of test tube babies, also allowed by recent changes, is not affected by the recent ruling. Prof Prentice also opposes such research and would refuse resulting treatments, even if he had an awful neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's."
telegraph,15/10/2014 00:00,news,"Patients suffering from macular degeneration had their vision partially restored by a transplant of embryonic human stem cells, US scientists have confirmed A single transplant of stem cells has helped restore the sight of patients   suffering from incurable forms of blindness, scientists have confirmed. 18 patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or Stargardt's macular   dystrophy have been taking part in a three-year trial to see whether human   embryonic stem cells could correct their vision loss. Scientists in the US announced that the transplants had been successful and   disclosed that more than half of patients had seen significant improvement   in their sight. The breakthrough, which could offer new hope to the 500,000 people in Britain   who suffer from AMD, was hailed as a ‘major accomplishment’ by experts. 'Our results suggest the safety and promise of stem cells to alter   progressive vision loss in people with degenerative diseases and mark an   exciting step towards using embryonic stem cells as a safe source of cells   for the treatment of various medical disorders,” said Professor Steven   Schwartz, one of the study leaders from the Jules Stein Eye Institute in Los   Angeles. No effective treatments exist for either (AMD) or Stargardt's macular   dystrophy, both of which can result in complete blindness caused by the loss   of light-receiving photoreceptor cells in the retina. The new treatment uses stem cells to recreate a type of cell in the retina   that supports those photoreceptors. Stem cells derived from embryos that are only a few days old have the ability   to develop into any kind of tissue in the body. By bathing the stem cells in a specially formulated cocktail of chemicals the   scientists were able to stimulate them into turning into fully mature   retinal pigment epithelium cells. They were then transplanted directly into   the eyes of patients suffering from blindness.Tests showed substantial improvement in 10 of 18 treated eyes. Eight patients   were able to read more than 15 additional letters on a sight chart in their   first year after treatment. 'Embryonic stem cells have the potential to become any cell type in the   body, but transplantation has been complicated by problems including the   risk of tumour formation and immune rejection,” said Professor Robert Lanza,   chief scientific officer at the US company Advanced Cell Technology, which   funded the research. 'As a result, sites that do not produce a strong immune response, such as   the eye, have become the first parts of the human body to benefit from this   technology.' The transplants have proved controversial because they use stem cells derived   from spare human embryos left over from IVF treatment. But experts said the announcement showed that such therapies could bring real   benefits. Anthony Atala, director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine   in Winston-Salem, US, said: “The work by Schwartz and colleagues is a major   accomplishment, but the path to get to this point has not been smooth. “Since the discovery of human embryonic stem cells in 1998, much has   transpired, including political, ethical, and scientific debates, with an   overall push to achieve the promise of human therapies. “Much work remains to be done before stem cell therapies go beyond regulatory   trials, but the path is now set in motion.”The study was published in the medical journal The Lancet.

telegraph,25/10/2001 00:00,news,"SCIENTISTS announced last week that they can create designer sperm, making it easier to conduct genetic modification that can affect future generations.                               Genetically modified delivery: sperm can now be programmed to carry only approved gene material          Gene therapy has been conducted for the past decade on various cells in the body and, in the past year or two, shown the first signs of success in treating children who lack an immune system.Last week's announcement concerns germline gene therapy that could cross the generation barrier.This refers to efforts to genetically reprogramme patients' 'germline' cells - their eggs or sperm - so that they can prune unwanted genes from their family trees, offering a permanent solution to genetic diseases.Altering the genetic makeup of unborn descendants has been of concern because genes interact in complicated ways. The eradication of certain so-called disease genes could have unexpected side effects and errors could wreak havoc in a person's genetic legacy.The work reported last week by Prof Ralph Brinster and colleagues in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences involved a 'reporter gene' - one designed to be easily detected - being introduced into sperm-producing cells in mice and passed to future generations.Last week, Prof Brinster said: 'These cells are thought by some to provide the best approach should human germline gene therapy be undertaken in the future.'In the short term, Prof Brinster's work will aid efforts to understand sperm production, and it could make it easier to modify animals genetically, whether to provide more accurate models of human diseases, produce drugs in their milk, or improve disease resistance.It might also make it easier to carry out germline gene therapy. The sperm producing 'spermatogonial' stem cells are the only cells in the body that both undergo self-renewal after birth and contribute genes to subsequent generations.Attempts to alter this unique type of stem cell genetically by infecting them with retroviruses 'fitted' with foreign genes have met with little success so far.Now, however, Prof Brinster's team has used a retrovirus to insert foreign genes into 20 per cent of mouse spermatogonial stem cells in laboratory experiments, representing a 10-fold improvement over previous attempts.The inserted foreign genes appear in approximately 4.5 per cent of the offspring of mice transplanted with the altered stem cells. Furthermore, the mice transmit their foreign genes for at least three generations.These results indicate that there is no intrinsic barrier to the genetic engineering of spermatogonial stem cells using retroviruses and that, once inserted, the foreign genes will continue to be transmitted from one generation to the next.To ensure that a devastating genetic disease is not passed on, human sperm cell precursors could be removed from the testes of a man, 'fixed' by the addition of a curative gene, then re-implanted into the man, where they would generate repaired sperm. Children conceived with such sperm would not have their father's disease, nor would their offspring.To ensure that genetic modification has been successful, Prof Brinster could call on an earlier development when he transplanted the sperm-producing cells from rats into the testes of mice, showing that male infertility could one day be treated by growing human sperm in mice.In the case of human germline gene therapy, it may be prudent to transplant the genetically modified human sperm precursor cells into mice or rat testes. The rodents would then produce an endless supply of genetically corrected human sperm, which could be harvested and tested before getting mixed with eggs from the man's wife using standard in vitro fertilisation procedures."
telegraph,29/04/2014 07:06,news,"Scientists have used human cloning techiques to create healthy stem cells from a diabetic patient which they hope will produce insulin when transplanted into the body Human cloning has been used to create stem cells which could cure diabetes by   triggering insulin production. For the first time, scientists have successfully replaced the damaged DNA of a   type 1 diabetes sufferer with the healthy genetic material of an infant   donor.It is hoped that when these cells are injected back into the diabetic patient   they will begin to produce insulin of their own accord. Using the cloning technique which produced Dolly the sheep in 1996, the   procedure would prevent the need for daily insulin injections and   effectively ‘cure’ the disease. “We are now one step closer to being able to treat diabetic patients with   their own insulin-producing cells,” said Dr Dieter Egli, the New York Stem   Cell Foundation scientist who led the research. 'From the start, the goal of this work has been to make patient-specific   stem cells from an adult human subject with type 1 diabetes that can give   rise to the cells lost in the disease.” Patients with type 1 diabetes lack insulin-producing beta cells, resulting in   insulin deficiency and high blood-sugar levels. Because the stem cells are made using a patient's own skin cells, the   engineered cells for replacement therapy would matching the patient's DNA   and so would not be rejected. It is hoped that in future the stem cell therapy could be used for a wide   range of conditions including Parkinson's disease, macular degeneration,   multiple sclerosis, and liver diseases and for replacing or repairing   damaged bones. 'I am thrilled to say we have accomplished our goal of creating   patient-specific stem cells from diabetic patients using somatic cell   nuclear transfer,' said Susan Solomon, CEO and co-founder of NYSCF   whose own son is Type-1 diabetic. 'Seeing today's results gives me hope that we will one day have a cure   for this debilitating disease.” The technique works by removing the nucleus from an adult oocyte – an early   stage egg - and replacing it with the nucleus of a healthy infant skin cell. An electric shock causes the cells to begin dividing until they form a   ‘blastocyst’ – a small ball of a few hundred cells which can be harvested. Dr. Rudolph Leibel, a co-author and co-director with Dr. Robin Goland of the   Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, where aspects of these studies were conducted,   said: “The resulting technical and scientific insights bring closer the   promise of cell replacement for a wide range of human disease.'In 2011, the team reported creating the first embryonic cell line from human   skin using nuclear transfer when they made stem cells and insulin-producing   beta cells from patients with type 1 diabetes. However, those stem cells were triploid, meaning they had three sets of   chromosomes, and therefore could not be used for new therapies. Earlier this month a separate team reported that they had used human cloning   to create stem cells for adults for the first time in a breakthrough which   could lead to tissue and organs being regrown. Researchers were able for the first time to turn adult human skin cells into   stem cells, which can grow into any type of tissue in the body. Last year a team managed to create stem cells from the skin cells of babies   but it was unclear whether it would work in adults. A team at the Research Institute for Stem Cell Research at CHA Health Systems   in Los Angeles and the University of Seoul said they had achieved the same   result with two men, one aged 35 and one 75. However, both breakthroughs are likely to reignite the debate about the ethics   of creating human embryos for medical purposes and the possible use of the   same technique to produce cloned babies – which is illegal in Britain. Dr Solomon said: 'This research is strictly for therapeutic purposes.   Under no circumstances do we or any other responsible scientific group have   any intention to use this technique for human cloning, nor would it be   possible.'The study was published in the journal Nature.

telegraph,19/10/2010 10:04,news,"Scientists working in stem cell research believe that they are about to change medicine forever, writes Michael Day.Professor Pete Coffey, of University College London, like many other stem-cell scientists,   has a spring in his step these days. His team is set to conduct the first   test of an embryonic stem cell-based treatment on patients in the UK. Approval from the Medicines and Healthcare   products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to test a therapy that he hopes will cure   macular degeneration, the most common form of blindness among older people   in the western world, is unlikely before 2012. However, Prof Coffey is   confident that the regulator will give the go-ahead. This is due in no small part to events in the US, where it was announced last   week that doctors had begun the first trial in which patients with   spinal-cord injuries will receive tissue grown from human embryonic stem   cells. The study by the Geron Corporation is primarily designed to test the safety of   the procedure; larger trials will be needed to gauge its effectiveness. But   the fact that the US Food and Drug Administration approved the trial is   testimony to important advances in stem-cell research. The progress has been hard-won. The alarm sounded in 2001 when foetal tissue   presumed to contain stem cells was implanted into the brains of Parkinson's   patients in New York, in the hope they would colonise the brain with cells   that produce dopamine, a brain chemical that is depleted in Parkinson's. In   the event, it produced side-effects described by the researchers as 'disastrous':   the cells spread out of control and the patients suffered horrific problems,   their muscles jerking uncontrollably. Subsequent warnings included one from Cornell University researchers that   showed stem cells could also generate precancerous cells. Considering what embryonic stem cells actually are, the risks of introducing   them directly into patients is not surprising. These undifferentiated master   cells that emerge a few days after conception have the potential to become   any of the 200 or so cell types in our bodies. However, they share with some   cancer cells the property of 'immortality'. This means the end parts of their chromosomes (telomeres) are continually   replenished. In normal cells, telomeres wear away with age – a process that   eventually prompts older cells, which are more likely to have suffered   dangerous genetic damage, to die. 'Scientists have learnt the lesson,'   says Prof Coffey. 'Researchers make sure the cells are differentiated   into normal tissue before giving them to patients. That's what we're doing.   That's what the Geron people are doing, and what all the other research   groups will do. The possibility of tumour-genesis [the formation of cancer]   just isn't there now.'The other important change is political. With George W Bush out of the White   House, the US, the world's powerhouse for biomedical research, is once more   publicly funding medical research with embryonic stem cells left over from   fertility treatments. The Geron scientists have grown oligodendrocyte precursor cells from their   stem cells. They hope that, once injected at the site of recent spinal   injury, these will populate the area and help regenerate damaged tissue. Prof Coffey's group is using stem cells to develop cells that support the   retina, the photosensitive area at the back of the eye. In patients with   macular degeneration, these cells start to disappear. He hopes that a patch   containing the reared cells delivered behind the retina will restore   patients' vision. 'If we start testing, we should know quite quickly   whether it works. The question is simple: can the patients see again?'He believes treatments for conditions like macular degeneration, which are   well-understood and don't require complex interactions between curative   cells and host tissue, will be the first to appear. 'Liver disease,   heart conditions, perhaps diabetes, where the concept of getting   insulin-producing cells into the body is quite simple, might be the first to   be treated.'He predicts stem-cell treatments for more complex and less well-characterised   conditions, including brain diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, will   take longer to appear. But ultimately he is in no doubt that stem cells 'will   change medicine for ever'. This is a view shared by his UCL colleague Chris Mason, professor of   regenerative medicine bioprocessing. 'There are still many years of   rigorous testing ahead and there will be setbacks and failures before we   have safe and effective cell-based therapies,'' he says. 'But this   first in man [Geron] study marks the dawn of the 'Stem Cell Age'.'  "

It is enough to make your heart bleed. Britain's biotechnology industry, once touted as the most exciting thing since Sir Alexander Fleming forgot to put his sandwiches in the fridge and accidentally discovered penicillin, is down on its luck. Having ripped through billions of pounds in just a few years, it is staggering along the street, cap in hand, serenading the dismissive fund managers that used to be its friends. Biotech's latest tune, the Pre-emption Rights Rag, is just a variation on an old theme, but at least it is catchy enough for Paul Myners to sit up and take notice.          As if he had nothing better to do, the chairman of Marks & Spencer has been asked to look into the possibility of relaxing the rules on how much new capital a biotechnology company can raise from new shareholders without consulting the existing ones first. These are called pre-emption rights, and they don't sound so very controversial. However, this is a sacred cow of monumental proportions and there will be test tubes and Bunsen burners at dawn if Mr Myners tries to clip its horns.          Pre-emption rights exist to protect shareholders, and Peter Montagnon, head of investment at the Association of British Insurers (ABI), calls them 'a vital safeguard'. 'They are shareholders' protection against dilution by the sale of shares to other people. That is a very important shareholder right,' he argues.          These rights prevent companies' management issuing shares to institutions which are more sympathetic to their aims without asking the existing shareholders, who own the company after all. It's easy to see why the ABI as well as the National Institution of Pension Funds, are deeply nervous about giving any concessions in this area to any one industry. To them, it looks like the thin end of the wedge.          The biotechnogists, however, are dancing to a different tune. They want special rules, just for them, so that drug discovery minnows can issue up to 20pc of their existing equity capital in any three-year period without asking the current shareholders' permission. At present, the limit is 5pc a year and 7.5pc over three years.          Raising the limit would bring the pre-emption rules, in the biotechnology arena at least, into line with the US. Aisling Burnand, who heads up the BioIndustry Association (BIA), reckons this is vital. 'UK biotechnology companies are unfairly hampered,' she says. 'Companies in the US enjoy greater flexibility in raising new equity capital. Bioscience is a global business and, therefore, we believe that it is important that there is a level playing field financially for bioscience companies.'          Burnand and her friends can reel off figures demonstrating why they should become the spoiled teachers' pets of the investment world - accorded special privileges because of their whizzy futuristic status. The top 10 bioscience companies in the US, she says, had to raise $700m from investors before they even reached profitability. Now their combined market capitalisations are nearer $70billion. British biotechnology companies, on the other hand, haven't managed to raise half as much - in fact, in 2002 the US raised 3.4 times more biotechnology capital than all of Europe put together.          The bottom line of her argument is that, by relaxing the pre-emption rights, her biotech babies could raise lots more dosh to spend on developing drugs. 'Financial demands on bioscience are enormous, with very heavy capital requirements before a company can become very profitable,' she says. 'When it comes to pre-emption rights, one size does not fit all. Britain's biotechnology industry is operating with one hand tied behind its back.'          In practice, she is asking for a book of blank cheques to be put into the hands of the industry's boffins. If these white-coated geniuses had an exemplary record, this might have merit, but many people have been bitten once by the biotech boys, and when it comes to pre-emption rights they are likely to be very shy indeed, as the reaction from the ABI has shown.          Most investors remember two big bioindustry disasters, masterminded by Keith McCullagh and David Horrobin. McCullagh ran British Biotech, which had a drug called marimastat, touted as the antidote to a whole range of cancers. In fact, it was about as useful as a stick of chewing gum but before that emerged, British Biotech had reached a market value of £2billion. It used this to raise money which it spent on a spanking new glass headquarters outside Oxford.          McCullagh, the owner of a 30ft yacht called Bumpy Ride, described his business as 'the new Glaxo'. British Biotech recently merged with Vernalis and the two companies combined have a market value of just £131m - and a past most people involved would prefer to forget. 'People are still angry,' says one British Biotech specialist. 'The name has coloured people's perception of the whole industry.'          If British Biotech is a bad enough example, there are others, including the salutary story of Horrobin and Scotia Holdings, the first publicly quoted biotech business to go bust. At its height it was worth £500m and Horrobin's stake was worth £70m - all on a foundation of evening primrose oil. When Horrobin died in April last year, the British Medical Journal's obituary was less than flattering.         'Evening primrose oil may go down in history as the remedy for which there is no disease,' it said. 'David Horrobin may prove to be the greatest snake oil salesman of his age.' With sites stretched from Nova Scotia to Carlisle, Scotia burnt cash like a space rocket.          Even in less extreme cases, many biotechnology chief executives have proved to be poor stewards of their shareholders' money. Oxford Glycosciences, which was later bought by Celltech, signed 16-year property leases that would cost between £9m and £16m to break, despite having only enough cash to last a few years.          There are plenty of tales of overpaid chief executives with bloated boards and flashy cars - and the results so far have been a pitiful number of drugs. Of course, there are also good scientists and excellent drug candidates in the UK. Burnand acknowledges the industry's reputation for not delivering, but blames it on lack of money. 'The UK is a much younger industry than the US,' she says, explaining why we haven't had their success. 'We haven't had their generosity of cash supply either.'          She points to smaller biotechnology companies such as Xenova, Phytopharm and Antisoma as potential beneficiaries from a change in the rules. Yet there is not a single example of a deal where the relaxation of pre-emption rights would have saved a company, or even a product. 'It's difficult to talk about what would have happened if things had been different,' she concedes.          Antisoma, effectively a satellite company of pharmaceutical giant Roche, already asks its shareholders each AGM to relax its own pre-emption rules from 5pc of capital to 10pc. Why can't all biotech companies do that? 'It's not as neat,' Burnand says.          Even she admits the issue is 'a sensitive one', and unlikely to be resolved quickly, but she and other member companies are hopeful that if Myners rejects their request on pre-emption rights, he may suggest another way to increase their fundraising. Who knows, he might just be sympathetic to the down-and-outs - even if they have brought the biotechnology blues down on themselves."

telegraph,1/2/2001 0:00,news,"THE entire genetic formula for rice has been unravelled by scientists.The completion of the 'rice genome map', announced last week by the Torrey Mesa Research Institute, part of the company Syngenta, and Myriad Genetics Inc in America, is the first project of its kind in a crop plant.                               Cracked the code: scientists now have the complete code for rice, like the GM golden rice, above          Because rice - which is the staple food for more than half the world's population - is a model for other cereals, the breakthrough will accelerate the development of genetically modified crops. It will also add fuel to the debate over GM foods and whether First World fears have obscured the technology's benefits for the Third World.Rice plants have approximately 50,000 different genes, which are written in about 430 million 'letters' of DNA, so the achievement marks the second largest genome to be sequenced to date, after that of humans.The information will be used by plant breeders to select the best progeny from creating cross-varieties of rice within five years, while biotechnologists will use it to identify and transfer individual genes from one rice variety to another so that GM rice can be made within about seven years.Because of the similarity between different cereal crop plants, the work will contribute to the study of other important cereals such as wheat, corn, and barley, and lead to new varieties. Dr Steve Briggs, president of TMRI, said: 'We are very proud that our institute has pioneered this research.'Identifying not only the genes, but their functions and how they work, will provide researchers with crucial new knowledge to improve food crops.' Rice has been grown as food for more than 5,000 years and is consumed by three billion people each day. Rice growing uses large volumes of water and, compared with similar crops, is inefficient. It is also vulnerable to drought.The dependency of so many people on rice as their staple food makes it crucial that production does not falter. The introduction of new rice varieties over the past 30 years has succeeded in doubling production. However, in Asia alone, the demand for rice is expected to increase by 70 per cent over the next 30 years.Current methods of plant breeding will only be able to increase rice production to meet part of this demand, as land, labour and water become significant limiting factors. Scientists believe that knowing the rice genome will aid efforts to improve yields and increase the crop's resilience.Dr David Evans, head of research and technology at Syngenta, said: 'Understanding cereal genetic structure and associated proteins will enable plant breeders to produce crops that are more nutritious, more productive and easier to process. We will also research new ways to protect crops from diseases or pests, and discover new uses for crop plants. This offers exciting new opportunities to improve agricultural yields and quality.'Syngenta said it will work with research institutes in the developing world to explore how its research can best be used to improve crops and benefit subsistence farmers. A spokesman said: 'It is our policy to provide such information and technology for use in products for subsistence farmers, without royalties or technology fees.'One example of the type of benefits that the research will bring is the development of a genetically modified golden rice variety that is rich in vitamin A. About 124 million children do not get enough vitamin A in their diets and it is a leading cause of blindness. It also causes up to a million deaths a year in developing countries.Prof Ingo Potrykus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology has added three genes to rice plants, two from the daffodil and one from a bacterium, to produce rice plants that make enough beta-carotene - converted to vitamin A by the body - to meet the total vitamin A requirement through a typical Asian diet.The rice genome sequence is the most accurate and comprehensive large genome with direct commercial value to be sequenced so far. The rice genome map is better than 99.5 per cent complete, compared with the human genome map, which still contains a number of large gaps and is estimated to be approximately 90 to 95 per cent complete.A public consortium, the International Rice Genome Sequencing project, aims to produce a more detailed genetic sequence by 2005."
telegraph,1/4/2008 19:30,news,"The first hybrid embryos in Europe - a blend of human and cow DNA - have been created by scientists in Newcastle.                                                      What are hybrid embryos?                                                                        Hybrid embryos: FAQs - Newcastle University                                              The hybrid embryos, which only developed for three days, were created by Dr Lyle Armstrong and colleagues at Newcastle University as part of basic research on cloning and not as part of any attempt to create a hybrid animal, which is not only illegal but thought highly unlikely for technical reasons.          The Newcastle team emphasises this is 'work in progress' and will be submitted for peer review.          The milestone, which is political rather than scientific, will trigger a furore, since the advance comes a month before MPs are to debate the future of such research, which has been condemned by the Catholic Church as 'monstrous'.          Pro life campaigner Josephine Quintavalle comments: 'This is lamentable headline grabbing not proper scientific behaviour. It does Newcastle University no credit whatsoever. The most significant line in the report is that the animal-human embryos didn't survive.'          The move to create hybrid embryos with animal eggs - cow eggs in this case - has been driven by a shortage of human eggs, which are necessary for efforts to use the Dolly cloning method to first create human embryos and then dismantle them for their stem cells, which doctors, scientists and patient groups say are vital for scientific understanding of debilitating conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.          A British Council meeting in Israel was told by Dr Armstrong that the hybrids were created by injecting DNA derived from human embryo cells into eggs taken from cows ovaries which have had DNA responsible for their characteristics removed, so called nuclear DNA, and leaving only cow DNA used to power the cells.          'We are dealing with a clump of cells which would never go on to develop beyond 14 days,' says Prof John Burn, a spokesman for Newcastle University, adding there is no intention to put the hybrids into a surrogate mother.          Nor are the hybrids 'yet progressing to the state where they are capable of creating stem cells.'          The research was approved by the fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.          The purpose of the experiments is to study the way the use of genes alters early in development, so the primary aim of research is basic understanding, not generating stem cells, said Prof Burn.          Dr Evan Harris, the Liberal Democrat MP who led the campaign to ensure that the research was not banned by Parliament, said: 'This news is interesting and even exciting but impossible to assess until it has been published and peer reviewed in the usual way.'          'Creating these sort of cytoplasmic hybrid embryos was deemed legal and legitimate under the 1990 HFEA Act and the 2001 Therapeutic Cloning Regulations by both the HFEA and by the Science Select Committee, and was approved on that basis by the HFEA after a public consultation and after approval by a further unanimous select committee report.          'Therefore it is wrong to say that this is pre-empting parliamentary debate or votes on the new legislation in this area - the statutory framework is being updated.          'That this breakthrough is considered possible in the UK is a further indication of our world leading role in this research and is a demonstration of why it is so important that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill is passed by parliament - to maintain that position.'          Prof Colin Blakemore, former Head of the Medical Research Council, says: 'The creation of hybrid embryos is not illegal and researchers in Newcastle and London were granted provisional licences for such research in January, after an extensive consultation by the HFEA. This research is at a very early stage and no results have been peer-reviewed or published.         'However, these preliminary reports give hope that this approach is likely to provide stem cells for research without the use of human eggs or normal human embryos. The new Bill is intended to confirm the arrangements for regulation of this important area of research.'          Dr Mark Walport, Director of the Wellcome Trust, adds: 'The aim of the research is to advance human health. This work emphasises the importance of the parliamentary scrutiny of this area of research over the coming weeks.'         Martin Bobrow, Emeritus Professor of Medical Genetics, Cambridge, said: ' Dr Armstrong has been working towards this for a long time and has recently been given a license to pursue this research. It would be unsurprising if he did not have early data but it is very unhelpful to speculate about how significant they are until we have more facts.'          Prof Peter Andrews, University of Sheffield, adds: 'The production of embryos by transferring the nucleus of an adult human cell to a human egg from which its own nucleus has already proved very difficult, let alone by combining a human nucleus with an animal egg. Apparently these researchers have achieved some success, but by using the nucleus from a very early embryonic cell, which might be easier to reprogram than an adult cell.          However, at the moment it is impossible to assess the significance of this report until we know more details of what has been achieved, the results have been repeated and, importantly, they have been reviewed by independent researchers in the usual way.'         Dr David King of the pressure group Human Genetics Alert, says: 'For anyone who understands basic biology, it is no surprise that these embryos died at such an early stage. Cloning is inefficient precisely because it is so unnatural, and by mixing species it becomes even more unnatural and unlikely to succeed.         'The public has been grossly misled by the hype that this is vital medical research. Even if stem cells were ever to be produced, like cloned animals, they would have so many errors of their metabolism that they would produce completely misleading data. This research is a complete waste of taxpayers' money. '          'The timing of the announcement of this non-result, just as Parliament is about to debate legislation on hybrid embryos is typical of the Newcastle lab's tendency to manipulate the media and politicians. The BBC has been duped into making this a news story, which will then be used to persuade politicians that animal-human hybrids are promising science. This is 'science-by-press-release' which breaks all the scientific community's ethical guidelines.'         The Catholic Church has branded them 'experiments of Frankenstein proportion' but Prof Burn stresses that the hybrids would never be allowed to develop beyond the 14 day stage, when they are still smaller than a pinhead and there are concerns that, because of incompatibilities between the cow and human DNA, this would not be possible.          Scientists want to extract stem cells, the body's master cells, from the resulting hybrids, in order to increase understanding of a range of diseases from diabetes to stroke and ultimately to produce treatments, though they stress the cells themselves would not be used.          The bill setting out the new legislation is not due to be debated in the House of Commons until next month. Last week Prime Minister Gordon Brown gave in to demands for a free vote on the issue. 'It is difficult to imagine a single piece of legislation which more comprehensively attacks the sanctity and dignity of human life than this particular bill,' Cardinal Keith O'Brien, archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh declared.          This is not the first time hybrids have been created. The method was pioneered by Dr Hui Zhen Sheng's team at the Shanghai Second Medical University, China, where she fused human cells with rabbit eggs to produce early stage embryos, which in turn yielded human stem cells.         Dr Sheng's team used donor cells from the foreskins of a five-year-old boy and two men, and facial tissue from a woman. They fused the nuclei (containing DNA) of the human cells with rabbit eggs from which they had removed the nuclei. The resulting embryos were dismantled and used to derive six lines of stem cells … flexible cells that can develop into any type.          They would not be used for treatments because of concerns about disease. Also, the few rabbit genes present might generate proteins that would be attacked by the human immune system.          While scientists call an embryo that is a blend of cells from different individuals a chimera, in reference to a monster from Greek mythology, these embryos have only one type of nuclear DNA and are called hybrids or 'cybrids'.          The cybrids should aid studies, for instance creating stem cells from people with hereditary diseases to test new treatments."

Sanofi has agreed to pay $74-a-share in cash for Genzyme, compared to its   initial offer of $69. Crucially, it has also offered investors in the US group further payments if   specific milestones are reached relating to new drugs and the manufacturing   levels of existing key products Cerezyme and Fabrazyme, which have been   plagued by setbacks over the last two years. These pay-outs will be made through Contingent Value Rights (CVRs), which will   be awarded to Genzyme shareholders and be publicly traded. Christopher Viehbacher, chief executive of Sanofi, said the CVRs were an 'important   value bridge between our two companies'. Sanofi could pay out as much as $14 per CVR, with $1 if multiple sclerosis   drug Lemtrada is approved by America regulators, $12 if sales reach more   than $2.8bn and $1 if Cerezyme and Fabrazyme meet manufacturing targets this   year. The Sanofi boss added: 'This transaction will create a meaningful new   growth platform for Sanofi-aventis while expanding our footprint in   biotechnology. We expect it to be accretive from year one and the CVR   structure rewards both Genzyme and Sanofi-aventis shareholders, particularly   if Lemtrada outperforms the market's current expectations.'Sanofi, like all the major pharmaceutical companies, is facing concerns about   a drop in revenues as its best-selling products, such as blood thinner   Plavix, lose their patent and become subject to generic competition. Genzyme is the world's biggest maker of drugs to treat rare genetic disorders   and will offer Sanofi avenues into new drug markets. Dominic Valder, analyst   at Evolution, said: 'A patent cliff has become a patent plateau.'Henri Termeer, the Genzyme chief executive and founder, will step down   following the completion of the Sanofi deal, although he will advise on the   integration of the companies. 'This transaction represents a new beginning for Genzyme,' he said. 'Genzyme   has a record of innovation and a unique and pioneering approach to serving   patients.

telegraph,23/11/2008 16:08,news,"Thousands of patients could benefit from a new discovery that could widen the use of stem cells in groundbreaking medical treatments. Research by British scientists has shown the body is more flexible in its production of stem cells than previously thought.The discovery widens the possibilities for the use of such cells in surgical procedures for treating damaged tissue and organs.Last week surgeons in Spain created the world's first tissue-engineered whole organ transplant  using a windpipe made with the patient's own stem cells. The patient, 30-year-old mother-of-two Claudia Castillo, needed the transplant to save a lung after contracting tuberculosis. Scientists from Bristol had helped to grow the cells.Stem cells are immature cells that can grow into a range of different tissue types.  They work in one of two modes - either producing numerous copies of themselves to increase supply, or transforming into specific kinds of cell for which there is a need. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh found that the 'decision' is taken when stem cells reach a crucial stage of development.  At this point, they either go on to differentiate into specialised cells, or revert back to their original form and start duplicating. The latter choice is made if the available 'pool' of stem cells is running too low.  Previously it was thought that once stem cells started to change they were committed to turn into specialist cells. Dr Ian Chambers, from the university's new Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine, said: 'If there is too much self renewal, the capacity to generate specialist cells to repair damaged tissues and organs is diminished. Yet if you don't have enough self renewal going on you will run out of stem cells, which could otherwise have been converted into specialist cells to help the body heal. 'This is a fine balance but gaining greater understanding of how stem cells work will help us develop therapies for a range of diseases.' Dr Chambers and his colleagues in Edinburgh are looking at ways of mending damaged bones and cartilage using stem cells and repairing livers without the need for transplantation. The new work involved the use of embryonic stem cells taken from early-stage human embryos, but the researchers believe the findings could also apply to adult stem cells.  "
telegraph,24/04/2008 00:23,news,"Two heart attack victims have become the first patients in Britain to be treated with their own stem cells in a pioneering bid to heal damaged tissue, The Daily Telegraph can disclose. The men had stem cells taken from bone marrow in their hip and injected into   their hearts within a critical five hours of the attack in an attempt to   improve their quality of life and delay or prevent the onset of heart   failure, a frequent complication. Doctors carried out the procedure within the past few days and say it is too   early to judge its success. The stem cells were injected in conjunction with angioplasty, the procedure in   which blocked arteries in heart attack patients are opened with a balloon. Researchers say the men, who have not been named, are the first two of 100   patients who will be treated with the method in a £1.2million research   project, the first to be supported by the UK Stem Cell Foundation. The procedure was designed by Dr Anthony Mathur, senior lecturer and   consultant cardiologist at Barts and the London NHS Trust and Prof John   Martin, British Heart Foundation chair in cardiovascular sciences at   University College London. The patients received treatment at the London   Chest Hospital and the Heart Hospital. In the procedure, a stem cell sample is extracted from the patient's bone   marrow. After the stem cells have been isolated, they are injected into the   previously blocked artery. Prof Martin said: 'Taking heart attack patients to centres where their   blocked coronary artery can be opened immediately has led to significant   increases in survival and decreases in the damage to heart muscle. 'Previous studies in the heart have shown that stem cell delivery to the   heart is safe. We will show whether it works in acute heart attack. Our   study combines the two new ways of treating heart attack victims for the   first time.'Although announced two years ago, the enormous bureaucracy involved in gaining   approval meant the first two patients have only just been treated. Prof Martin, chairman of a European stem cell task force, hopes that the   results of the trial will be known in 18 months when it will be possible to   judge if it can help address one of the biggest killers in the UK. Every   year, 108,000 people die from heart attack although the numbers are falling. Every two minutes, someone has a heart attack and a third of those patients   die before reaching hospital. Some randomly selected patients will receive an injection of harmless salt water for comparison, to help end controversy over   whether stem cell injections could stimulate the growth of new muscle and   new blood vessels. It has been suggested by some experts that simply injecting the heart provokes   it to release hormones that aid self-repair A similar trial is planned by Raimondo Ascione of the Bristol Heart Institute,   University of Bristol, on 60 patients and is due to start in May or June. ezxDetails were also published yesterday of another project, at a much earlier   stage, in which three kinds of human heart cells have been grown in the   laboratory, marking another advance. Embryonic stem cells are master stem cells that, in principle, can generate   the 200 or more cell types found in the body. In this study, the Canadian-led research team has turned human embryonic stem   cells into three of the major cell types in the heart - another step towards   the test-tube creation of functioning heart tissue for possible future   transplantation. This work, reported in Nature by Prof Gordon Keller of the McEwen   Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Toronto, created the cells by supplying   embryonic stem cells in the lab with a cocktail of growth factors to turn   them into heart cells. When the team transplanted a mixture of the cells into mice with heart   disease, their heart function was significantly improved. "
telegraph,24/08/2000 00:00,news,"   By Roger Highfield     PROPOSALS to broaden research on embryonic stem cells which can be used to repair a diseased or damaged body were accepted last week.                                                      Click to enlarge           Although stem cells can be isolated, they do not have the same broad potential to produce any cell type for treatments as those taken from an early embryo made by test- tube baby methods or by cloning. Prof Liam Donaldson, the Government Chief Medical Officer, who established his group to examine the issues last year, said: 'My report offers a way forward to ensure that this potential can be fully explored but at the same time ensures full and rigorous safeguards.'The Government welcomed the report from Prof Donaldson's expert group as 'an important contribution to this difficult debate'. It accepted its recommendations in full and promised to 'bring forward legislation where necessary to implement them as soon as the parliamentary timetable allows'. The report from the group on therapeutic cloning (Stem Cell Research: Medical Progress with Responsibility) made the following recommendations (given in bold type), followed by the Government's response. 1: Research using embryos (whether created by in vitro fertilisation or cloning) to increase understanding about human disease and disorders and their cell-based treatments should be permitted. The Government recognises that research involving embryos is a sensitive subject on which there are divergent views. For some people, any research involving embryos is unacceptable while for others the potential benefits of the research may be weighed against the respect due to an embryo at the very earliest stages of its development.Following consideration of the issues by the Warnock Committee in the early Eighties and extensive debate in both Houses, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 allows for research involving embryos for specified purposes under very strict conditions. It also provides for an extension of those purposes under the same conditions.Given these conditions, and on the basis of the scientific and medical benefits which could arise from research to extract stem cells from embryos at a very early stage, in their development, the Government accepts that such an extension should be made to allow for research to increase understanding about human disease and disorders and their cell-based treatments.Research using embryos created by cloning has unique potential benefits in terms of understanding how to produce compatible tissue for treatment and how adult cells might in future be reprogrammed. We conclude that such research should be allowed but only under the very stringent safeguards set by the 1990 Act. 2: In licensing any research using embryos created by cloning, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority should satisfy itself that there are no alternatives. The Government believes that the system of controls on embryo research operated by the authority provides stringent safeguards and a sound basis for regulating these extended research purposes. 3: Individuals whose eggs or sperm are used to create the embryos for research should give their consent. Requiring explicit consent from individuals whose eggs or sperm are used in research to derive stem cells provides an additional level of control and reassurance which the Government welcomes. 4: Research to increase understanding of, and develop treatments for, mitochondrial diseases using the cell nuclear replacement (cloning) technique in human eggs, which are subsequently fertilised by human sperm, should be permitted subject to the controls in the 1990 Act. Use of cloning to create a healthy egg for a woman with a mitochondrial disorder is not reproductive cloning as the newly created egg will still need to be fertilised in vitro (in the test tube) with the partner's sperm. Any resulting child would receive its genetic material from its mother and its father and mitochondrial DNA from the donor egg. Any proposed research will be subject to the same strict safeguards under the 1990 Act. 5: The progress of research involving stem cells from embryonic sources should be monitored by an appropriate body to establish if the research is delivering anticipated benefits and to identify any concerns which may arise. The Government will ask the authority to work with the Human Genetics Advisory Commission to fulfil this remit and to advise ministers of their findings. 6: Mixing human adult cells with live eggs of any animal should not be permitted. For example, cow eggs should not be used to develop human clones as was tried in America. The Government agrees. Primary legislation to give effect to this recommendation will be brought forward when the parliamentary timetable allows. In the meantime, the Government calls on bodies funding research to make clear that they will not fund or support research involving the creation of hybrids. 7: The transfer of an embryo created by cloning into the uterus of a woman (so-called reproductive cloning) should remain a criminal offence. The Government has made its position clear. On June 26, 1997, the then Minister for Public Health stated: 'We regard the deliberate cloning of human beings as ethically unacceptable.'The report from the authority and the commission considered that the safeguards currently in place are wholly adequate to forbid human reproductive cloning. The transfer of an embryo created by cloning into the uterus of a woman will continue to be a criminal offence. However, the Government will bring forward legislation to give added clarity to the ban on human reproductive cloning when the Parliamentary timetable permits. 8: The need for legislation to permit the use of embryo-derived cells in treatments developed from this new research should be kept under review. The authority and commission will be asked to advise on whether new legislation is needed in the light of their monitoring of the research. 9: Research councils should be encouraged to establish a programme for stem cell research and to consider the feasibility of establishing collections of stem cells for research use. The Government supports the recommendation that councils should avoid the need for researchers continually to create new stem cell lines or to import cell lines."
telegraph,22/06/2007 00:01,news,"                                             Audio: The highs and lows of 10 years of gene therapy                                                                        The latest health news                                             A major worldwide breakthrough in gene therapy was signalled last night after injections into the brain were used for the first time to successfully treat a degenerative brain disease.                                       In a pioneering study, researchers used the treatment to bring about significant improvements in the mobility of Parkinson's sufferers. They said it could also herald a breakthrough in the treatment of other neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's or epilepsy.         The 12 patients involved in the study - a world-first human gene therapy trial for a brain disease - all reported a substantial reduction in their symptoms after having a human gene injected.         Within months, their ability to move had improved on average by 30 per cent. Some reported a 65 per cent improvement in their mobility.         Nathan Klein, 59, the first to undergo the pioneering treatment told The Daily Telegraph last night that before the gene therapy, he had been 'in a state that nobody could survive'. He said: 'The treatment saved my life.'         Prof Matthew During, one of the lead researchers, said: 'Nathan Klein has further improved, I saw him just a week ago and he looked great, further improved since I had last seen him 18 months ago.'         Parkinson's affects about 120,000 people in Britain, with 10,000 new cases diagnosed every year. It robs sufferers of the ability to walk and even eat, causes long motionless periods known as 'freezing' as well as head and limb tremors.         As the disease progresses, higher doses of drugs are required, leading to side-effects that include involuntary movements.         Sufferers include the former world boxing champion Muhammad Ali and the actor Michael J Fox.                                       The study was carried out by a team in the United States. The lead researcher, Dr Michael Kaplitt, said: 'We believe this is a milestone - not only for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, but for the use of gene-based therapies against neurological conditions generally.'         Dr Kieran Breen, the director of research and development for the UK Parkinson's Disease Society, said: 'There are many potential ways to treat or cure Parkinson's, and gene therapy is one potential route holding a lot of promise.         'The results of the study are encouraging in terms of safety and efficacy and we look forward to seeing the results of the larger trial planned for later this year.'         The research team, from the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Centre and the New Jersey-based company Neurologix, report their findings in today's edition of The Lancet.         Parkinson's occurs when the brain cells - neurons - that release the messenger chemical known as dopamine die. Protein deposits also form in the brain, and levels of another messenger chemical called GABA - which calms overexcited brain cells - drop.         The study, begun in 2003, was carried out on 11 men and one woman with an average age of 58, who had all had severe Parkinson's for at least five years and for whom current therapies were no longer effective.         They were given injections of billions of copies of a genetically altered virus into part of the brain called the subthalamic nucleus.         The altered virus carried the human gene for an enzyme, called GAD, which helps to make GABA. Once implanted, brain cells of the patients started to make the GABA chemical, said Prof During.         To show that the treatment was truly having an effect, the doctors injected the virus into the subthalamic nucleus of each of the 12 Parkinson's patients, but only on one side of their brains. One reason for this was out of concerns for the patients' safety, after deaths caused by gene therapy.          Three months after the injections, the patients had shown up to 30 per cent improvement. Several showed improvements of up to 65 per cent.          'Will these remarkable improvements persist? Only longer follow-up can tell, but prior studies in animals, including primates, suggest that the transplanted gene does stay active for years,' Dr Kaplitt said.          'This breakthrough trial has implications that go far beyond Parkinson's research. It's taken us nearly two decades of hard work to get here, but the success of this trial lays the foundation for the use of gene therapy against neurological diseases generally.'          The researchers are planning a larger Phase 2 study in Parkinson's disease this year and a preliminary trial with epilepsy sufferers.          'This ground-breaking study represents not only an encouraging first step in the development of a promising new approach to Parkinson's disease therapy, but also provides a platform to translate a variety of new gene therapy agents into human clinical trials for many devastating brain disorders,' said Paul Greengard, the chairman of the Neurologix Scientific Advisory Board.          Prof Alan Kingsman of Oxford Biomedica, who will soon test his own gene therapy treatment for Parkinson', also lauded the results. 'This is very good news for the field of gene therapy for neurological disorders,' he said.          However, in an accompanying comment in The Lancet, Dr Jon Stoessl, of the Pacific Parkinson's Research Centre at the University of British Columbia, Canada, questioned the advantages of gene therapy over deep-brain stimulation, a current method for treating Parkinson's disease by implanting ultra fine electrodes to stimulate the brain.          'During and colleagues should be congratulated,' he said. 'But much work should be done before neurologists and neuroscientists will regard this as an effective approach.'          Prof During's laboratory grew copies of the human gene used in the therapy in bacteria from DNA isolated from a human sample and the gene multiplied with the bacteria."
telegraph,24/09/2006 00:01,finance,"            A small British company could become the first Western business to get a gene-based product approved by regulators, reigniting investor appetite for one of the hottest fields in medical research. Sylvia Pfeifer reports                  When Mark Origer watched his daughter take her marriage vows last year, he knew he had a lot to be thankful for. The 53-year-old had been fighting melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer for five years. He had tried surgery, drugs and an experimental vaccine in his fight against the cancer – all without success.          Yet Origer not only made it to his daughter's wedding but is alive and well today thanks to a trial that used genetically modified versions of his own cells. Just a month after the treatment, his tumours had shrunk in half. Of the 17 patients who underwent the trial, Origer was one of two who responded to the treatment.          Their remarkable recovery has been hailed as the surest sign yet that gene therapy is making a comeback after a series of setbacks during the late 1990s that left scientists and investors seriously dis-illusioned.          At its inception, the premise for gene therapy was simple: if genes are faulty and are causing diseases, why not replace them with ones that work using carriers to insert them into the chromosome in the cells.          The first trials were conducted in the late 1980s but scientists admit today that the technology was simply too early-stage.          Some high-profile setbacks followed. In 1999, Jesse Gelsinger, a teenager with a rare genetic disorder, died just days after researchers injected him with a virus containing modified genes. A few years later, European scientists treated 11 boys with X-SCID, popularly known as 'bubble boy' disease, which leaves victims without an immune system. The gene transfer worked, but three French boys developed leukaemia as a result of the treatment, and one of them died.          Since then, the technologies have been refined and scientists have addressed some of the early problems such as how to control the genes they insert. Part of the problem was that scientists employed a scattergun method of delivery, infusing patients with millions of genes through the bloodstream in the hope that they would land in the right place. Today, scientists area able to restrict the genes' activities to only certain types of cell.          The 'carriers' used to transport the genes into the cells also sometimes caused problems. Pure pieces of DNA are unable to penetrate cell membranes so scientists generally insert copies of the genes into viruses that can easily enter cells.          Companies have also started concentrating not so much on gene replacement but on developing gene-based medicines. -Scientists are injecting 'treatment' genes into people to try to block the formation of cancerous tumours for example, or are implanting genes that will slow the death of brain cells in patients with Parkinson's.          More and more, scientists are working on medicines for diseases that are not inherited in any simple way, such as cancer, heart disease and Aids. The Journal of Gene Medicine estimates that there are currently more than 1,000 gene therapy products in clinical trials, most of them in the US.          The first gene-based medicine has already been approved in China for SiBiono, a private company based in Shenzhen. But, if all goes to plan over the next few months, a small British company could become the first Western company to get a gene-based product approved by regulators.          Ark Therapeutics, which listed on the London Stock Exchange in March 2004, is working on a gene-based medicine that helps stop cancer returning to the brain after a tumour is removed through an operation.          Earlier this month the company announced that it had successfully manufactured a batch of the product, Cerepro, to commercial standards and that its facilities have met European regulatory standards.          'When I took Ark public two years ago, people said to me, 'Not in my lifetime' about the prospect of having a gene-based medicine on the market,' says Nigel Parker, the chief executive of Ark.          The company's co-founder and one of the world's gene therapy experts, Professor Seppo Yla-Herrtuala, says: 'In retrospect, this new paradigm in gene therapy is much more realistic. It is based on traditional pharmacology, that's why we call these gene-based medicines … The whole concept is now different and investors have now seen there is realism in the arena. Also, we can now manufacture these viruses up to the standards that the authorities require.'          The success of companies such as Ark has re-awakened investor interest in the industry's potential.          David Porter from Apposite Capital, a new single sector specialist healthcare fund, says he would not rule out investing in the field.          'I was excited about gene-based medicines seven years ago but now believe its day has definitely come,' he says.          Martin Murphy, his counterpart at biotechnology fund MVM, says the key is for investors to be 'selective' about any opportunities in the gene therapy field.          'For a series of paediatric diseases with a severe prognosis and which tend to be genetic, there is evidence that you can have a significant impact with a gene-based therapy approach. Similarly in oncology.          'The key for an investor is how long will it take to get proof of efficacy, which gives you a tradeable commodity. In instances where the medical need is severe and the imperative is very big, the risk benefit ratio stacks up,' he says.          Aside from Ark, other companies in Britain working in the area of gene therapy include Oxford Biomedica whose drug Trovax is focused on renal cancer.          In the US, another company that has a product waiting for regulatory approval is Introgen Therapeutics. The Texas-based company hopes to register its lead product, Advexin, in the US for head and neck cancer in the coming months. The company has already benefited from the interest of ColgatePalmolive, the consumer giant, which bought a 9.7 per cent stake as part of its plan to develop a mouthwash to prevent oral cancer.          David Nance, the chief executive of Introgen, says investors have not yet woken up to the full potential of the industry.          'The overall market still does not really recognise how near-term the products are.' He says the industry's development is akin to that of monoclonal antibodies – discovered in Cambridge in the 1970s these antibodies went through their own troubled times but have since created a number of blockbuster drugs including Herceptin, the breast cancer treatment, and become increasingly important to the big pharmaceutical companies.          'It takes many years to develop fundamentally new types of medicine,' he says. 'The sector has been out of favour, the roadside is littered with carcasses! For those companies that are left, there will be a historic corollary with monoclonal antibodies. Once the medicines become commercial, they will become a standard of modern medicine.'"
telegraph,24/03/2008 00:01,news,"            AGAINST                              By the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham, the Most Rev Vincent Nichols                  We hear consistently the claims that the experimentation being permitted by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill holds great promise for future cures of illness such as cystic fibrosis and MS.                                                      Embryo Bill sparks Labour row with church                                             The evidence for this is so far sparse. Very little progress has been made through embryonic stem cell research.         In contrast, all the published research points to adult stem cell research as showing far better results, even in the specific task of finding a cure for cystic fibrosis. What is to be lost in facing these facts? They actually indicate the pathways of successful research to which there are no ethical objections.         The best scientific research, which contributes to a sense of wonder and awe at the complexity and beauty of the created world, is in itself a signpost to belief in God. Those putting forward objections to the Bill are not trying to protect God, but ourselves and our society. Some of the things the Bill proposes are wrong and will do harm.         This Bill permits the commercialisation of aspects of human birth: the donation, its fundamental elements and the use of surrogates.         Research is opening up for us the possibility of engineered human birth away from a natural mother. Because we can do these things, does it mean that we should?         Are they really for our common good? The conception of a child can never simply be a question of the rights of adults.         It is also and always a matter of the rights of that new life, that child. These rights, too, must be respected.         The provisions in this Bill that permit, in certain circumstances, the need of a child for a father to be set aside neglect those rights.         And the proposal that, with the full support of the law, in these circumstances reference to the child's biological father may be omitted from the record of birth is to burden a child with the weight of a lie from birth.         That is a dereliction of our duty. Its repercussions will be felt in years to come. In these ways we weaken crucial pillars in the foundations of our common home.         To suggest that Labour MPs with conscientious objections may abstain would not be good enough.         They must have the right to vote according to their conscience on these fundamental moral issues.                     FOR                              By Dr Robin Lovell-Badge, the head of developmental genetics at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London                   The Bill provides an important opportunity to harness the potential of stem cell research to open new avenues for understanding and treating disease.           Key clauses relate to human admixed embryos — embryos that combine human and non-human material. This is a complex issue that has already been considered in depth by scientists, the Government, parliamentary committees and the House of Lords.           Research into stem cells —unspecialised cells that can self-renew and develop into specialised cell types — could help shed light on the causes of many diseases. Human embryonic stem cells — derived from very early embryos — could provide a uniquely flexible range of research possibilities and eventual treatments.          Ultimately, understanding how adult cells can be re-programmed to become stem cells could lead to a step-change in treating human disease, potentially allowing transplantation of cells containing a patient’s own DNA, thus avoiding problems of tissue rejection.           To realise these opportunities, researchers need to control the genetic composition of human embryonic stem cells. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has already offered a way to do this.          It entails transferring the DNA-containing nucleus from an adult cell into an unfertilised egg from which the nucleus has been removed. But few human eggs are donated for SCNT research.          Recent proposals by scientists offer a way to overcome this shortage. The idea is to transfer a human nucleus into an empty animal egg that acts as a receptacle in which the human stem cells develop.            Measures in the Bill mean this would be subject to defined limits and rigorous oversight by the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority.  These aggregates of cells would not be allowed to develop beyond 14 days — the legal limit for all human embryo research — and would not be implanted into a woman or animal.           Animal cells have long been used to produce human therapeutic proteins such as insulin, and transgenic mice expressing human genes have led to key insights into diseases from Alzheimer’s to cancer.  Allowing research into human admixed embryos will  generate better treatments for human disease. "
telegraph,23/11/2007 14:00,news,"            Colin Barras explains the latest row triggered by genetic modification                        Where genetic modification of crops is concerned, environmental groups are as vehemently opposed today as they were at the height of the GM food controversy of the 1990s.                                                      Telegraph Bayer Science Writer competition                                             But is GM science now in a position to allay some of the fears of environmental groups?            The GM food controversy looks likely to re-ignite in the coming months, as the European Union is poised to give the green light to commercial cultivation of a genetically modified potato. BASF is expected to begin commercial growing of Amflora, their GM potato, early in 2008.         Although Amflora is intended primarily for industrial purposes - it contains a starch that is useful in the paper industry - it may also be used in animal feed, which is where the controversy begins, says Marco Contiero, Policy Director of Genetic Engineering at Greenpeace's European Unit.         The potato carries a gene, neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII), that bestows on the potato resistance to a number of antibiotics, including kanamycin and neomycin. Both the World Health Organisation and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) have judged those antibiotics 'critically important' for human health, says Contiero.         He worries that if the gene passes to bacteria in the environment or in the gut of animals that eat the potato, antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains could appear with the potential for a negative impact on human and animal health.         'Under EU law, genes of this kind which 'may have adverse effects on human health and the environment' should have been phased out by December 2004,' Contiero says.         The fact that, in February, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) judged BASF's potato safe for commercial planting despite the presence of nptII is evidence that the EU is pushing for a commercial license regardless of the scientific evidence, thinks Kirtana Chandrasekaran, Real Food Campaigner at Friends of the Earth.         'There is tremendous pressure at the EU level to approve these crops for cultivation and a lot of attempts to push the application through,' she says. 'Member States have consistently rejected GM applications [but] they tend to be approved at the Commissions' level.'         But Peter Oakley, a member of BASF's Board of Executive Directors, disagrees. 'There's always a scepticism to new technology,' he says. Amflora is likely to be granted a commercial license because it has been shown to be safe by the most stringent of tests, says Oakley.          'If we tried to register a kiwi fruit [for commercial planting] in the EU today we would fail,' Oakley says. The kiwi fruit has so many proteins that are foreign to the European palate that, despite its natural origins, it would be refused a license under the EU's rigorous rules because of its potential to cause allergic reaction, he says.         Arno Krotzky is Managing Director of Metanomics, a subsidiary of BASF Plant Science, the company that has produced the potato. He says that Amflora can pass the tough tests required by EU law because genetic modification of crops has become a precise science in recent years.         GM science is often described as a crude tool with unpredictable consequences, but Krotzky thinks that, following a decade of study, GM scientists can offer greater precision than their critics realise.         'Back in the 1990s everyone was sequencing genes,' he says. There were projects to map every gene in anything from bacteria to humans, but there was little emphasis on studying how those genes worked, says Krotzky.         'At BASF we were actually looking at the function of genes,' he says. 'Now we not only know that the gene is there, we know what it does.'         Studying the function of genes in crops is a lengthy process that involves removing one gene at a time from the plant genome and growing the modified crop in controlled greenhouse conditions through a number of generations, says Krotzky.         Over this time, researchers can assess the precise impact each gene has on plant growth, and identify those that increase yield or benefit agriculture in some other way.         The information from this new technique offers the prospect of GM crops tailor-made for specific situations, and because the science is controllable, such crops will carry minimal risk of unwanted side effects, says Krotzky.         For BASF's GM potato, the modification process involved turning off a gene responsible for the production of an uneconomic form of starch.         Amflora contains only the form of starch that is useful for the paper industry. 'GM plant technology is now about doing something in a well-defined, directed way,' says Oakley.         But Contiero worries that, even if BASF researchers can control the precise properties of the GM crop, they have conducted too little research into the environmental impact that their GM crops could have.          [The] effects [Amflora has] on biodiversity were not considered by BASF,' he says. 'And the data analysed [by EFSA during their assessment of Amflora] concern the effects of surrounding wildlife on the potato, rather than the impact of the potato on the environment.'         Contiero thinks that this is why BASF included the nptII gene in their GM potato. The gene will help protect the potato from the environment, but the impact that nptII may have on the environment was not fully considered, he says.         Oakley admits that the addition of the gene has worried environmentalists, but says the scientific evidence suggests the gene is safe. 'The types of antibiotics [that nptII offers resistance to] are found all over agriculture and have been used of 20-30 years,' he says.         'We could replace nptII with another gene, but it would take 6-7 years and double the cost of development of Amflora. That's why we don't just replace it.'         Oakley argues that the environment poses a much greater threat to the GM potato than the potato does to the environment. 'Cultivated crops [including GM crops] only survive because you farm them,' he says.         'If you stopped farming, most crops would disappear; they're just not competitive [in the natural world].'         But GM crops are so vulnerable, or incapable of impacting on the environment, says Chandrasekaran. She points to evidence that pesticide resistant GM crops are passing their resistance to weeds by pollen transfer. 'This results in a vicious circle of escalating use of weed killers to tackle the resistant weeds,' she says.         'Given its failure to deliver on any of the benefits promised so far, there is no reason to believe that we need GM to face the current challenges,' says Chandrasekaran.         She says that conventional breeding programmes are helping to produce drought-resistant crops, often touted as a goal of genetic modification.         'A team of Japanese Researchers at Shizuoko University has been experimenting with crossing African and Asian rice to produce strains that perform well under drought conditions,' she says. 'The crossing is by conventional breeding techniques only; no genetic modification or other forms of biotechnology are involved.'

telegraph,26/01/2010 07:30,news,"A breakthrough by British scientists could help attack the root cause of cancer in the same way that weeding helps your garden. The research could speed up attempts to wipe out cancer by targeting tumour   stem cells that drive the disease. A team from Oxford University has developed a new method of isolating cancer   stem cells that can then be grown and studied in the laboratory. The technique could pave the way to developing drugs that attack cancer at its   root. Dr Trevor Yeung, from the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at Oxford   University, said: 'Cancer stem cells drive the growth of a tumour. If   we could target treatments against these cells specifically, we should be   able to eradicate cancer completely.'Until now research on cancer stem cells has been slow, since the cells are   difficult to identify and isolate from tumours. In the past scientists have tried to find cancer stem cells in tissue samples   taken from patients. The new research involves better ways of using molecular markers to identify   cancer stem cells, and maintaining the cells in simple laboratory cultures. Instead of using biopsy samples, the scientists worked with established bowel   cancer cell lines. They found that the proportion of cancer stem cells within different bowel   cancers varies widely, with aggressive tumours containing higher numbers. The research is reported today in the journal Proceedings of the National   Academy of Sciences. Dr Yeung said: 'Radiotherapy and chemotherapy work against all rapidly   dividing cells. But there is increasing evidence that cancer stem cells are   more resistant than other cells to this treatment. Cancer stem cells that   have not been eradicated can lead to later recurrence of cancer. 'It's like trying to weed the garden. It's no good just chopping off the   leaves, we need to target the roots to stop the weeds coming back. 'People have assumed that cancer stem cells made up a small proportion of   the cells in a tumour, but it is becoming increasingly clear that this is   not correct. The most aggressive tumours can have a majority of cells that   are cancer stem cells.' "
telegraph,8/11/2006 0:02,news,"A major trial of stem cells to repair heart attack damage will take part on 100 patients in London within weeks, scientists said yesterday.          The £1.2 million trial of stem cells isolated from the cardiac patients' own bone marrow is to be backed by £500,000 from philanthropists and will investigate earlier small studies which suggested that prompt action could cut deaths and suffering.          The trial is the first to be announced by the UK Stem Cell Foundation and aims to enrich stem cells from the bone marrow and then inject them into the previously blocked coronary artery within a critical five hours of the heart attack to see if stem cells can improve quality of life and delay or prevent the onset of heart failure.          The randomised control blinded trial, which will see half the patients injected with blood serum for comparison, will be conducted by Prof John Martin, British Heart Foundation chair in cardiovascular sciences, and Dr Anthony Mathur, senior lecturer and consultant cardiologist; at University College London NHS Trust and Barts and the London NHS Trust respectively.          The study begins after Christmas and will follow up findings from trials in Germany on small groups of patients, though there is much dispute about how the transplants work, whether they seed the growth of new muscle, new blood vessels or whether they exude factors or hormones that aid self repair. Results are expected in two years.          'We don't know exactly what happens in the heart. We know it is safe and we know it works in animals,' said Prof Martin, who added that this was an unusual treatment in that it came from doctors, rather than the pharmaceutical industry, since the use of a patient's own cells cannot be patented.          David Macauley, chief executive of the UK Stem Cell Foundation, said that animal tests had shown that the earlier the treatment, the better.          'This is the first project of its type in the UK to combine stem cell delivery to the heart with primary angioplasty – where the blocked arteries in heart attack patients are opened as quickly as possible,' he said. 'It addresses one of the biggest killers in the UK – 108,000 people die every year from heart attack.'          Over the last decade, a shift has occurred from people dying during the acute phase of a heart attack to those eventually dying from long- term effects, including heart failure, when the heart does not pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body.          Prof John Martin, who is also chairman of a European stem cell task force, said: 'Previous studies have shown that stem cell delivery to the heart is safe. We will show whether it works in acute heart attack. Our study combines the two new ways of treating heart attack victims for the first time.'          The London Development Agency has provided 50 per cent of the funds required to support the project and private funding of £500,000 has been donated by the financiers William Bollinger, and his wife, Judith.          One of the first Britons in the German trials was Ian Rosenberg, who had heart failure and was given two months to live. Three years ago he had his own stem cells injected into his heart to renew damaged tissue. He received a new lease of life but died a few months ago.          'Stem cell therapy transformed Ian's life ' said his wife, Jennifer. 'It gave him three years he would never otherwise have had.'"
dailymail,6/5/2015 22:30,wires,"A new kind of stem cell which knows its place could speed up progress towards revolutionary tissue-repairing treatments, scientists believe.Researchers in the US created the 'region-selective pluripotent stem cells' (rsPSCs) using a cocktail of chemical signals. Not only are they capable of developing into almost any kind of tissue, but they also colonise specific parts of a developing embryo.Possessing both properties could make it easier to develop workable stem cell therapies aimed at replacing lost tissue.The cells also offer advantages for large-scale stem cell production and gene modification.Lead scientist Professor Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said: 'The region-specific cells we found could provide tremendous advantages in the laboratory to study development, evolution and disease, and may offer avenues for generating novel therapies.'To create the rsPSCs the team developed a combination of chemical signals that directed conventional human stem cells to become spatially oriented.Human rsPSCs injected into specific regions of partially dissected mouse embryos soon began to mature and develop into early-stage tissues. In contrast, conventional stem cells failed to integrate.The region-selective cells began the process of differentiating into the three major cell layers in early embryos, known as the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm.They were stopped from differentiating further, but each layer was theoretically capable of giving rise to specific tissues and organs.A research paper on the discovery of rsPSCs appears in the journal Nature.The cells display distinct molecular and metabolic characteristics as well as epigenetic signatures - modifications to DNA that govern the switching on and off of genes.Co-author Dr Jun Wu, also from the Salk Institute, said: 'The region selective-state of these stem cells is entirely novel for laboratory-cultured stem cells and offers important insight into how human stem cells might be differentiated into derivatives that give rise to a wide range of tissues and organs.'Not only do we need to consider the timing, but also the spatial characteristics of the stem cells. Understanding both aspects of a stem cell's identity could be crucial to generate functional and mature cell types for regenerative medicine.'"

Scientists target deadly cancer stem cells                                                                        Stem cell discovery could help fight breast cancer                                                                        Have we been oversold the stem cell dream?                                              Drugs have already been developed to target these cells, which are aberrant forms of stem cells, the parent cells that turn into the various types found in skin.          Today's study focuses on skin cancers such as squamous cell carcinomas, responsible for one fifth of the 70,000 cases seen annually, in which the upper layers of the skin grow uncontrollably. This form can be deadly if it spreads, as occurs in ten per cent of cases.          They are maintained by special cancer stem cells, underlining one potential risk of stem cell therapies now under development to treat a number of diseases.          Today, in the journal Nature, Prof Joerg Huelsken of the  Cancer Stem Cell Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, reports the discovery of a chemical signal that triggers the development of the rogue stem cells, one which may play a role in other cancers too.          A protein known as beta-catenin is crucial for sustaining these cancer stem cells - in genetically engineered animals without this protein, the tumours shrink because there is no longer a signal to tell the cells to keep renewing themselves.          The team's discovery may open up a possible route to treating this type of skin cancer in humans by blocking this protein because they found that squamous cell carcinomas - the human equivalent of the mouse tumours - also rely on beta-catenin.          As the stem cells responsible for renewing normal skin do not depend on beta-catenin, targeting this molecule could help wipe out the cancer stem cells in a malignant tumour.         'Several inhibitors that can block beta-catenin signalling have been identified recently by several research groups and companies,' says Prof Huelsken. 'While we are awaiting the first clinical trials with these compounds, it would be too early to state that we have already found a cure of this cancer.'          He adds that although many squamous cell cancers can be surgically removed, this can be difficult in the head and neck and here drugs could be important."
telegraph,15/11/2011 19:39,news,"A US drug company has halted the world’s first official trial using human embryonic stem cells for financial reasons. The decision immediately sparked 'disgust’ from spinal injury charities and   others hoping to benefit from the research. Geron, a pioneer in stem cell research, said it was ending its landmark stem   cell project after a strategic review of the costs involved. The move has   stark implications for a field of medical research that offers hope of   future medicines for a wide array of conditions with inadequate or no   current treatments. The California-based company’s trial on patients with recent spinal cord   injuries, the first on humans to be approved by the US Federal Drug   Administration, began in October 2010 and four people have so far been   treated. There had been no safety issues and the decision to end the study was due to a   lack of money and the complexities of getting regulatory approval. New patients will no longer be enrolled but the progress of those already   involved, who were each injected with around two million cells, will be   followed. In the first phase of the trial, which was meant primarily to   gauge safety, the therapy was “well tolerated with no serious adverse   events,” the company said. It said stem cells “continue to hold great medical promise” but the decision   was taken after a “strategic review” of costs, and it intends to focus on   developing anti-cancer drugs instead. The ending of the programme was greeted with anger by Daniel Heumann, a board   member of the Christopher and Dana Reeves Foundation which aims to cure   spinal cord injury by funding new paths of research. The organisation was   founded by the late “Superman” actor, who was paralysed in a horse riding   accident, and his wife. Mr Heumann said: “I’m disgusted. It makes me sick. To get people’s hopes up   and then do this for financial reasons is despicable. They are treating us   like lab rats.”Stephanie Williams, chief executive of The Spinal Cord Injury Network, said:   “It seems a great loss that a clinical trial that required so much effort to   establish, and went through a rigorous FDA approval process, should falter   due to adverse economic conditions. “The spinal cord injury field stood to learn a great deal about cellular   therapies in humans from this trial and now much of this huge opportunity   has been lost.”Another company, Advanced Cell Technology, is now left as the only one   conducting human trials. It is testing embryonic stem cells on patients with   Stargardt’s macular dystrophy, a progressive form of blindness, in the US   and UK. Those who support embryonic stem cell research believe the field holds great   promise for a host of conditions including Alzheimer’s, Parkinston’s, heart   disease and stroke. Embryonic stem cells can develop into any type of cell in the body and   researchers hope one day they might be used to replace or repair damaged   tissue. However, the research is controversial because it requires the destruction of   human embryos, and opponents say it violates the sanctity of life. In the US federally funded stem cell research was halted under President   George W Bush’s administration. President Barack Obama lifted the ban in   2009 but a host of legal battles have followed. Scientists have also complained that a rush for patents on nearly every step   of the process has made it nearly impossible to advance their work. Last month the European Court of Justice decided to ban the patenting of any   stem cell process that involves destroying a human embryo, Opponents of the   research said Geron’s decision suggested the field may not be as promising   as previously thought. But Geron chief executive John A Scarlett told the New York Times: “I deeply   believe in the promise of stem cells. I don’t think that promise is in any   way, shape or form changed by what we’re doing.” The company is trying to   find partners to whom it can transfer its stem cell programmes. The highly controversial process involves removing the cells from an embryo at   a very early stage. That results in the destruction of the embryo, typically   at four or five days old. The removed stem cells can then develop into any   cell in the body. The first patient in the trial began treatment at the Shepherd Centre in   Atlanta, Georgia just over a month ago. It had been intended that the first   phase of the trial would be expanded to 10 patients. "
telegraph,26/01/2010 07:00,news,"Advances in genetic research mean that cures for killer diseases could soon be tailored to individual patients. Last week, the buccaneering biologist and genetic entrepreneur Craig Venter   made his first foray onto Twitter for almost five months. The reason? To pay   tribute, within the usual 140-character limit, to Marshall Nirenberg, a   'scientific icon' who, Venter said, made the genetic revolution possible.This little tribute to the Brooklynborn Nirenberg, who died of cancer a few   days ago, touched me because Venter is too busy to tweet much at all. He now   runs an empire of 500 scientists in Rockville, Maryland and San Diego,   California. Yet he is better placed than most to appreciate Nirenberg's   great achievements, because he once worked in the lab above him at the   National Institutes of Health, a sprawling, state-run powerhouse of research   in Bethesda, Maryland.Venter recalls Nirenberg as a reserved, softly spoken man, who was both   supporter and mentor. But more importantly, he was one of the men who   showed, through years of painstaking experiments, how the DNA code, written   in four different chemicals, is used by our cells to spell out the amino   acids that are the building blocks of proteins. For this work, which he   began in 1959, he shared a Nobel Prize.'He taught us how to interpret the letters of the code,' Venter told me this   week. 'All of a sudden, we understood how to read it. I can't think of   another single experiment that played such a critical part in explaining   life on our planet.'From the mid-Seventies, Fred Sanger, at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in   Cambridge, had developed ways to read the sequence of letters; Venter, one   of science's larger-than-life characters, was one of the pioneers who   adapted those methods, slow and laborious as they then were, to determine   the sequence of a gene, the instructions to build a protein. When he   started, it took about a decade to determine the sequence of a single gene -   and it was believed there might be as many as 100,000 in the human genome.Needless to say, Venter's loudly stated determination to be the first to read   the entire genome ruffled a few feathers. In the end, a bitterly contested   race developed between Venter and an international consortium, backed by   governments and Britain's Wellcome Trust, to decipher the human genome.   Venter spent between $100million and $300million, and the consortium between   $750million and $3billion, depending on whose figures you use.The draft of the genome was unveiled in 2000, revealing there to be far fewer   genes than originally thought (more like 25,000). In 2007, Venter published   the details of his entire genetic code. Called a diploid genome, it consists   of the DNA in both sets of chromosomes, one from each parent, and it is the   full six billion letter genome possessed by almost all of his cells (that   year, he also published his autobiography, A Life Decoded, which I edited).The details of Venter's genome told us much: that he had increased risk of   Alzheimer's, various cardiovascular diseases and wet earwax. But perhaps the   most important thing was the price. In contrast to the stupendous sums spent   by the Human Genome Project, unravelling Venter's own code cost him just a   few million dollars. By last year, the cost had dropped to around $100,000   (£62,000). Within a few years, we will be sequencing genomes for $1,000 or   less, in a matter of days, or less.For the field of personalised medicine, this will be an enormous advance,   revealing who is at risk of certain diseases, who will respond best to   particular drugs, and who will suffer the side-effects of various treatments.As the Telegraph reported yesterday, researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer   Institute in Boston have identified a gene signature that predicts a high   risk of cancer recurrence in certain breast tumours that have been treated   with common chemotherapy drugs.Thus, these findings could lead to a genetic test of breast cancers to help   doctors choose the right treatment for an individual patient, avoiding the   current trial-and-error approach that, in some cases, exposes women to the   toxic side effects of a cancer drug that is destined to be ineffective.However, there are still many challenges to overcome. It will remain the case   that much of our current understanding is muddled by contradictory   information - such as the links between genetic variation and anti-social   behaviour.Another issue is how to handle vast amounts of data. Tim Hubbard, of the   Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, near Cambridge (named, of course, after   Fred) points out that as scientists read the code of more people and study   the way the use of the code varies with age, or is corrupted by cancer, they   will generate massive amounts of information, approaching the flood of data   that physicists produce when they switch on the Large Hadron Collider and   its cousins.To cope with the deluge, we need to spend more on high-powered computers and   to share data with institutes scattered worldwide via vast central   repositories, such as the European Bioinformatics Institute. As a recent   House of Lords report on genomic medicine has recognised, this has the   potential to transform the NHS - as long as we can cope with the challenge   of organising the vast quantity of biomedical data.The Government's response to the report acknowledged the need for greater   investment in data repositories and interpretation techniques. But Hubbard's   verdict is that 'there's some progress, though not enough'.As ever, politicians have been quick to grasp the importance of the genomics   revolution - but reluctant to invest in something whose benefits will be   felt over years rather than weeks.Roger Highfield is the Editor of 'New Scientist' "
telegraph,8/8/2006 0:01,technology,"Crown gall disease is a proud gardener's worst nightmare. I visit Lindsay Stockley and she looks despondent when she greets me. She has just diagnosed the disease in a number of trees in the orchard that she tends and things are looking grim.           Beautiful and much loved shrubs and trees afflicted with the disease produce swellings, or galls, along the length of the branches and roots and often die. New plants grown in the old soil almost always suffer the same fate.            I wait for Lindsay, a professional gardener, to have a consoling cup of tea before telling her that scientists have been getting pretty excited about the bacterium responsible for this pesky disease.           The bacterium in question is Agrobacterium tumefaciens. It usually lives a fairly innocent existence in the soil surrounding the root, surviving on excess nutrients that naturally leak from the plant. However, a more ingenious and sinister side to its personality is revealed if a root is damaged or broken.           The bacterium is able to detect the presence of a wound thanks to abnormally high levels of plant nutrients flooding out into the surrounding soil, and loses no time in leaping into action.          The bacterium has a separate piece of genetic material, in the form of circular DNA, which provides it with all the tools it needs to invade the plant. Once the bacterium is inside, a section of this circular DNA, called transfer-DNA (T-DNA) is snipped out. The T-DNA then invades a plant cell, where it is incorporated into the genome, and causes the plant cell to produce the proteins coded for by the bacterial T-DNA. Infected cells grow unusually large and replicate rapidly, causing the galls on the plant that so horrify gardeners. This neat trick also causes the cells in the galls to act as food factories, pumping out nutrients for the bacteria to feast on.          This is the part that so excites scientists. Transfer of DNA between organisms of different kingdoms is exceptionally rare. When this infection mechanism was discovered, the immediate thought was that if it is possible for T-DNA from the bacterium to work its way into the plant's genetic material, then perhaps this process could be used as a vehicle for other foreign genes. This has now been achieved; by inserting a gene of interest into the Agrobacterium T-DNA, it possible to instruct plant cells to produce the protein coded for by the gene. Plants modified in this way are known as transgenic plants, which have a myriad of potential uses.          Enamul Hoque, a postgraduate working for Prof John Mansfield at Imperial College London, is modifying cultivars of rice found in Bangladesh using Agrobacterium. 'The main objective is increased food production, and development of salt tolerance. Bangladesh is particularly prone to seawater flooding, and it is a huge problem,' says Prof Mansfield.           The production of transgenic - genetically altered - rice cultivars in the lab has been successful, but, as Prof Mansfield points out, the transfer from lab to field is a complex process.           'The first thing is to educate the people living in the area that genetically modified crops, if used appropriately, are safe,' he says. 'At the moment, production is industry-led and the main aim is profit; what we need is an approach that is going to improve the situation of smallholders.'          The hope is that the successful generation of salt-tolerant rice varieties will reassure local farmers that genetic modification is a tool that can be used to their direct benefit. To this end, a large proportion of the transgenic plant technologies now being pioneered are focused on providing benefit for the communities in which they are used.           An example is the development of 'edible vaccines' - food crops such as lettuce that are modified by Agrobacterium to carry an antigen from pathogens such as hepatitis B virus, thus providing a cheap means of vaccination in less economically developed countries.          Lindsay seems consoled by this alter ego of the bug. In the future it is hoped that the potential benefits of Agrobacterium-transformed plants can be taken from lab to field in a professional and safe manner. It is then that we can hope to see Agrobacterium as a tool capable of helping to remedy worldwide problems of famine and disease with a novelty matched only by that of its biology.                      Leili Farzenah, 19, studies the use of viruses - retroviruses - for genetic engineering at Imperial College London.

telegraph,18/10/2011 15:41,news,"Cutting-edge research into new medical treatments in Britain was thrown into disarray on Tuesday as the highest European court ruled that stem cells from human embryos cannot be patented. The decision could hold back the development of new therapies and force   research away from Britain by encouraging investors to spend their money in   the US or Asia instead. British scientists are among the world's leaders in stem cell technology, but   the ruling could force us to pay foreign markets for treatments that were   based on our research but developed and patented abroad. Embryonic stem cells can be transformed into any other type of body tissue,   meaning they have enormous potential for medical treatments for a wide range   of diseases including Parkinson's, heart disease and stroke. But they are controversial because the method of obtaining the cells involves   the destruction of the foetus at a very early stage. The ruling came in a test case over a technique devised by Oliver Bruestle, a   German professor, for turning human embryonic stem cells into nerve cells. An attempt to patent his work was opposed by Greenpeace, who complained that   protecting work based on a human embryo which is later destroyed is   unethical. The ECJ said in a statement: 'The use of human embryos for therapeutic or   diagnostic purposes which are applied to the human embryo and are useful to   it is patentable.  'But their use for purposes of scientific research is not patentable.' Prof Bruestle, of Bonn University, said: 'With this unfortunate decision,   the fruits of years of translational research by European scientists will be   wiped away and left to the non-European countries.' Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, of the MRC National Institute for Medical Research,   told the Daily Telegraph that Britiain's clear and permissive laws on stem   cell experiments mean a great deal of early-stage research could still be   carried out here, but the ruling raises the chance of that work being   adopted and made profitable by companies operating abroad. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'It just does not make sense because the   technology is still going to be protected by patents but they will be   patented abroad, all the income will be generated there and the UK and   Europe as a whole will lose out.' The ruling still permits the patenting of work using adult stem cells and   induced pluripotent stem cells – adult cells artificially transformed into   stem cells – but the research potential with these is more limited. Prof Austin Smith, of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research at the   University of Cambridge said: “This unfortunate decision by the Court leaves   scientists in a ridiculous position.  'We are funded to do research for the public good, yet prevented from   taking our discoveries to the market place where they could be developed   into new medicines. One consequence is that the benefits of our research   will be reaped in America and Asia.” Dr David Scott, Cancer Research UK's director of science funding, said: “Most   UK scientists’ stem cell research involves adult stem cells, but patients   with serious illnesses including cancer could benefit in the future from   research involving embryonic stem cells.'"

The procedure involves removing a blastomere, one of eight cells that make up an early embryo before implantation in the uterus, and putting it in a culture with other stem cells to encourage it to form into independent stem cells.          The technique, used in pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) by couples with a family history of hereditary conditions such as muscular dystrophy to screen out affected embryos, allows the embryo to continue to grow normally despite the removal of the cell.          Robert Lanza, a professor of surgical sciences at the Institute of Regenerative Medicine at the Wake Forest School of Medicine in North Carolina, and one of the team, said: 'The clinical potential of embryonic stem cells is on a par with antibiotics and vaccines. Within a short period of time we will see clinical studies into their use in spinal cord injuries, other neurological disorders, diabetes, heart diseases and hundreds of other conditions.          'Their potential can only be realised with the backing of government funding and large pharmaceutical companies. However, this has not been forthcoming, certainly in the US, because of opposition on ethical grounds.          'The ability to generate human embryonic stem cell lines from PGD blastomeres could circumvent the ethical concerns voiced by many, and allow the banking of cell lines for children born from transferred embryos.'          Meanwhile researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, claim, also in Nature, that they have used a technique known as altered nuclear transfer to produce embryonic stem cells without creating an embryo, again to avoid ethical objections to stem cell work.          Dr Rudolf Jaenisch created 'embryos' that had been amended to prevent the normal functioning of Cdx2, a gene essential in the process of implantation in the uterus.          Under pressure from anti-abortion groups, President George Bush four years ago introduced a ban on federal funding for new research using stem cells from embryos that had not been destroyed before August 2001.          Dr Robert Schenken, the president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, whose members gathered in Montreal, Canada, yesterday for the start of the organisation's annual conference, said: 'The research by Prof Jaenisch and Prof Lanza and their colleagues represent important steps forward in the rapidly evolving field of stem cell science.'"
telegraph,8/6/2000 0:00,news,"GOVERNMENT plans to allow research on the cloning of embryos to make cells and tissues for transplants was thrown into turmoil last week by a study that suggests that it could soon be unnecessary.                                                      Click to enlarge            A Swedish team have evidence that a vast range of tissues to repair an ailing body can be created from 'stem' cells taken from a living patient, rather than a dead cloned embryo.Earlier this year, The Telegraph reported that a panel led by Dr Liam Donaldson, the Government's Chief Medical Officer, agreed to recommend changes to the law to enable scientists to research the use of cloned embryos to make tissues to treat the sick.The proposal has been bitterly opposed by pro-life groups, which regard a cloned embryo consisting of around 200 undifferentiated cells as a person, and the prospect of dismantling it to grow tissue for a transplant as abhorrent.The Government is thought to have been swayed by arguments by scientists who say that it would be unethical not to use these cloned embryonic cells which have vast potential in medicine for a range of treatments.Embryonic stem cells could be grown into tissues to repair a damaged body and treat degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and diabetes, as well as heart, liver and kidney conditions.However, a team led by Dr Jonas Frisén, of the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, reports in the journal Science evidence that cloning may be unnecessary: stem cells can be taken from an adult and generate a cornucopia of cell types, from heart, liver, muscle, intestine to other tissues.Dr Frisén said the use of stem cells taken from an adult 'is indeed a tantalising possibility'. But he added: 'We need to be open and pursue research in all fields until we really know which [if any] will be most valuable.'Prof Richard Gardner, of Oxford University, who chaired a Royal Society group on therapeutic cloning, said the Swedish discovery might change the nature of the cloning debate. He said: 'I think therapeutic cloning is not terribly realistic. This other approach of reprogramming later cells makes sense.'The Swedish research overturns the results of decades of study of one of life's greatest mysteries: how a fertilised egg develops into an embryo. It had been thought that, as a single fertilised egg divides to form the 100 trillion cells in the human body, cells get more and more specialised and more restricted in what they can do.It was thought that only the early embryo cells were the 'blank slates' of an organism, capable of developing into any type and providing a universal source of tissue for transplant. The more specialised adult stem cells, found in areas of the adult body such as the skin, nervous system and blood and lymph systems, were thought only to give rise to their own kind.Within the bone marrow, for instance, there are stem cells that generate all the blood cells. Similarly, there are neural stem cells that can generate all the types of cell found in the brain.The work by Dr Frisén's colleague, Dr Diana Clarke, shows that when adult neural stem cells are removed from mice and grown with embryonic cells or within an embryo, the adult stem cells can revert to an unspecialised state and give rise to a range of cell lineages.The research adds to a growing body of data indicating that adult stem cells, like embryonic stem cells, may be more versatile than previously thought. This has political implications and will fuel the efforts by pro-life groups to halt proposals to use cloned embryos to grow a patient's tissue.The study confirmed that adult stem cells are more chameleon-like than previously thought, taking cues from their cellular environment to produce offspring to match the cells around them."
telegraph,20/06/2014 07:02,news,"Patients suffering from tendinopathy could benefit from stem cell treatment currently used in horses A stem cell treatment first used on racehorses could help humans battle a   crippling Achilles tendon disease, scientists have revealed. The existing treatment for Achilles tendinopathy which causes pain in the heel   and tendon, helped a horse called Dream Alliance recover and go on to win   the 2009 Welsh Grand National. The study, published in the Lancet, shows how stem cells are taken from the   sufferer and transplanted directly onto the damaged Achilles tendon. With race horses the injury rate fell by 50 per cent since stem cell treatment   became available. Tendinopathy affects 85,000 people across the UK every year and can   particularly effect among athletes. Non surgical treatments are limited,   many are eventually forced to consider surgery. The UK Stem Cell Foundation is funding the first ever human study which will   involve 10 patients. It is hoped that this could lead to access to a new treatment within three to   five years. Stem cells will be removed from each patient, expanded in the laboratory, then   implanted onto the damaged tendon. Andy Goldberg, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon at the Royal National   Orthopaedic Hospital, who will lead the study, said: 'There is a real   need for effective, non-surgical treatments for Achilles Tendinopathy.  'We have seen stem cell treatments produce impressive outcomes in race   horses and this trial will be the first step towards seeing if this is also   a viable treatment in humans.  'If things go well, we are hopeful this treatment could have a   life-changing impact on patients.' Sir Richard Sykes, Chairman of the UK Stem Cell Foundation, added: 'The   UK Stem Cell Foundation is delighted to support this first-in-man study.  'Our mission is to help address the critical gap in funding that is   hindering the progress of promising stem cell research into new treatments.  'The Autologous Stem Cells in Achilles Tendinopathy study (ASCAT) is an   exciting example of taking preclinical work in a natural animal disease   model and translating it for human benefit'. "
telegraph,27/04/2011 23:57,news,"Potential cures for dozens of debilitating conditions are under threat from a European ruling that claims that making money from embryonic stem cell research is immoral, leading scientists have warned.The academics said that a change in EU law could 'wipe out' much of   the biotechnology industry. Britain is a world leader in the use of stem   cells, with researchers working on treatments for blindness, Alzheimer's and   Parkinson's, as well as coming up with an alternative to testing drugs on   animals.But scientists say much of   this work would be moved to China and the US if the European Court of   Justice makes a directive that would effectively outlaw the use of human   embryos for commercial purposes.EU judges are considering a test case that could make it unlawful to patent   applications using embryonic stem cells, or anything derived from them, on   moral grounds.The academics are concerned because Yves Bot, the court's advocate general who   provides independent guidance, said that patenting any use of cells derived   from human embryos breached ethical principles. Although the French judge's   opinion is not binding, the court follows his advice in eight out of 10   judgments. A European legal ban on embryonic stem cell patents will have potentially   catastrophic consequences for the multi-billion-pound European biotech   industry, the British economy, and patients, according to the scientists.They say it will lead to a withdrawal of funding and force patients to go   abroad for treatments.Thirteen researchers have written to the journal Nature outlining their   concerns. They include Professor Ian Wilmut, the creator of Dolly the Sheep,   the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell, and Professor Austin   Smith, director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research in   Cambridge.Prof Smith called Mr Bot’s opinion “astonishing and shocking”, and said that   without the contribution of industry that patents made possible, the   development of stem cell therapies could stop.“If the European Court of Justice was to follow this opinion then the reality   ... is that all patents in Europe that involve human embryonic stem cells   will be eliminated,” he said. “Other patents will apply in the United   States, China and Japan, so this will put Europe at a huge disadvantage. It   will effectively wipe out the European biotech industry in this area.”The scientists say that licensing authorities would effectively be prevented   from approving therapies based on “immoral” commercialisation of embryonic   stem cells. More than 100 patents on embryonic stem cell products have already been    in Europe. But advanced stem cell treatments are only just starting to make   the transition from the lab to the clinic.The first British trial, led by Professor Pete Coffey from University College   London, will use cells derived from embryonic stem cells to treat an   incurable form of age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease affecting   700,000 people in Britain.Prof Coffey, one of the letter signatories, said: “There’s an ethical need to   treat disease which appears to have been lost in this whole debate.” "
telegraph,17/02/2011 19:06,news,"Professor Ernest McCulloch, who died on January 20 aged 84, was a medical researcher who, with James Till, identified what we know today as stem cells; such is the importance of the cells that some have likened McCulloch and Till to Watson and Crick – the duo who discovered DNA.There are more than 200 kinds of cells in the human body, many of which are   tailored to perform specific tasks. Stem cells are “blank” cells which can   both reproduce themselves and be encouraged to develop into specific cells. As such they are viewed by many within medicine as a unique tool for healing,   with the potential to rebuild damaged nerves or organs. Cancer, blindness,   brain damage, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, arthritis and diabetes are just some   of the conditions which hopeful researchers say could be defeated with the   help of stem cells. Concerned religious groups, however, view stem cell research as a trespass by   mortal man into the divine realm of creation. A decade ago, for example,   President George W Bush reacted to such worries by strictly limiting   publicly funded work in the field.Such controversy was far from McCulloch’s mind as he examined irradiated mice   spleen one Sunday afternoon in the early 1960s. With nuclear war then   considered a very real prospect, he and his research partner had been funded   by Canada’s Defence Research Board to investigate ways of treating the   effects of radiation.McCulloch was keen to test how mice which had been subjected to lethal doses   of radiation would respond to injections of bone marrow. But the head of   physics at the Ontario Cancer Institute, Harold Johns, who had developed   Cobalt-60 radiation equipment to treat cancer, was loth to let a researcher   near his hi-tech machines. He demanded a specialist volunteer to handle the radiation work. Till   responded. “But once we began working together,” noted McCulloch, “we were   both doing everything and have been doing everything together really ever   since.”They proved a great team. McCulloch focused on big ideas, while Till was the   “details man”. But it was McCulloch who first noted the detail that led to   their dramatic breakthrough. While studying the mice spleen he noticed lumps   – or blood cell “colonies” – which corresponded in number to the marrow   cells he had transplanted into the rodents. In a paper published in 1961 in   the little-known journal Radiation Research, the two men noted that “the   identity of the cells giving rise to colonies is uncertain. Owing to this   uncertainty, we will refer to cells with the capacity to form colonies as   'colony-forming units’.”Between 1961 and 1963 (with the crucial help of McCulloch’s research student,   Andy Becker), the pair were able to identify these colony forming units as   single cells in the bone marrow transplant – stem cells – which had the   ability to reproduce and develop into several different blood cells types   within the “colony”.“It proved for the first time that there was such a thing as a stem cell,”   said McCulloch. And this time their findings were published in Nature. “I do   remember the feeling,” Till said, looking back on the discovery 40 years   later, “it was exhilaration.” Soon the practical implications became clear as, in 1968, doctors at the   University of Minnesota performed the first bone marrow transplant on a   human, and watched as stem cells renewed the body’s capacity to generate   blood.Ernest Armstrong McCulloch was born in Toronto on April 27 1926, the son of a   doctor of old Scottish stock. Ernest, known as “Bun”, was educated at Upper   Canada College, a private high school, and medical school at the University   of Toronto, where he graduated with honours in 1948. He worked in hospitals   in Toronto and ran a private practice in the city from 1954, but soon began   his research career. He studied at the Lister Institute in London for a year before returning to   laboratories at the University of Toronto and at the Ontario Cancer   Institute. In the decades after their stem-cell breakthrough, both McCulloch   and Till continued to research, and to bring through doctors into the new   field of cellular science that they had created.Ernest McCulloch, a stocky, rumpled man was, with Till, the recipient of a   host of prizes including, in 2005, the Albert Lasker award. Half of those   who win the Lasker go on to win a Nobel, but Till and McCulloch were not so   honoured. Till, who is now 79, speculated that the controversy over “just   about everything to do with stem cells – stem cell science, stem cell   ethics, stem cell politics – the whole bit” could have militated against   them.But there were other reasons to be content. Unlike in many medical research   partnerships, the two men remained the best of friends. “One of the things   I’m happiest about is that even now, all these years later, we’re very good   friends,” said McCulloch at the Lasker award ceremony. “I could tell Dr Till   anything and it was confidential and be entirely certain that it would not   go further at all. I think he feels the same way about me.”“I do,” said Till, who wiped away a tear as he added: “Our work never   threatened our personal regard and respect for each other.”Ernest McCulloch is survived by his wife, Ona, and five children.

telegraph,17/08/2000 00:00,news,"PROPOSALS to broaden research on embryonic stem cells which can be used to repair a diseased or damaged body were accepted yesterday.                                                      Click to enlarge           Although stem cells can be isolated, they do not have the same broad potential to produce any cell type for treatments as those taken from an early embryo made by test- tube baby methods or by cloning.Prof Liam Donaldson, the Government Chief Medical Officer, who established his group to examine the issues last year, said: 'My report offers a way forward to ensure that this potential can be fully explored but at the same time ensures full and rigorous safeguards.'The Government welcomed the report from Prof Donaldson's expert group as 'an important contribution to this difficult debate'. It accepted its recommendations in full and promised to 'bring forward legislation where necessary to implement them as soon as the parliamentary timetable allows'.The report from the group on therapeutic cloning (Stem Cell Research: Medical Progress with Responsibility) made the following recommendations (given in bold type), followed by the Government's response. 1: Research using embryos (whether created by in vitro fertilisation or cloning) to increase understanding about human disease and disorders and their cell-based treatments should be permitted. The Government recognises that research involving embryos is a sensitive subject on which there are divergent views. For some people, any research involving embryos is unacceptable while for others the potential benefits of the research may be weighed against the respect due to an embryo at the very earliest stages of its development.Following consideration of the issues by the Warnock Committee in the early Eighties and extensive debate in both Houses, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 allows for research involving embryos for specified purposes under very strict conditions. It also provides for an extension of those purposes under the same conditions.Given these conditions, and on the basis of the scientific and medical benefits which could arise from research to extract stem cells from embryos at a very early stage, in their development, the Government accepts that such an extension should be made to allow for research to increase understanding about human disease and disorders and their cell-based treatments.Research using embryos created by cloning has unique potential benefits in terms of understanding how to produce compatible tissue for treatment and how adult cells might in future be reprogrammed. We conclude that such research should be allowed but only under the very stringent safeguards set by the 1990 Act. 2: In licensing any research using embryos created by cloning, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority should satisfy itself that there are no alternatives. The Government believes that the system of controls on embryo research operated by the authority provides stringent safeguards and a sound basis for regulating these extended research purposes. 3: Individuals whose eggs or sperm are used to create the embryos for research should give their consent. Requiring explicit consent from individuals whose eggs or sperm are used in research to derive stem cells provides an additional level of control and reassurance which the Government welcomes. 4: Research to increase understanding of, and develop treatments for, mitochondrial diseases using the cell nuclear replacement (cloning) technique in human eggs, which are subsequently fertilised by human sperm, should be permitted subject to the controls in the 1990 Act. Use of cloning to create a healthy egg for a woman with a mitochondrial disorder is not reproductive cloning as the newly created egg will still need to be fertilised in vitro (in the test tube) with the partner's sperm. Any resulting child would receive its genetic material from its mother and its father and mitochondrial DNA from the donor egg. Any proposed research will be subject to the same strict safeguards under the 1990 Act. 5: The progress of research involving stem cells from embryonic sources should be monitored by an appropriate body to establish if the research is delivering anticipated benefits and to identify any concerns which may arise. The Government will ask the authority to work with the Human Genetics Advisory Commission to fulfil this remit and to advise ministers of their findings. 6: Mixing human adult cells with live eggs of any animal should not be permitted. For example, cow eggs should not be used to develop human clones as was tried in America. The Government agrees. Primary legislation to give effect to this recommendation will be brought forward when the parliamentary timetable allows. In the meantime, the Government calls on bodies funding research to make clear that they will not fund or support research involving the creation of hybrids. 7: The transfer of an embryo created by cloning into the uterus of a woman (so-called reproductive cloning) should remain a criminal offence. The Government has made its position clear. On June 26, 1997, the then Minister for Public Health stated: 'We regard the deliberate cloning of human beings as ethically unacceptable.'The report from the authority and the commission considered that the safeguards currently in place are wholly adequate to forbid human reproductive cloning. The transfer of an embryo created by cloning into the uterus of a woman will continue to be a criminal offence.However, the Government will bring forward legislation to give added clarity to the ban on human reproductive cloning when the Parliamentary timetable permits. 8: The need for legislation to permit the use of embryo-derived cells in treatments developed from this new research should be kept under review. The authority and commission will be asked to advise on whether new legislation is needed in the light of their monitoring of the research. 9: Research councils should be encouraged to establish a programme for stem cell research and to consider the feasibility of establishing collections of stem cells for research use. The Government supports the recommendation that councils should avoid the need for researchers continually to create new stem cell lines or to import cell lines."

telegraph,23/10/2001 00:01,news,"SCIENTISTS announce today that they can create designer sperm, making it easier to conduct genetic modification that can affect future generations.Gene therapy has been conducted for the past decade on various cells in the body and, in the past year or two, shown the first signs of success in treating children who lack an immune system.Today's announcement concerns germline gene therapy that could cross the generation barrier.This refers to efforts to genetically reprogramme patients' 'germline' cells - their eggs or sperm - so that they can prune unwanted genes from their family trees, offering a permanent solution to genetic diseases.Altering the genetic makeup of unborn descendants has been of concern because genes interact in complicated ways. The eradication of certain so-called disease genes could have unexpected side effects and errors could wreak havoc in a person's genetic legacy.The work reported today by Prof Ralph Brinster and colleagues in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences involved a 'reporter gene' - one designed to be easily detected - being introduced into sperm-producing cells in mice and passed to future generations.Yesterday, Prof Brinster said: 'These cells are thought by some to provide the best approach should human germline gene therapy be undertaken in the future.'In the short term, Prof Brinster's work will aid efforts to understand sperm production, and it could make it easier to modify animals genetically, whether to provide more accurate models of human diseases, produce drugs in their milk, or improve disease resistance.It might also make it easier to carry out germline gene therapy. The sperm producing 'spermatogonial' stem cells are the only cells in the body that both undergo self-renewal after birth and contribute genes to subsequent generations.Attempts to alter this unique type of stem cell genetically by infecting them with retroviruses 'fitted' with foreign genes have met with little success so far.Now, however, Prof Brinster's team has used a retrovirus to insert foreign genes into 20 per cent of mouse spermatogonial stem cells in laboratory experiments, representing a 10-fold improvement over previous attempts.The inserted foreign genes appear in approximately 4.5 per cent of the offspring of mice transplanted with the altered stem cells. Furthermore, the mice transmit their foreign genes for at least three generations.These results indicate that there is no intrinsic barrier to the genetic engineering of spermatogonial stem cells using retroviruses and that, once inserted, the foreign genes will continue to be transmitted from one generation to the next.To ensure that a devastating genetic disease is not passed on, human sperm cell precursors could be removed from the testes of a man, 'fixed' by the addition of a curative gene, then re-implanted into the man, where they would generate repaired sperm. Children conceived with such sperm would not have their father's disease, nor would their offspring.To ensure that genetic modification has been successful, Prof Brinster could call on an earlier development when he transplanted the sperm-producing cells from rats into the testes of mice, showing that male infertility could one day be treated by growing human sperm in mice.In the case of human germline gene therapy, it may be prudent to transplant the genetically modified human sperm precursor cells into mice or rat testes. The rodents would then produce an endless supply of genetically corrected human sperm, which could be harvested and tested before getting mixed with eggs from the man's wife using standard in vitro fertilisation procedures."
telegraph,3/6/2011 7:00,news,"Scientists have made a discovery that could enable leukaemia sufferers to be completely rid of the disease.British researchers found a way to destroy stem cells that sustain the   potentially fatal blood cancer, in an early study on mice.The team from King’s College London, funded by Cancer Research UK, learned   that suppressing two particular proteins stops the leukaemia stem cells   growing.This could pave the way for better treatment that may enable patients to be in   'complete remission'.Prof Peter Johnson, the leading charity’s chief clinician, said: “This study   builds on previous Cancer Research UK-funded work trying to pinpoint the   molecules responsible for driving the development of MLL-related leukaemia   stem cells.“Cancer stem cells appear to be more resistant to radiotherapy and   chemotherapy than the other leukaemia cells, so understanding how they   originate – and how we can kill them – will be a major step in being able to   help even more people survive leukaemia in future.”As many as 28,500 people are diagnosed with leukaemia in Britain every year   and about 70 per cent of children and 10 per cent of adults have a type that   involves mutations of the MLL gene. Only half of these children survive for   two years after receiving standard treatment.But in a paper published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, researchers at   King’s describe how they found a way to “abolish” the MLL stem cells.They already knew that a protein called Bmi1 played a key role in the survival   and growth of cancer stem cells, but also found high levels of another   protein, called Hoxa9, in mice and human patients with MLL leukaemia.The team was able to suppress both these proteins and so remove the ability of   the stem cells to grow.Professor Eric So, Head of the Leukaemia and Stem Cell Biology group at   King’s, said: “These findings take us a step forward in our understanding of   how this devastating disease can return in patients after they have received   the standard treatment.“Now we know that leukaemic stem cells in certain types of leukaemia, such as   MLL, can survive and proliferate independently of the Bmi1 protein, we need   to consider more carefully the future of stem cell therapy to treat the   disease. It’s not as easy as people originally thought it might be. “But these findings provide us with vital information that will help us look   at alternative ways of combating different forms of the disease, which will   ultimately allow patients to achieve long-term complete remission.”"
telegraph,16/01/2008 18:03,news,"Scientists have pinpointed the most virulent cells in melanoma skin cancer for destruction using a method that could be used to fight major cancers too.                                                      Sunshine - vitamin D and heart disease protection included                                              Many researches believe that almost every cancer contains small populations of highly dangerous cells - rogue stem cells - that can trigger a cancer and feed it because they create endless copies of themselves, and have started to look for ways to target these cells.          Now, for the first time, researchers at Children's Hospital Boston and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston have found a strategy that selectively targets these cancer stem cells for destruction, successfully halting the spread of one of the deadliest cancers - melanoma - in mice.          Although only three in every 100 cancers diagnosed are melanomas, the feat reported by Dr Markus Frank and colleagues in the journal Nature adds valuable support to the idea that stem cells may also drive the progression of other cancers where stem cells have been identified, such as breast, brain and colon cancers, where they could be targeted in treatments.          'Not every cell in a cancer are the same,' says Dr Frank. 'There is a population of cancer stem cells. But it has never been shown that targeting them can halt tumour growth. This is a very important study when it comes to validating this approach for future treatments.'          In terms of future drug development, Dr Frank said that he would expect to see the approach tested on patients within 'two to three years,' assuming the follow up work is as encouraging.          The team focused on the melanoma because it is a highly aggressive and difficult-to-treat form of skin cancer that is resistant to virtually all drugs and is deadly if it starts to spread through the body, called metastatis.          Dr Frank, with Dr George Murphy and Dr Tobias Schatton, isolated melanoma stem cells and found that they have, on their surface, a special protein that helps shuttle toxic agents out of the cell.          Earlier work at Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's showed this protein, known as ABCB5, makes melanoma cells resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Now ABCB5 is also linked with the progression of the disease, so it might become useful for doctors trying to assess the risk posed by a tumour.          The team took mice that were growing human tumour cells from melanoma patients, then injected the rodents with monoclonal antibodies - proteins designed only to bind with the ABCB5 protein and thus the melanoma stem cells.          They found that this stimulated an immune response that killed tumour cells and significantly inhibited melanoma growth as compared with untreated mice. 'Growth could be halted,' said Dr Frank. 'It is of course preliminary and it would be wrong to raise false hopes but many are trying to turn cancer stem cell targetting into therapy.'          'Hopefully, this will lead to new ways of treating metastatic disease, since our existing treatments don't work well,' adds Murphy.          The team is now doing studies aimed at eventually bringing this finding to the clinic, preparing human monoclonal antibodies to target ABCB5 and also trying to block melanoma stem cell genes using 'inhibitory RNA molecules.'"
dailymail,9/4/2015 22:34,sciencetech,"Scientists have sequenced whole genomes from mountain gorillas for the first time in a huge boost to conservation efforts for the endangered primates.The move will give scientists and conservationists new insight into the impact of population decline on these critically endangered apes.It allows them to compare the genome to other gorillas for the first time.Scroll down for video 'Mountain gorillas are among the most intensively studied primates in the wild, but this is the first in-depth, whole-genome analysis,' says Dr Chris Tyler-Smith, corresponding author from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. While mountain gorillas are extensively inbred and at risk of extinction, research published today in Science finds more to be optimistic about in their genomes than expected.'Three years on from sequencing the gorilla reference genome, we can now compare the genomes of all gorilla populations, including the critically endangered mountain gorilla, and begin to understand their similarities and differences, and the genetic impact of inbreeding.'The number of mountain gorillas living in the Virunga volcanic mountain range on the borders of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo plummeted to approximately 253 in 1981 as a result of habitat destruction and hunting. Since then, conservation efforts led by the Rwanda Development Board and conservation organizations like the Gorilla Doctors (a partnership between the non-profit Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project and the UC Davis Wildlife Health Center), and supported by tourists keen to see the gorillas made famous by late primatologist Dian Fossey, have bolstered numbers to approximately 480 among the Virunga population.Researchers interested to learn how such a small gene pool would affect the mountain gorillas were surprised to find that many harmful genetic variations had been removed from the population through inbreeding, and that mountain gorillas are genetically adapting to surviving in small populations.'This new understanding of genetic diversity and demographic history among gorilla populations provides us with valuable insight into how apes and humans, their closely related cousins, adapt genetically to living in small populations,' says Dr Aylwyn Scally, corresponding author from the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge.'In these data we can observe the process by which genomes are purged of severely deleterious mutations by a small population size.'Using blood samples collected over several years by the Rwanda Development Board, The Institut Congolese pour la Conservation du Nature and by Gorilla Doctors, which treats wild gorillas injured by snares, researchers were able to sequence the whole genomes of seven mountain gorillas for the first time. Previously, only easily obtainable but poor-quality DNA from faecal and hair samples have been analysed at a handful of genetic loci. Scientists could now see that these mountain gorillas, along with eastern lowland gorillas, their closely related neighbours, were two to three times less genetically diverse than gorillas from larger groups in western regions of central Africa.While there are concerns that this low level of genetic diversity may make the mountain gorillas more vulnerable to environmental change and to disease, including cross-infectious strains of human viruses, the inbreeding has, in some ways, been genetically beneficial, the team found.Fewer harmful loss-of-function variants were found in the mountain gorilla population than in the more numerous western gorilla populations.These variants stop genes from working and can cause serious, often fatal, health conditions.By analysing the variations in each genome, researchers also discovered that mountain gorillas have survived in small numbers for thousands of years. Using recently-developed methods, researchers were able to determine how the size of the population has changed over the past million years. According to their calculations, the average population of mountain gorillas has numbered in the hundreds for many thousands of years; far longer than previously thought.'We worried that the dramatic decline in the 1980s would be catastrophic for mountain gorillas in the long term, but our genetic analyses suggest that gorillas have been coping with small population sizes for thousands of years,' says Dr Yali Xue, first author from the Sanger Institute. 'While comparable levels of inbreeding contributed to the extinction of our relatives the Neanderthals, mountain gorillas may be more resilient. 'There is no reason why they should not flourish for thousands of years to come.'It is hoped that the detailed, whole-genome sequence data gathered through this research will aid conservation efforts. Now that a genome-wide map of genetic differences between populations is available, it will be possible to identify the origins of gorillas that have been illegally captured or killed. This will enable more gorillas to be returned to the wild and will make it easier to bring prosecutions against those who poach gorillas for souvenirs and bush meat.Dr Mike Cranfield, Co-Director of Gorilla Doctors, said: 'Detailed genetic data help us trace where confiscated gorillas came from, and allows the assessment of the genetic health of the population as well as their susceptibility to certain health issues.' "
telegraph,2/3/2002 0:01,news,"STUDIES of how to use human embryo cells to develop new treatments for a vast range of diseases, from Parkinson's to diabetes, began in earnest in Britain yesterday.The first licences were granted after a decision to extend the experiments allowed on early human embryos, consisting of about 100 cells, to include the creation of lines of stem cells, the master cells of every type in the body.Applications from the Centre for Genome Research in Edinburgh and from Guy's Hospital and King's College, London, were approved by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.'Britain could become the world leader of this field,' said Dr Stephen Minger, of King's College, an American member of the London team.This week a Lords committee agreed that stem cell research on embryos could be allowed in Britain, subject to tight controls.Neither of the two new projects will involve cell nuclear transfer - the cloning process used to produce Dolly the sheep in 1997. The clinics will only use 'surplus' embryos from IVF treatment, that would otherwise have been destroyed, with informed consent of the parents. The Centre for Genome Research is to establish stem cell lines to be deposited in a national stem cell bank that will go into operation next year. 'Research into stem cells is vital to evaluate their potential use in the development of new medical treatments for a range of degenerative and chronic diseases which are otherwise untreatable, or poorly treated,' said Prof Austin Smith, director.'Of particular interest are Parkinson's, stroke and cardiovascular diseases. We will use only embryos generated for infertility treatment. Such embryos are normally destroyed but, if the couple gives consent, may be used in research. 'The objectives of our research are to develop the best methods for cultivating stem cells and for directing them to make nerve, heart and blood cells.'Cell lines will also be deposited in the bank by Dr Sue Pickering and Prof Peter Braude at Guy's Hospital and King's College, who aim to find new treatments for infertility and miscarriages by studying the link between the health of the embryo and the ability to derive lines of embryonic stem cells.A second aspect of the project, under Dr Minger, will attempt to coax the embryonic cells to turn into nerve cells, for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, or pancreatic cells to treat diabetes.There was evidence already that transplants could treat these diseases, if only there was enough tissue, said Dr Minger. However, treatments were 'years away'.The HFEA said its licence committee gave 'careful consideration to the scientific, medical and ethical issues of the applications. The research will be subject to close monitoring and scrutiny'.ProLife Alliance, which has lost the legal and democratic battle to halt this research, said: 'We demand confirmation that the research aims identified by the licences could not properly be carried out in either animal embryo models or with adult stem cells.'Our animal-loving country might be concerned if we started to experiment on monkeys. If only such concern could be directed to the human species.'But Dr Minger said: 'You are never going to convince people opposed to this research that it has benefits for patients with debilitating diseases.' He stressed that the embryos would have otherwise been destroyed.'If they can be used in some meaningful way, I think that is OK.'"
telegraph,27/01/2001 00:00,news,"THE entire genetic formula for rice has been unravelled by scientists.The completion of the 'rice genome map', announced yesterday by the Torrey Mesa Research Institute, part of the company Syngenta, and Myriad Genetics Inc in America, is the first project of its kind in a crop plant.Because rice - which is the staple food for more than half the world's population - is a model for other cereals, the breakthrough will accelerate the development of genetically modified crops. It will also add fuel to the debate over GM foods and whether First World fears have obscured the technology's benefits for the Third World.Rice plants have approximately 50,000 different genes, which are written in about 430 million 'letters' of DNA, so the achievement marks the second largest genome to be sequenced to date, after that of humans.The information will be used by plant breeders to select the best progeny from creating cross-varieties of rice within five years, while biotechnologists will use it to identify and transfer individual genes from one rice variety to another so that GM rice can be made within about seven years.Because of the similarity between different cereal crop plants, the work will contribute to the study of other important cereals such as wheat, corn, and barley, and lead to new varieties. Dr Steve Briggs, president of TMRI, said: 'We are very proud that our institute has pioneered this research.'Identifying not only the genes, but their functions and how they work, will provide researchers with crucial new knowledge to improve food crops.' Rice has been grown as food for more than 5,000 years and is consumed by three billion people each day. Rice growing uses large volumes of water and, compared with similar crops, is inefficient. It is also vulnerable to drought.The dependency of so many people on rice as their staple food makes it crucial that production does not falter. The introduction of new rice varieties over the past 30 years has succeeded in doubling production. However, in Asia alone, the demand for rice is expected to increase by 70 per cent over the next 30 years.Current methods of plant breeding will only be able to increase rice production to meet part of this demand, as land, labour and water become significant limiting factors. Scientists believe that knowing the rice genome will aid efforts to improve yields and increase the crop's resilience.Dr David Evans, head of research and technology at Syngenta, said: 'Understanding cereal genetic structure and associated proteins will enable plant breeders to produce crops that are more nutritious, more productive and easier to process. We will also research new ways to protect crops from diseases or pests, and discover new uses for crop plants. This offers exciting new opportunities to improve agricultural yields and quality.'Syngenta said it will work with research institutes in the developing world to explore how its research can best be used to improve crops and benefit subsistence farmers. A spokesman said: 'It is our policy to provide such information and technology for use in products for subsistence farmers, without royalties or technology fees.'One example of the type of benefits that the research will bring is the development of a genetically modified golden rice variety that is rich in vitamin A. About 124 million children do not get enough vitamin A in their diets and it is a leading cause of blindness. It also causes up to a million deaths a year in developing countries.Prof Ingo Potrykus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology has added three genes to rice plants, two from the daffodil and one from a bacterium, to produce rice plants that make enough beta-carotene - converted to vitamin A by the body - to meet the total vitamin A requirement through a typical Asian diet.The rice genome sequence is the most accurate and comprehensive large genome with direct commercial value to be sequenced so far. The rice genome map is better than 99.5 per cent complete, compared with the human genome map, which still contains a number of large gaps and is estimated to be approximately 90 to 95 per cent complete.A public consortium, the International Rice Genome Sequencing project, aims to produce a more detailed genetic sequence by 2005."
telegraph,24/09/2008 18:00,news,"The next US president will have a vital role in determining how the US, and the world, responds to climate change.                                                      US Election 2008 full coverage                                             To find out where Republicans and Democrats stand Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain were invited by Nature magazine to answer a range of questions on science, energy and climate change.         Mr Obama responded to 18 questions but the McCain camp declined to take part.         Mr Obama's answers to many of the questions are printed here; answers to additional questions (on topics including biosecurity, the nuclear weapons laboratories and US participation in international projects) can be found at                www.nature.com/uselection            .         Wherever possible, Nature noted what Mr McCain has said at other times on these topics.                     What will be your highest priority in the science and technology arena?                  Barack Obama:         I am committed to strengthening US leadership in science, technology and innovation, and doing so will be a central priority for my administration. Our talent for innovation is still the envy of the world, but we face unprecedented challenges that demand new approaches.         For example, the United States annually imports $53 billion more in advanced technology products than we export. China is now the world's number one high-technology exporter.          This competitive situation may only worsen over time because the number of US students pursuing technical careers is declining.         The United States ranks 17th among developed nations in the proportion of college students receiving degrees in science or engineering; we were in third place 30 years ago.         Federally supported basic research, aimed at understanding many features of nature - from the size of the Universe to subatomic particles, from the chemical reactions that support a living cell to interactions that sustain ecosystems - has been an essential feature of American life for over 50 years.         While the outcomes of specific projects are never predictable, basic research has been a reliable source of new knowledge that has fuelled important developments in fields ranging from telecommunications to medicine, yielding remarkable rates of economic return and ensuring American leadership in industry, military power and higher education.          I believe that continued investment in fundamental research is essential for ensuring healthier lives, better sources of energy, superior military capacity, and high wage jobs for our nation's future.         Yet, today, we are clearly under-investing in research across the spectrum of scientific and engineering disciplines. Federal support for the physical sciences and engineering has been declining as a fraction of gross domestic product for decades, and, after a period of growth of the life sciences, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget has been steadily losing buying power for the past six years.         As a result, our science agencies are often able to support no more than one in 10 proposals that they receive, arresting the careers of our young scientists and blocking our ability to pursue many remarkable recent advances. Furthermore, in this environment, scientists are less likely to pursue the risky research that may lead to the most important breakthroughs.         Finally, we are reducing support for science at a time when many other nations are increasing it, a situation that already threatens our leadership in many critical areas of science.         This situation is unacceptable. As president, I will increase funding for basic research in physical and life sciences, mathematics and engineering at a rate that would double basic research budgets over the next decade to support our scientists and restore US scientific leadership.         John McCain has similarly promised to fight for increased funding at some of the country's leading science agencies, but without specific targets in terms of dollars or time frames.         'Under a McCain administration, science and research will have a very high priority,' says Jay Khosla, who advises the campaign on health policy issues.         'He will do everything it takes to ensure we will continue to be leaders, especially in the field of innovation.'         One potentially major stumbling block to those looking for more research funding: Mr McCain has said he would freeze domestic discretionary spending, which includes science money, for one year if elected in order to help trim overall spending levels.         In general, Mr McCain has stressed less government control and more business - and technology oriented approaches to spurring innovation, such as a $300 million prize for advanced battery technology.         On the campaign trail he touches on many of the same themes as Mr Obama, such as the perceived need to educate more American scientists and engineers; Mr McCain would, for instance, provide bonuses for high performing teachers in subjects such as maths and science, and support education programmes at science agencies such as the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.         Biomedical innovation is expensive and very slow; it takes $1 billion and the better part of a decade to develop a new drug.                     What would your administration do to make it easier to turn research into cures?                  Mr Obama:         Americans have good reasons to be proud of the extraordinary role that medical science has had in combating disease, here and throughout the world, over the past century.         Work sponsored by the NIH, other government agencies and our pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries has produced many vaccines, drugs and hormones that have improved the quality of life, extended life expectancy and reduced the dire consequences of many serious illnesses and disabilities.         While it may never be easy to 'turn research into cures', I understand that biomedical scientists are seeing enhanced opportunities to use their science to improve health. I will encourage the development of biological markers of disease that might simplify the evaluation of new therapies, the use of genetic information to select patients most likely to benefit from new treatments, and the multi-disciplinary efforts that are now possible at many research centres. In addition, I will support increased attention to research that focuses on prevention, mearly detection and improved management of disease.         Furthermore, I believe there is more that we can do to ensure new treatments are developed and made available to the public more efficiently. I believe that we must increase funding for the NIH to reverse the funding trends that have left our nation's scientists with fewer resources as research costs escalate.         We must also do a better job of providing resources to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other federal agencies that help ensure that when these medical advances are turned into exciting new treatments, we are able to ensure that they are swiftly and safely considered for widespread usage.          Additionally, we must prioritise removing barriers both between federal agencies and across public, private and nonprofit organisations to ensure better and more efficient collaboration on new innovations.         Mr McCain has also said he would strongly support funding for the NIH.         'McCain wants to make sure we are doing everything possible to give the young scientists of today the resources they need to go out and bring research to cures,' says Mr Khosla.         The health-care platforms of both candidates tend to focus on how to make health insurance more affordable and accessible to Americans, and Mr McCain has talked about technologies that could benefit public health - such as telemedicine - to bring the latest medical knowledge to many more patients.         Many scientists are bitter about what they see as years of political interference in scientific decisions at federal agencies.                     What would you do to help restore impartial scientific advice in government?                  Mr Obama:         Scientific and technological information is of growing importance to a range of issues. I believe such information must be expert and uncoloured by ideology. I will restore the basic principle that government decisions should be based on the best-available, scientifically valid evidence and not on the ideological predispositions of agency officials or political appointees.         More broadly, I am committed to creating a transparent and connected democracy, using cutting edge technologies to provide a new level of transparency, accountability and participation for America's citizens. Policies must be determined using a process that builds on the long tradition of open debate that has characterised progress in science, including review by individuals who might bring new information or contrasting views.         I have already established an impressive team of science advisers, including several Nobel laureates, who are helping me to shape a robust science agenda for my administration.         In addition I will:         • Appoint individuals with strong science and technology backgrounds and reputations for integrity and objectivity to the growing number of senior management positions in which decisions must incorporate science and technology advice. These positions will be filled promptly with ethical, highly qualified individuals on a non-partisan basis;         • Establish the nation's first Chief Technology Officer (CTO) to ensure that our government and all its agencies have the right infrastructure, policies and services for the twenty-first century.         The CTO will lead an inter-agency effort on best-in-class technologies, sharing of best practices and safeguarding of our networks;         • Strengthen the role of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) by appointing experts who are charged to provide independent advice on critical issues in science and technology. The PCAST will once again be advisory to the president.         • Restore the science integrity of government and restore transparency of decision-making by issuing an Executive Order establishing clear guidelines for the review and release of government publications, guaranteeing that results are released in a timely manner and not distorted by the ideological biases of political appointees. I will strengthen protection for 'whistle blowers' who report abuses of these processes.         Mr McCain has similarly pledged to fill key technical positions in his administration with qualified scientists and engineers, including having a science adviser working directly with the president.          'McCain will seek to restore the credibility of scientific research' in the federal government, says campaign adviser Floyd Des-Champs. Mr McCain has argued that taxpayers' investment in scientific research should be repaid with the untarnished results of that work.                     What role does nuclear power have in your vision for the US energy supply, and how would you address the problem of nuclear waste?                  Mr Obama: Nuclear power represents an important part of our current energy mix. Nuclear also represents 70 per cent of our non-carbon generated electricity. It is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option.         However, before an expansion of nuclear power is considered, key issues must be addressed, including security of nuclear fuel and waste, waste storage and proliferation. The nuclear waste disposal efforts at Yucca Mountain [in Nevada] have been an expensive failure and should be abandoned.         I will work with the industry and governors to develop a way to store nuclear waste safely while we pursue long-term solutions.         Mr McCain has proposed building 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030, with an eventual goal of a total of 100. Mr McCain has not addressed where the nuclear waste from these and current reactors would go, and he has supported the Yucca Mountain storage project in the past.                     You support a cap-and-trade system for regulating greenhouse-gas emissions; what lessons from the European emissions-trading system would you implement?                  Mr Obama: I will implement a market-based cap and trade system to reduce carbon emissions by the amount scientists say is necessary: 80 per cent  below 1990 levels by 2050. While Europe has had important successes with its system, it also has made mistakes that we should learn from.          Unlike the European system, my plan would aim to cover virtually all greenhouse-gas emissions, would auction off all of the permits instead of giving them away, and would make sure there was stability in the market for permits and their price.         My plan would use the proceeds of the auction for investments in a clean-energy future, habitat protection and rebates and other transition relief for families.         Mr McCain has described his own vision of a cap-and-trade system, but with a different target; the McCain plan calls for reductions of emissions by 60 per cent below 1990 levels by 2050.         Mr McCain would initially give away emissions permits instead of auctioning them. He would also allow emissions allowances to be 'banked' or 'borrowed' for different time periods, as well as establish a national 'strategic carbon reserve' that could release permits during difficult economic times. He would also allow unlimited offsets, from both domestic and international sources, to ease into a newly set up cap-andtrade system.                     Does your stance on tapping domestic oil reserves stand at odds with your goals for reducing national emissions and combating climate change? How will you balance the two?                  Mr Obama:          With 3 per cent of the world's oil reserves, the United States cannot drill its way to energy security. But US oil and gas production plays an important role in our domestic economy and remains critical to prevent global energy prices from climbing even higher.         There are several key opportunities to support increased US production of oil and gas that do not require opening up currently protected areas.         Increasing domestic oil and gas production in the ways I propose in no way lessens my commitment to combating climate change, one of the great challenges of our time. I am committed to implementing a market-based cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions 80 per cent below 1990 levels by 2050, and I will start reducing emissions immediately by establishing strong annual reduction targets with an intermediate goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.         Mr McCain currently favours a more aggressive offshore-drilling policy than Mr Obama; both candidates, like the Democratic-led Congress, have changed their earlier stances opposing such drilling in the face of rising oil prices and public pressure to do something about it. However, Mr McCain sees climate change as a national security issue, and maintains that it is a major priority for him. He emphasises developing new emissions-reducing technologies with minimum costs in order to soften any blow to the national economy. Mr  McCain's intermediate goal for emission reductions is also 1990 levels by 2020.                     Do you believe that evolution by means of natural selection is a sufficient explanation for the variety and complexity of life on Earth? Should intelligent design, or some derivative thereof, be taught in science class in public schools?                  Mr Obama:          I believe in evolution, and I support the strong consensus of the scientific community that evolution is scientifically validated.         I do not believe it is helpful to our students to cloud discussions of science with non-scientific theories like intelligent design that are not subject to experimental scrutiny.         Mr McCain said last year, in a Republican primary debate: 'I believe in evolution. But I also believe, when I hike the Grand Canyon and see it at sunset, that the hand of God is there also.'         In 2005, he told the Arizona Daily Star that he thought 'all points of view' should be available to students studying the origins of humanity. But the next year a Colorado paper reported him saying that such viewpoints should not be taught in science class.                     Would you lift President Bush's ban on federal funding for research on human embryonic stem-cell lines derived after 9 August 2001?                              Under what conditions do you find it acceptable to create a human embryonic stem-cell line?                  Mr Obama: Stem-cell research holds the promise of improving our lives in at least three ways - by substituting normal cells for damaged cells to treat diabetes, Parkinson's disease, spinal-cord injury, heart failure and other disorders; by providing scientists with safe and convenient models of disease for drug development; and by helping to understand fundamental aspects of normal development and cell dysfunction.         For these reasons, I strongly support expanding research on stem cells. I believe that the restrictions that President Bush has placed on the funding of human embryonic stem-cell research have handcuffed our scientists and hindered our ability to compete with other nations.         As president, I will lift the current administration's ban on federal funding of research on embryonic stem-cell lines created after 9 August 2001 through executive order, and I will ensure that all research on stem cells is conducted ethically and with rigorous oversight.         I recognise that some people object to government support of research that requires cells to be harvested from human embryos. However, hundreds of thousands of embryos stored in the United States in in vitro fertilisation clinics will not be used for reproductive purposes, and will eventually be destroyed.          I believe that it is ethical to use these extra embryos for research that could save lives when they are freely donated for that express purpose.         I am also aware that there have been suggestions that human stem cells of various types, derived from sources other than embryos, make the use of embryonic stem cells unnecessary. I don't agree. While adult stem cells, such as those harvested from blood or bone marrow, are already used for treatment of some diseases, they do not have the versatility of embryonic stem cells and cannot replace them.         Recent discoveries indicate that adult skin cells can be reprogrammed to behave like stem cells; these are exciting findings that might in the future lead to an alternate source of highly versatile stem cells. However, embryonic stem cells remain the 'gold standard', and studies of all types of stem cells should continue in parallel for the foreseeable future.         Rather than restrict the funding of such research, I favour responsible oversight of it, in accordance with recent reports from the National Research Council (NRC). Recommendations from the NRC reports are already being followed by institutions that conduct human embryonic stem-cell research with funds from a variety of sources.         An expanded, federally supported stem-cell research programme will encourage talented US scientists to engage in this important new field, will allow more effective oversight, and will signal to other countries our commitment to compete in this exciting area of medical research.         Mr McCain's stance on embryonic stem-cell research has been the subject of much speculation among researchers. He has voted twice before to lift President Bush's funding restrictions on such work, but his running mate Sarah Palin opposes the work.         His public position is perhaps best summarized in his response to questionnaires from advocacy groups such as Research!America last year and ScienceDebate2008 this year: 'While I support federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research, I believe clear lines should be drawn that reflect a refusal to sacrifice moral values and ethicalprinciples for the sake of scientific progress.         'Moreover, I believe that recent scientific breakthroughs raise the hope that one day this debate will be rendered academic. I also support funding for other research programmes, including amniotic fluid and adult stem-cell research which hold much scientific promise and do not involve the use of embryos.          'I oppose the intentional creation of human embryos for research purposes and I voted to ban the practice of 'fetal farming', making it a federal crime for researchers to use cells or fetal tissue from an embryo created for research purposes.'                     Do you see astronauts on the Moon as a worthy goal for the country?                  Mr Obama:         I believe that the United States needs a strong space programme to help maintain its superiority not only in space, but also here on earth in the realms of education, science, technology, the environment and national security. Technology developed for space missions has been applied to improve everything from computers and medical technology to baby formula and automobiles.         As president, I will establish a robust and balanced civilian space programme. In achieving this vision, I will reach out to include international partners and to engage the private sector to amplify Nasa's reach. I believe that a revitalized Nasa can help America maintain its innovation edge and contribute to American economic growth.         I will re-establish the National Aeronautics and Space Council, which will coordinate civilian, military, commercial and national security space activities and report to the president.         This council will oversee a comprehensive and integrated strategy and policy dealing with all aspects of the government's space-related programmes, including those being managed by Nasa, the Department of Defence, the National Reconnaissance Office, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation and other federal agencies.         It will solicit public participation, engage the international community and work toward a twenty-first-century vision of space that constantly pushes the envelope on new technologies as it pursues a balanced national portfolio that expands our reach into the heavens and improves life here on Earth.         Human spaceflight is important to America's political, economic, technological and scientific leadership. I will support renewed human exploration beyond low Earth orbit. I endorse the goal of sending human missions to the Moon by 2020, as a precursor in an orderly progression to missions to more distant destinations,including Mars.         Mr McCain has released an extensive space platform, including calling space exploration a 'top priority' for the country and manned space flight 'a reflection of national power and pride'.         Unlike Mr Obama, Mr McCain has explicitly committed to funding the Constellation programme to replace the space-shuttle fleet (although without details on how he would accomplish that). He also says he would maintain the nation's space infrastructure, including the related workforce, and focus on maximising the research possibilities of the International Space Station. He would maintain investments in aeronautics research as well as the infrastructure for Earth-monitoring satellites.                     Would it make sense for more overseas students who receive PhDs at American universities to stay in the country and contribute to its research base and its wealth? What immigration reforms would you support?                  Mr Obama:          I believe that we must enact comprehensive immigration reform to restore our economic strength, relieve local governments of unfair burdens stemming from an inefficient federal immigration system, ensure that our country and borders remain secure and allow a path to citizenship for the 12 million undocumented immigrants who are willing to pay a fine, pay taxes, and learn English.         A critical part of comprehensive immigration reform is turning back misguided policies that since 9/11 have turned away the world's best and brightest from America. As president, I will improve our legal permanent resident visa programmes and temporary programmes to attract some of the world's most talented people to America.         Mr McCain, as a senator from Arizona, has long been involved in immigration issues, mainly through strengthening federal security at land border crossings. He supports immigration reforms to allow more highly skilled workers to stay and work in the United States after graduation.                     Reporting by Alexandra Witze         "
telegraph,8/10/2007 13:00,news,"The Nobel prize for medicine is shared today by Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies for their work on stem cells and genetic manipulation that has had a profound impact, from basic medical research to the development of new treatments.                                                      Have your say: Congratulate Britain's Nobel prize winners                                              Although stem cells are one of the hottest fields in science today for their potential for growing replacement cells and tissue for a wide range of diseases, the prestigious 10 million Swedish crown (£750,000) prize recognised the international team's work for genetically manipulating stem cells to find out what genes do in the body and to provide animal versions of human disease to help hone understanding and test new treatments.          Capecchi was born in Italy and is a US citizen. Both Evans and Smithies are British-born. Sir Martin is known for his pioneering work on stem cells in mice, while Capecci and Smithies showed how genes could be modified.             Overall, their work meant they could use stem cells as a way to genetically manipulate mice in a highly specific way, leading to lab rodents that replicate human disease, the Nobel jury said in its citation. The discovery is technically called gene targeting but is commonly known as gene 'knockout.'             In particular, they showed how to knock out genes in mice, shedding light on what genes do and providing a test bed for biomedical research. Their 'ground-breaking discoveries concerning embryonic stem cells and DNA recombination in mammals... led to the creation of an immensely powerful technology,' the committee said.          'Gene targeting in mice has pervaded all fields of biomedicine. Its impact on the understanding of gene function and its benefits to mankind will continue to increase over many years to come,' it said.          To date more than 10,000 mice genes - approximately half of the genes in the mammalian genome - have been knocked out.          Capecchi, born in 1937, is a human genetics and biology professor at the University of Utah, while Smithies is a professor of pathology at the University of North Carolina. Sir Martin, born in 1941, is the director of the School of Biosciences and professor of mammalian genetics at Cardiff University.          Sir Martin's work has helped in studying cystic fibrosis and in testing the effects of gene therapy, where genes are transplanted to treat disease. Smithies also worked on gene targeting for cystic fibrosis and the blood disease thalassaemia as well as hypertension and atherosclerosis, the process that clogs arteries.          'This is very welcome news to all geneticists around the world,' said Professor Steve Brown, Director of the Medical Research Council Mammalian Genetics Unit. He said the timing was right, given that scientists now have the human and mouse genetic codes. There is now an effort to knock out each gene in turn in the mouse to see how genes work and how they cause disease.          Professor Stephen O'Rahilly, Head of the Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, said: 'The development of gene targeting technology in the mouse has had a profound influence on medical research.         'Thanks to this technology we have a much better understanding of the function of specific genes in pathways in the whole organism and a greater ability to predict whether drugs acting on those pathways are likely to have beneficial effects in disease.'          Dr Bill Colledge, University of Cambridge, who worked in Prof Martin Evans' lab from 1988 to 1995, said: 'This award is an acknowledgment of the outstanding contribution that Martin Evans played in developing the technology that allows us to study the function of genes in a whole animal.'          Lord Rees, President of the Royal Society, said: 'This is a fitting recognition of Sir Martin's ground-breaking research on embryonic stem cells. He is a world leader in mammalian genetics and his research has undoubtedly increased our understanding of human diseases.         'Stem cell research has immense potential. It is a field to where UK scientists such as Martin, have made pioneering contributions and maintain a powerful presence.'"
telegraph,21/04/2015 18:38,news,"The pioneering therapy offers hope to the hundreds thousands of people suffering from inherited conditions  British doctors have cured youngsters of a deadly inherited disorder using a ground-breaking stem cell treatment which heralds a new dawn for genetic therapies.  Patients with the most severe form of the rare blood condition Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome have now been free of the disease for four years.  Although the disorder affects fewer than one hundred children in Britain, the pioneering therapy offers hope to the hundreds thousands of people suffering from other genetic blood conditions such as sickle cell anaemia.  Daniel Wheeler, 15, of Bristol was among seven children who have been trialling the new gene therapy at centres in London and Paris.  Daniel was diagnosed with the condition aged two and had needed frequent medical care to manage his symptoms which included severe eczema, asthma and inability to fight infections. His older brother died from complications linked to the disease.  But since undergoing gene therapy in 2011 Daniel has shown no symptoms and doctors believe he is effectively cured.  Daniel’s mother Sarah, 50, a letting’s consultant from Bristol said: “Since being around two, Daniel has been in an out of hospital, but now his skin has cleared up and so has his asthma. It means he can get on with his life now.”     Gene therapy heralds cure for blindness    Adrian Thrasher, Professor in Paediatric Immunology, at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, where the treatment was carried out, said that it offered new hope for people suffering from incurable disease.  “We are entering a new era where genetic treatments are entering mainstream medicine and offering hope to patients for whom conventional treatments don’t work well or are simply unavailable,” he said.  “The work shows that this method is successful in patients who, in the past would have very little chance of survival without a well match bone marrow donor.  “It also excitingly demonstrates the potential for treatment of a large number of other diseases for which existing therapies are either unsatisfactory or unavailable.'  The treatment works by removing bone marrow stem cells – the type of cells which create new blood cells – and replacing the faulty part of the genetic code with a healthy gene. When the stem cells are replaced in the patient they then begin producing healthy blood cells, free from disease.     Heart attack damage repaired using gene therapy   Seven children between the ages of eight months and 15 years were chosen because a bone marrow match could not be found. Without bone marrow transplantation, patients usually do not survive their teens.  All the children had eczema and associated recurrent infections and most experienced severe bleeding and autoimmune disease that, in one case, confined the child to a wheelchair.  The children went from spending an average of 25 days in hospital to no days in the hospital in the two years after the treatment. And the child using the wheelchair was able to walk again.  Fulvio Mavilio, Chief Scientific Officer at Genethon, the biotech company which developed the treatment said: “It is the first time that a gene therapy based on genetically modified stem cells is tested in an international clinical trial that shows a reproducible and robust therapeutic effect in different centres and different countries.”     Cystic fibrosis sufferers offered hope with gene therapy    The research was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

telegraph,24/12/2005 00:01,news,"The world's most successful cloning scientist, Prof Hwang Woo-suk, who was hailed as a superstar with 'God's hand' in his native South Korea, has resigned in disgrace.          The furore that erupted yesterday over how his team partly faked results will send shock waves around the scientific world, damage the image of biotechnology and cast a shadow over rival British efforts to develop the next generation of medicine.                                        Hwang made headlines last year when he unveiled the first cloned human embryo. This year he published an apparent tour de force, reporting the creation of more than 30 cloned human embryos and 11 lines of stem cells which could be grown into any of the 200 cell types found in the body.          The work marked the start of what many scientists believed would be a revolution, with stem cells being grown from patients to treat a vast range of diseases.          Pro-life groups condemned the research as 'repugnant manipulation' and 'trivialisation' of a human life.          Only a few days ago Hwang was forced to admit that he had lied about using eggs donated by his female staff for his experiments. Yesterday he apologised, stripped himself of his professorship and resigned from Seoul National University, the country's leading educational institution, after an expert committee announced the initial findings of an inquiry.          Hwang's team is alleged to have fabricated at least nine of his 11 stem cell lines, manipulating photographs and concocting DNA tests.          'This is a grave act that damages the foundation of science,' the panel said.          As Hwang left his office, he told reporters: 'I sincerely apologise to the people for creating shock and disappointment. With an apologetic heart. . . I step down as professor.' But he maintained that his laboratory could do what it had claimed. 'I emphasise that patient-specific stem cells belong to South Korea and you are going to see this,' he said.                                        Hwang was highly respected and many other scientists, including some from Britain, had visited his laboratory and returned impressed.          A team in Newcastle upon Tyne was the first in the West to clone a human embryo for stem cell work. The revelations from South Korea could put Britain ahead of the world, given the restrictions on cloning research in America, where President George W Bush has said: 'I worry about a world in which cloning becomes accepted.'          But there could be fallout. Prof Ian Wilmut, of Edinburgh University, the creator of Dolly the sheep, has been collaborating with Hwang's team on motor neurone disease and that venture must now be in doubt.          Prof Alan Trounson, of Monash University, Melbourne, said the reaction could stain other scientists linked to Hwang's work.          The news also provides a platform for pro-life groups, which questioned the cloning of a human embryo at the Centre for Life, in Newcastle.          Comment on Reproductive Ethics (Core) said: 'Given Tony Blair's enthusiasm for investing huge sums in stem cell research [£100 million over the next two years], the UK should be one of the first to reassess the hype surrounding human cloning.'          Core said the Newcastle team had been reproached by the journal Nature, which complained that the 'premature release of this incomplete information, without any form of peer review and without making it clear to journalists that the work had not been refereed, is contrary to good scientific practice'.          The head of the team, Prof Alison Murdoch, said the data had been published and were open to scrutiny. She stressed that British regulations and control were tight. The promise of cloning and stem cells remained the same, she added, although the Hwang affair 'has set us all back'.         The expert panel is now investigating Hwang's two other stem cell lines and his paper in the journal Science last year describing the world's first human cloned embryo. Another apparent milestone was Snuppy, the first cloned dog, which was reported in Nature. Both journals have launched inquiries.          The South Korean government, which had granted £23 million for Hwang's research, said it was 'miserable' at the news and would launch an inquiry. It had heaped honours on Hwang, including the commissioning of stamps showing a disabled man rising from his wheelchair as a result of the professor's work.          Choi Seong-sik, the vice-minister of science and technology, said the government was considering withdrawing Hwang's official title of 'Top Scientist'.          Prof Chang Ho-wan, the chairman of the Seoul National University council of professors, said: 'The university must dismiss Hwang and others involved and expel them from the academic world for ever.'          As for the wider impact, Prof Peter Andrews, of Sheffield University, said that about 100 lines of stem cells had been derived from surplus IVF embryos.          'Even if we could never clone a human embryo, there remain huge opportunities for biology and regenerative medicine from studies of stem cells derived directly from IVF embryos.'"
telegraph,12/6/2012 10:30,news,"There are important lessons to be learnt from the rush to develop stem-cell treatments for heart disease, says Roger Highfield.It can be a long way from the laboratory to the hospital. Elegant, targeted   anti-cancer therapies took decades to emerge after President Nixon declared   his “war on cancer” in 1971. Gene transplants are only now beginning to be   successful, after the first trial in 1990. The human genome, unveiled in   2000, generated a deluge of data but has had little impact so far on   medicine.Now there’s another story that sheds some light on why treatments can lag   years behind the hype. The story concerns stem cells, the “all-purpose”,   undifferentiated cells that can be harvested (controversially) from embryos   or (less controversially) from adults to be grown into replacement tissue.The hope was that stem-cell therapy could be used to treat heart disease,   which claimed the lives of 17 million people worldwide last year. Only there   is a disturbing twist to the tale. Despite an investment of billions of   pounds in research, it seems that these new treatments may rely as much on   faith as science.The details emerged at the recent opening of the £60 million Scottish Centre   for Regenerative Medicine in Edinburgh (SCRM), chaired by Sir Ian Wilmut,   whose cloning of Dolly the sheep provided one way to grow stem cells. In a   talk at the opening ceremony, Christine Mummery of the Leiden University   Medical Centre in the Netherlands described how there was a “rush to the   clinic” when an American team claimed in 2001, on the basis of experiments   in mice, that bone-marrow cells could mend a heart damaged by coronary   disease.Since the development of the heart transplant, cardiologists have garnered a   reputation for being gung-ho. This was no different. Without anything in the   way of systematic research in animals, the first patients were treated the   next year. Scientists usually damn with faint praise – but in this case,   Prof Mummery went so far as to say that the paper that launched the stampede   was “completely wrong”, and was overturned in follow-up studies. Yet the   2001 paper has never been withdrawn.A few years ago, concerns over these heart trials were voiced by a Norwegian   professor, Harald Arnesen. He concluded in 2007 that they “are not   convincing” and that one German team had achieved striking results only   because the control group in its trial had done particularly badly. Prof   Arnesen called for a moratorium on this kind of stem-cell therapy.That still did not deter the clinicians. This January, another trial funded by   the EU was announced – the largest of all, with 3,000 heart-attack patients   recruited from across Europe.The idea behind the trials is straightforward. During a heart attack, a   clogged blood vessel starves heart muscle of oxygen. Up to a billion heart   muscle cells, called cardiomyocytes, can be damaged, and the body responds   by replacing them with relatively inflexible scar tissue, which can lead to   fatal heart failure. So why not implant stem cells that can grow into   cardiomyocytes?Stem cells, of course, come in many kinds: the embryonic variety have the   potential to turn into all 200 cell types in the body. Adult stem cells,   harvested from the patient, have a more limited repertoire: bone marrow stem   cells generate blood cells, for example. So to claim, as was done in 2001,   these bone marrow stem cells could turn into heart muscle was both   surprising and exciting.Analysis shows that, at best, the amount of blood pumped during a contraction   of one heart chamber rose by 5 per cent after treatment. In a patient where   heart efficiency has fallen to 30 per cent of normal, that could be   significant – but it is relatively meagre, none the less. And it turns out   that this level of improvement results whatever the cells injected into the   damaged muscle – even if they have no prospect of forming cardiomyoctes.Even the believers in the technique now agree that implanted cells exert a   “paracrine action”, triggering a helpful inflammatory response or secreting   chemicals that boost blood vessel formation. But we’re still waiting for   convincing evidence that a patient’s lost heart muscle cells can be replaced.Embryonic stem cells offer one route to that goal, though it is difficult to   turn them into the right cell type reliably, and there are other risks, such   as uncontrolled growths. Another option has come from work by Prof Richard   Lee at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, who has found that some adult stem   cells can recruit other stem cells already in the heart to become   cardiomyocytes.Meanwhile, other fields of medicine that have seen more systematic research on   stem cells are making real progress in using them – for example, to treat   Parkinson’s, diabetes and macular degeneration. The lesson here is that,   ultimately, it takes careful experiments, not belief, to make that huge leap   from the laboratory to the hospital.Roger Highfield is director of external affairs at the Science Museum Group"
telegraph,23/07/2003 00:01,news,"   Experts worry what impact the Government's White Paper on genetics can have if it's not matched with money. Katrina Lythgoe reports   When it unveiled its White Paper on genetics, the Government said that the NHS should use the new knowledge to the benefit of all patients, and that Britain should lead the world in genetics research and development. Today, we reveal the verdict of the genetics community: the paper marks a step in the right direction but they will need more money if it's to have an impact.This snapshot of their opinion has come from an exclusive poll commissioned by The Daily Telegraph, conducted with the help of Government adviser Prof John Burn and the British Society for Human Genetics . From a diverse range of fields and laboratories, 73 experts gave us their opinion on the extra £50 million the Government will spend. Nine out of every 10 polled had reservations about whether the additional investment would allow Britain to keep up with the rest of the world in the area of gene therapy. A quarter categorically said that we would fall behind.The Government has said that it will invest an additional £3 million in gene therapy for the 4,000 single-gene disorders, and a further £2.5 million for cystic fibrosis, the most common of them. It has also allocated £4 million to pay for the vectors - viruses and other means to carry healthy genes into patients' bodies - that make gene therapy possible.These amounts may sound like a fortune to the parents of a child suffering from a genetic disorder, but genetics research is not cheap. This amount of funding is a 'drop in the ocean', as one expert put it. 'Peanuts compared to charity work recently funded,' said another senior geneticist. 'This will make no difference.'To put these figures in perspective, consider the cost of gene therapy trials for the 'bubble babies' who have X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, X-SCID, which strips the body of the ability to fight infection. Developing gene therapy to fight this disease cost Great Ormond Street children's hospital £1 million, and it costs £100,000 to treat a single child. The hospital will receive some extra funding from the Government but will still rely heavily on charities. 'Amounts like £3 million for gene therapy and £2.5 million for cystic fibrosis are almost insignificant on a national level,' said Dr Stephen Hart, a molecular immunologist at the Institute of Child Health. Not everyone agrees. Many experts questioned whether more money should be put into gene therapy at all. 'In terms of progress towards treating genetic disease,' said one, 'I don't believe gene therapy is the most cost-effective area to target resources.'Although gene therapy has been a fashionable topic for a decade, success has been limited. The Great Ormond Street team is one of only three worldwide to have reported unambiguous positive results, and there are concerns about side effects. 'I am sceptical about gene therapy as research has been ongoing for many years with very little success,' said one molecular geneticist. 'I am concerned that the hopes of families with single-gene disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, are raised with the increased publicity of a 'cure'.'The second controversial issue concerns the NHS's ability to diagnose those who have faulty genes. As Professor John Burn, director of the Northern Genetics Knowledge Park, mentions in his accompanying article, the Government has set impressive targets for the testing of genetic disease. But more than eight out of 10 of our experts said they had reservations that the targets could be met. 'The target for identifying unknown mutations in genes seems unrealistic,' said one. 'This paper will fuel unrealistic patient expectation with no prospect of delivery by an already overstretched laboratory workforce,' another senior geneticist added. And therein lies the problem. You can pump all the money you like into new buildings and new equipment, but if there are not enough people processing the tests they will not be able to cope. The Government has allocated money to train 90 new laboratory scientists in recognition of this. What many of our experts wonder, however, is who will train them?'There is an acute problem with shortages of trained staff, to the point that there is limited capacity for existing staff to train new individuals even if the promised funding becomes available,' said one. A consultant clinical geneticist added: 'The real problem is in staff retention in the labs and that can only be addressed by improving pay.' The trouble is, improving pay for laboratory technicians is not going to do much to improve the Government's profile.Despite their reservations, most experts welcomed the White Paper - if only because it will put genetics in the spotlight, giving hope for better funding in the future. 'Clearly it demonstrates a raised profile for genetics, at least until the next hot topic comes along,' one geneticist replied.'The UK is ahead of the United States and the rest of the world in many areas of genetic science and its clinical application,' said Prof David Porteous, head of medical genetics at the University of Edinburgh. 'This is despite relatively low investment in basic science and a dreadful record on biotech investment. The Government investment is fully justified, but only sufficient to make modest changes in UK effectiveness. We could be global leaders. We have the knowledge base and we have the NHS, an unrivalled combination.'These words are at odds with the Government's gung-ho pronouncements: 'Britain's academic and industrial research prowess means that we are already among the leading players in genetics research and development,' writes John Reid, the Health Secretary, in his forward to the White Paper. 'We are determined to harness that potential and ensure the benefits of genetics are realised throughout the NHS.'But one of our respondents, from the front line, remains gloomy: 'I hope the Government doesn't believe its own publicity material, or we are in a worse mess than I thought.'"
telegraph,10/6/2003 0:01,news," A licence to work with human eggs in an experiment that prepares the way for the first human cloning in Britain has been issued to the Roslin Institute in Scotland, home of Dolly the sheep.The licence to carry out human parthenogenesis - Greek for 'virgin birth' - will provide insights into how to boost the supply of human eggs for fertility treatments and help refine plans to use cloning to create stem cells from a patient's own tissue for research and treatments for a vast range of diseases.The Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority, granted the licence, the first for parthenogenesis, to the creator of Dolly, Prof Ian Wilmut, who was yesterday abroad and unavailable for comment.Most plants can multiply by parthenogenesis and so do all fungi and many animals, such as corals. Parthenogenesis is impossible for humans, however, because a process called imprinting means that human embryos need maternal and paternal genes to develop. But it is possible to use a shock of electricity or chemicals to make a human egg divide for a few days, as a parthenogenetic embryo, before dying.The Roslin now wants to make parthenogenetic human embryos to test if its attempts to ripen immature human eggs, such as those in ovarian tissue, have been successful. Success will be important to address the shortage of human eggs for research on cloning of human embryos, which could provide stem cells from individual patients for the study of serious genetic disease or even for novel treatments.A better understanding of how to encourage eggs to mature in the laboratory may also help women undergoing IVF treatment, notably those suffering from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, when their eggs do not mature properly. Armed with understanding of how best to mature eggs in the laboratory, Roslin will find it easier to get permission for a proposal it is developing to clone human embryos to produce stem cells for treatments.Suzi Leather, the HFEA chairman, said: 'After careful consideration of all the scientific, ethical and medical aspects of the project, the HFEA Licence Committee agreed to grant an initial one-year research licence to the Roslin Institute.'"
telegraph,14/04/2003 00:00,news," Scientists have said that they have finished writing the 'book of life', the three billion letters of DNA that make up the human genome. The successful completion of the Human Genome Project was announced more than two years ahead of schedule. Less than three years ago the publicly funded International Human Genome Consortium produced a working draft of the genome - a feat compared with landing men on the moon. Celera Genomics in the US delivered a private first version of the genome at the same time. But the finished sequence was needed before the full benefits of the new knowledge could be realised. Scientists believe it will usher in a new era of discovery and medical advances. Professor Allan Bradley, director of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, which carried out nearly a third of the work, said: 'Completing the human genome is a vital step on a long road but the eventual health benefits could be phenomenal. 'Just one part of this work - the sequencing of chromosome 20 - has already accelerated the search for genes involved in diabetes, leukaemia and childhood eczema. We shouldn't expect immediate major breakthroughs but there is no doubt we have embarked on one of the most exciting chapters of the book of life.' Access to the human genome is already powering drug discovery research in both academic and research organisations. More than 350 biomedical advances have reached clinical trial stage, although experts point out that it may be many years before new drugs originating from the genome appear on the market. Human Genome Project data, which is freely available, has attracted a huge number of inquiries from scientists around the world. Weekly hits on the Ensembl website, partly run by the Sanger Institute, have risen from 30,000 in June 2000 when the draft sequence was published, to almost 600,000 today. Dr Jane Rogers, head of sequencing at the Institute, said: 'We have reached the limits we set on this project, achieving tremendously high standards of quality much more quickly than we hoped. The working draft allowed researchers to kick-start a multitude of biomedical projects.'Now they have a highly polished end product which will assist them even more. It's a bit like moving on from a first-attempt demo music tape to a classic CD.' "
telegraph,2/2/2007 0:01,news,"                                             Video: Virgin stem cell bank                                             A bank to store stem cells from newborn babies was launched yesterday by Sir Richard Branson.                                        Flexible cells from umbilical cord blood can already provide life-saving transplant treatments for blood cancers and immune disorders.          The thinking behind the Virgin Health Bank is that developments in tissue regeneration technology in the next decade may also allow the use of an individual's stored cord blood stem cells to grow replacement cells and tissues if and when they are needed.          Sir Richard's scheme is a radical venture for his business empire. It will provide a dual private/public service from its own freezers set up at an existing bank run by the company BioVault in Plymouth.          Each stored sample will be divided and placed in two banks, one (20 per cent of the blood) for the child's personal use, which is unlikely to be used in the short term, and the remaining 80 per cent used in a public bank to make donated cells freely available to anyone who needs them.          Parents will be asked to pay £1,500 to collect their child's umbilical cord blood stem cells, which is competitive with the cost of the handful of existing private cord banks. In return they will have a store of cord stem cells as an insurance policy that might benefit their child in the future.          What is unique is that other patients worldwide will also have access to banked, tissue-matched stem cells. The only charge will be for transport, since it is illegal to charge for human tissue.          'Virgin Health Bank has an important role to play in making more of these special cells available,' said Sir Richard.          'We all know that the NHS has limited funds and can only do so much – in fact I was visited by a senior professor who is very involved in the NHS collection service and it was clear that the main problem is the lack of stem cells.' He added that he wants to launch similar banks worldwide.          The scheme is funded by around £10 million from Merlin Biosciences, the venture capital fund set up by Sir Chris Evans, the scientist/entrepreneur who sits on the board of Virgin Health Bank.          The Virgin brand is considered to be worth the same, so half the profits will go to Virgin. Sir Richard said he would give his profits to charities such as the Anthony Nolan Trust involved in treating leukaemia. But the chief executive officer of the bank, Andrew Davis, emphasised:'This is a business. We are not saying we are a charity.'          Ian Gibson MP, the former chairman of the Commons science and technology committee, gave a qualified welcome. 'It sounds really good but when you get into the details there are some murky corners that need to be divulged,' he said.          Success or failure may lie in the hands of NHS managers.          Prof Nicholas Fisk, of Imperial College London, said collecting cord blood was 'a real pain', being an unwelcome distraction in caesareans and other complex births, given that collection methods vary among cord blood companies.          To date, there has been 'little scientific validity' for private banking. More than half of maternity units refuse to bank blood. Virgin should provide additional staffing to ensure success, he added.          Prof Fisk also warned that in a child's early years their own stem cells are unlikely to help them if they have a condition such as leukaemia, unlike healthy donated cells. The chance of using cord blood for your own baby was 'almost nil', he added.          Where Virgin's plan was unusual was making some of each donation of cord blood available for use by others because, unlike bone marrow, cord stem cells do not have to be a perfect match to take.          'Public cord banking is a very laudable aim and they are doing it in a clever way by mixing private and public usage,' said Prof Fisk. Virgin said it would rely on the 20 per cent of hospitals who have an existing policy of storing cord blood for its supplies.

telegraph,2/2/2007 0:01,news,"                                             Video: Virgin Stem Cell Bank                                             A bank to store stem cells from newborn babies was launched yesterday by Sir Richard Branson.         Flexible cells from umbilical cord blood can already provide life-saving transplant treatments for blood cancers and immune disorders.         The thinking behind the Virgin Health Bank is that developments in tissue regeneration technology in the next decade may also allow the use of an individual's stored cord blood stem cells to grow replacement cells and tissues if and when they are needed.         Sir Richard's scheme is a radical venture for his business empire. It will provide a dual private/public service from its own freezers set up at an existing bank run by the company BioVault in Plymouth.         Each stored sample will be divided and placed in two banks, one (20 per cent of the blood) for the child's personal use, which is unlikely to be used in the short term, and the remaining 80 per cent used in a public bank to make donated cells freely available to anyone who needs them.         Parents will be asked to pay £1,500 to collect their child's umbilical cord blood stem cells, which is competitive with the cost of the handful of existing private cord banks. In return they will have a store of cord stem cells as an insurance policy that might benefit their child in the future.         What is unique is that other patients worldwide will also have access to banked, tissue-matched stem cells. The only charge will be for transport, since it is illegal to charge for human tissue.         'Virgin Health Bank has an important role to play in making more of these special cells available,' said Sir Richard.         'We all know that the NHS has limited funds and can only do so much – in fact I was visited by a senior professor who is very involved in the NHS collection service and it was clear that the main problem is the lack of stem cells.' He added that he wants to launch similar banks worldwide.         The scheme is funded by around £10 million from Merlin Biosciences, the venture capital fund set up by Sir Chris Evans, the scientist/entrepreneur who sits on the board of Virgin Health Bank.         The Virgin brand is considered to be worth the same, so half the profits will go to Virgin. Sir Richard said he would give his profits to charities such as the Anthony Nolan Trust involved in treating leukaemia. But the chief executive officer of the bank, Andrew Davis, emphasised:'This is a business. We are not saying we are a charity.'         Ian Gibson MP, the former chairman of the Commons science and technology committee, gave a qualified welcome.

telegraph,15/02/2007 00:01,news,"            A pioneering stem cell trial plans to find out, reports                   An experiment to see if fat can actually be good for a diseased heart has seen the first patient receive  an implant of stem cells isolated from their own fat tissue.            Around the world scientists are investigating the potential of stem cells - parent cells that have the potential to develop into other types to carry out repair and regeneration. In this case, the were stem cells implanted in damaged cardiac tissue to seed the growth of blood vessels to nourish the diseased heart.          The stem cells derived from the  fat (adipose) tissue were used last week on a patient in the first trial of its kind on cardiovascular disease, carried out at the Hospital Gregorio Maranon in Madrid, Spain, by Prof  Francisco Fernandez-Aviles and Dr  Emerson Perin, director of the Stem Cell Centre at the Texas Heart Institute.             The first patient , aged 67,  had a history of heart attacks.  He 'is doing well' and has now left the hospital.  'These cells may be optimal for targeting cardiovascular disease due to their ability to promote blood vessel growth,' said Dr. Perin. 'This primary mode of action demonstrated in pre-clinical studies could result in significant clinical benefit.'             The study will enrol 36 patients suffering from chronic myocardial ischaemia, a severe form of  coronary artery disease, which is estimated to affect hundreds of thousands of patients in Europe and the United States.              Patients in the study will receive their own adult stem and regenerative cells, thereby avoiding the risk of rejection or disease transmission that exists with donor stem cells and the controversy associated with embryonic stem cells.             Once introduced into a patient's heart, the hope is that the cells will help the body improve blood supply that can restore circulation to the heart. The results are expected by the middle of the year.            'Patients with chronic heart disease today have few options making this an important milestone for the affected patients and doctors that treat them,' said Dr Marc Hedrick, President of Cytori Therapeutics, the company that developed a way to isolate the stem cells.          'Our ultimate goal is to asses the clinical therapeutic effect of the cells, which were shown in preclinical studies to significantly improve heart function.'             Before the transplant, adipose tissue is removed from the patient using a liposuction-like procedure, placed into the Cytori system and, with the touch of a button, processed. About an hour later, a prescribed dose of stem and regenerative cells are delivered to the patient.              The company is also studying the safety and feasibility of using adult stem cells from fat tissue in breast cancer patients for breast reconstruction, having implanted them in 11 patients so far.  'Early data suggest that the procedure was safe and well tolerated and showed signs of efficacy in reversing some of the affects of radiation damage,' said a Cytori spokesman, adding a larger trial is now planned in Europe.

telegraph,8/4/2008 0:03,news,"            As a national conference looks at the furore over the use of human-animal embryos for research, Roger Highfield attempts to make sense of the sensational                                                               Telegraph TV: Lord Robert Winston on whether embryos are humans                                                                        Case for and against human-animal embryos for research                                             Recent weeks have seen a furore erupt over controversial laws that would allow the creation of human-animal embryos for research, with much talk of the sacredness of human life and the danger of scientists playing God.          But there are some, both professors and priests, who are using the facts in ways that are at best selective and at worst misleading. More importantly, even though proponents say there is a moral imperative to do hybrid embryo research to find cures, some scientists are sceptical that it is worth diverting money from more promising research.         Last week the news emerged that Newcastle University had created the first European hybrids, a blend of cow and human. The coverage made much of how the embryos could yield highly flexible parent cells, or stem cells, that could be used in a dizzying array of treatments, from diabetes to heart disease.         This is precisely the kind of science that the Embryology Bill is designed to address, and that has caused such bitter argument. Opponents of the Bill try to convince the public that embryos are 'people' whose 'body parts' will be raided by monstrous researchers to make 'Frankenstein creations' (in fact these 'people' are microscopic balls of cells).          Yet some scientists have also been manipulating the media when it comes to the most divisive part of proposed legislation, to allow 'admixed human embryos'. They have underplayed concerns by their peers that this work is speculative by downplaying the role of animal DNA.         In the Bill, these embryos could result from a human egg and animal sperm, or blends of cells from animal and human embryos (chimaeras). The Newcastle team made another version, a 'cybrid'.          This is created by inserting human DNA, in the form of a broken human cell, into an empty animal egg, in the same cloning method used to make Dolly the sheep.         This work will be high on the agenda of the first national stem cell research conference being held in Edinburgh this week. There is a need for more science in the public debate because the animal DNA does a special job in these embryos, one which diminishes their direct relevance to cures.          The cells in our bodies contain two kinds of DNA. Most research concerns nuclear DNA, so named because it resides in a compartment in the heart of cells called the nucleus. This DNA comes from our parents, and provides the recipe for the proteins that make and run the body.          Variations in this genetic message have been linked to the inheritance of individual characteristics, and also to hereditary diseases and risk of illnesses.         The animal DNA in the cybrids would be of the second kind, which resides in lozenge-like structures outside the nucleus called mitochondria. These are power packs that we inherit from our mothers.          Scientists say that cybrids of human and animal are '99.9 per cent human', in order to comfort those who think (wrongly) that an embryo would end up with horns or hooves. But this figure misleads the vast majority of people, who know little about human biology.         There probably is about 0.1 per cent animal DNA by weight when there are 500 cells in the embryo. But in the initial embryo, there are 100,000 copies of the mitochondrial DNA, around half animal DNA by weight.          This proportion declines because only the nuclear DNA replicates at first. In addition, some human mitochondria could come along for the ride with the human nuclear DNA and persist as the cells grow, perhaps even take over.         The 99.9 per cent figure probably refers to the fact that there are 37 instructions (genes) in mitochondrial DNA, compared with 29,000 in nuclear, which means 0.1 per cent animal instructions. But this is hardly reassuring.          Decades of work has shown that even one genetic spelling mistake in the three billion letters of the nuclear code can be fatal - just 0.0000001 per cent. And mitochondria are important: faults in them are responsible for around 50 metabolic disorders that affect one in every 6,500 people.          This includes fatal liver failure, stroke-like episodes, blindness, mental retardation, muscle weakness, diabetes and deafness.         Some claim that using animal mitochondrial DNA in cybrids would be like changing a battery in a computer, leaving the 'hard disk' - the nuclear DNA - unaffected. But Dr Marc Vermulst of the University of Washington in Seattle, who has linked changes in mitochondria to premature ageing, says: 'In flies, if you mix the mitochondrial DNA of one strain with the nuclear DNA of another strain, the mitochondria of the mixed strain work less efficiently than they normally would.          By evolving together, mitochondria and nuclei have become very finely tuned to each other. I am not sure how well human and cow DNA would communicate with each other. That would be very important.'         Although a pioneering study in China suggested rabbit and human could be successfully blended, using animal mitochondria in human cells could sometimes be like trying to put AA batteries into an AAA compartment.          For animal and human DNA to work in harmony is 'a big ask,' says Prof Neil Scolding, a Catholic stem cell researcher at Bristol University. Prof Jun-Ichi Hayashi, of University of Tsukuba, who in the latest issue of Science shows that mitochondrial mutations can encourage tumours to spread, has also - unsuccessfully - tried to make mouse nuclear DNA work with rat mitochondria.          'It is clear that human embryos with animal mitochondrial DNA may develop in the initial stage,' he says, 'but [they] could not survive any further.'         Prof Scolding points out that, thanks to pioneering work in Japan, there is now an egg and embryo-free alternative source of stem cells, albeit one that might present other ethical issues (such as the ability of men to make eggs).          'That has led scientists all over the place (including Sir Ian Wilmut, the creator of Dolly) to embrace this technology. Which makes it all the more inexplicable why a small minority of UK stem cell scientists wants to pursue the extraordinarily complex and frankly speculative hybrid approach.'         For many scientists, such as British stem cell pioneer and Nobel prizewinner Sir Martin Evans, resolving such issues provides a clear scientific rationale for using cybrids to find out more about the basic role of mitochondria in development and in disease.          There is, for example, research at Newcastle to transplant healthy human mitochondria to treat serious metabolic diseases that could benefit from that. However, the hard sell has been about the medical use of cybrid stem cells - not by using the cells themselves in human bodies, but to test drugs and study disease.          When even human stem cells are poorly understood, it will take a lot of slogging to show whether cybrid stem cells will behave properly. Here, even Sir Martin feels the immediate potential has been hyped and claims about cures 'overheated'."
telegraph,21/10/2004 00:01,news,"            Cloned nerve stem cells and the use of viruses as micro-surgeons could soon help people with serious illnesses. Science Editor Roger Highfield reports                  The human brain is the most complex known object in the universe. Even though scientists still understand little about how the 100,000 million nerve cells in this chemical machine store memories and create consciousness, they are racing to develop ways to repair the brain as it ages and after it is damaged by strokes and diseases such as Parkinson's.          In the past few weeks, two British companies have announced promising new approaches: one is growing replacement nerve cells and the second is using viruses to carry out delicate brain surgery at the molecular level.          In Guildford, Dr John Sinden's company, ReNeuron, has found a way to mass produce - clone - human foetal nerve stem cells in the laboratory. The result is a potentially unlimited supply of human nerve stem cells for repair.          Previously, scientists have tried to treat Parkinson's with foetal brain tissue. But this required several foetuses for each patient, which raised practical and ethical concerns, and there was poor control over what tissue was being implanted. One company, Layton Biosciences in America, used nerve cells isolated from a special cancer, called a teratocarcinoma. But there is unease about implanting cancer cells.          Instead, ReNeuron took a few thousand brain cells from a tiny sample of brain material from a single foetus aborted for medical reasons - with ethical approval, consent of the mother and no inducement - and found a way to derive around 100 cell lines, from which a handful of promising lines was chosen.          The tricky part was finding out how to multiply the cells into vast quantities, so freeing the scientists from the need to use any more foetal material, said ReNeuron's Dr Kenny Pollock. The team eventually found that a virus could be used to introduce a growth-promoting gene, called c-mycER, which enables the foetal brain cells to divide endlessly. Using this approach, a single cell can generate a billion identical cells. The clever part was that, for the gene to work, a drug called 4OHT also had to be added. And when 4OHT was withdrawn, the cells stopped dividing.          By using genetic surgery to temporarily 'immortalise' cells, the company has banked millions of nerve stem cells in its laboratories. One such cell line, called ReN001, was tested in rats and reliably turns into functional nerve cells or neurones.          'They have the world's first ever clonal immortalised stem cells which are 100 per cent stable, and are homogeneous and fully functional,' said Sir Chris Evans, chairman of Merlin Biosciences, which has helped fund the work since it was started by Dr Sinden at King's College London a decade ago.           Stem cells, as the name suggests, are parent cells of other types. The hope is that when ReNeuron's nerve stem cells are implanted, naturally present growth factors will turn them into various types, be it brain cells to treat stroke and Huntington's, nerve cells to repair a damaged spine, or retinal cells for blindness.          Earlier this month, encouraging studies of the use of the human stem cells to treat stroke in rats were reported to the American Neurological Association annual meeting in Toronto by Dr Sinden. The cells, though human, caused a minimal inflammatory response and treated rodents had a 'significant' restoration of movement and an enhanced sense of feeling, in detecting and removing sticky tape on their paws. Later this month, at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego, the company will also publish encouraging results in treating animal models of the brain disorder Huntington's disease.          After further safety checks in animals, ReNeuron hopes to have approval to begin clinical trials by the start of 2006, initially in around 30 patients who have suffered long-term disabilities after stroke. If injections improve sensation and function, ReNeuron believes its ReN001 could be the first neural stem cells to treat a major disease.          Meanwhile, the use of viruses to modify brain cells is being developed by Professor Alan Kingsman of Oxford Biomedica. For two decades, he and his wife, Sue, have studied a family of viruses, including HIV, called lentiviruses. From one, the equine infectious anaemia virus, they have perfected a way to carry out genetic surgery. Crucially, while most viruses invade dividing cells, these lentiviruses offer a way to deliver genes to non-dividing cells such as neurones, the major functional cells of the brain.          The Kingsmans dismantled these viruses: some genes (called gag/pol) make the core, which determines the ability of the virus to invade non-dividing cells; others code for the envelope, which makes a halo of 'spikes' that enable the virus to stick to cells; and there are genes that regulate how a host cell is turned into a virus factory.          Inessential bits are stripped from the natural virus and replaced by genes that treat disease. The result: modified viruses that are unable to cause infection but can deliver a therapeutic gene or genes to the patient.          The resulting 'lentivectors' blend genes according to the task. One mission is to repair the damage caused by Parkinson's disease, when 200,000 cells in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra no longer make dopamine, a messenger chemical. An inability to move and tremors develop because dopamine is needed by another region of the brain, the striatum. Now the team has developed a virus to implant three dopamine-making genes into this region and not into others, since this could cause side effects.          Experiments on rats show how the genes can be delivered precisely by injections of a millionth of a litre of virus. 'What we find is that, with the right volume of material going in at the right pressure, we can control the distribution of the genetic modification in the brain,' said Prof Kingsman.          An animal model of the disease has shown that injections of this lentivector, 'ProSavin', produce remarkable improvements. Injections can restore almost normal movement. 'The ProSavin animals are up and jumping about and look completely normal,' said Prof Kingsman. The company hopes to apply to use the approach, which would require injections directly into the brain, next year.          In other research, the Oxford BioMedica team has coated a lentivector with the proteins from a rabies virus. This has enabled the team to exploit a remarkable property of this virus: once introduced into muscle by a bite, the natural virus can infect motor neurones, the nerve cells in the spine that have extensions - called axonal projections - that project up to a metre to transmit brain signals to muscles.          Rabies-coat proteins enable the engineered lentivector to hitch a lift on molecular motors that travel up and down the neurones so it can dump its therapeutic genes into the heart of the motor neurone. Aside from being a 'fascinating research tool', this virus offers a way to treat motor neurone disease.          One form of the disease, called ALS, usually results in paralysis and death three to five years after onset. There is currently no known cure for the disease, which affects about 100,000 people in Europe and America.          In Oxford Biomedica's treatment, a lentivector is injected into muscle to deliver the gene for VEGF, a nerve-protecting factor, into the nerve cells of the spine. A single jab delayed onset and slowed progression in mice, extending life expectancy by 30 per cent, according to a recent study in the journal Nature by Dr Mimoun Azzouz of Oxford BioMedica and the Centre for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy, Belgium.          Human trials are now planned in 2006, bringing hope to the 5,000 or so sufferers in Britain. The downside is that, to get the virus in all the motor neurones, patients would be turned into pincushions. But, given that it is such an awful disease, Prof Kingsman expects patients to have few qualms. 'This is amazing technology,' he said. "
telegraph,27/01/2007 00:01,culture,"            One in 33 children in Britain is born with a genetic disorder and, of those, some are destined for short, painful lives. Now new treatments, including experimental gene therapy, are giving the lucky few their futures back. By Andrea Kon                  Alexander Locke greets visitors with a cheeky grin, charging around his home in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, like any normal three-year-old dynamo. But until five years ago, a child like him might have been doomed to a tragically short life spent within the confines of a germ-free 'bubble'.          He was born, in August 2003, three weeks premature and weighing 2.74kg (6lb), and appeared to be a perfect, healthy baby. His parents could not possibly have known that their son was the victim of a life-threatening genetic disorder, severe combined immunodeficiency – known as SCID. Alexander was born with a defective gene on his X chromosome, inherited from his mother, Carol.          According to Prof Andy Copp, dean of the Institute of Child Health (ICH) in London, one child in every 33 in Britain has a genetic disorder – that is one born every 30 minutes. There are more than 4,000 recognised genetic disorders, of varying severity, and for most of them there is no treatment and, until now, little hope of cure. The newly established virtual Jeans for Genes Centre for Inherited Diseases at ICH may soon change that. Its research is identifying rogue genes that cause such diseases.          Last year, Jeans for Genes raised £2.6 million from its Jeans for Genes Day in October (when anyone can pay for the privilege of wearing jeans to work or to school for just one day of the year). The money helps to fund research projects such as those being undertaken by the consultant paediatric immunologist Dr Bobby Gaspar at ICH and Great Ormond Street Hospital. The mission is to manipulate faulty genes that cause these devastating diseases and offer life and hope to very sick children. The work is still at the early, experimental stages.          'With SCID children, there is a problem in a gene that controls their immune systems,' Gaspar explains. 'If we think of genes as a sentence, then the words in that sentence need to be arranged in the right order to make sense. In SCID an important sentence is written incorrectly, and so no longer makes sense. We now have the ability to create that sentence or gene. We then place this correct gene into a harmless virus that has also been manufactured in the lab.          'The virus acts as a 'delivery van' carrying the manipulated genes into the early cells of the bone marrow. It then takes several months for newly corrected bone marrow cells to grow and produce an immune system strong enough to beat infections. This gene therapy treatment has so far saved the lives of 13 children in Britain. We are working to expand it, to hunt down genetic faults and treat many more genetic diseases in children who would otherwise suffer blighted lives.'          A miracle? His fellow consultant, the immunologist and director of the Gene Therapy Programme at ICH, Prof Adrian Thrasher, shakes his head. 'No. These are new forms of medicine, so we can think of the treatment in the same way that we use any other drug for illness. The exciting thing is that we can now see how these new drugs can start to help patients with serious diseases, for which previous treatments have been ineffective.'                      Alexander Locke, three                   Carol and Colin Locke were horrified to discover that Alexander, their only son, was suffering from X-linked SCID, a previously terminal genetic disease. Colin Locke, 44, who runs his own recruitment agency, explains: 'We realised Alexander had a problem when his tummy button inexplicably failed to heal after birth, despite repeated courses of antibiotics. At four months, he developed a severe viral respiratory infection. He spent his first Christmas in hospital, attached to oxygen lines and antibiotic drips. Eventually they allowed us home for New Year. Instead of a celebration, it was a nightmare. We slept in the lounge with Alexander propped upright in his baby bouncer. On New Year's Day, he was readmitted to hospital.'          Doctors were shocked by his apparent instantaneous relapse. 'When we took him back, they asked us what we'd done to him, as though it was our fault,' says Carol, 46, a computer network support contractor. Tests showed that Alexander's immune system was malfunctioning. He was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital the following day, where the immunology team were waiting. Dr Bobby Gaspar told them that Alexander was suffering from X-linked SCID and his only hope was a bone-marrow transplant. But the couple soon learnt that suitable bone-marrow donors (the marrow has to be an absolutely perfect match and totally free of viruses) can be very hard to find.          Alexander was placed in an airlocked room, which was to be his 'home' on and off for the next eight months. His family and medical team had to stand in the airlock while the air around them was filtered and purified before they could approach him.          The alternative to a bone-marrow transplant was gene therapy, using his own bone marrow, which is then treated with a doctored gene and reintroduced. 'We met Prof Thrasher, who works with Dr Gaspar, and that was when gene therapy was first mentioned,' Carol explains. 'There are many kinds of SCID, but Alex had the X-linked form: he had inherited his defective X-gene from me and it was hard to accept that it was my 'fault'. I had no idea I carried a 'bad' X-gene. We were warned that the treatment was in its infancy – 'in its research phase' is how they termed it.'          Because gene therapy was so experimental, a request for the revolutionary treatment would need to be approved by a national regulating body, the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee (GTAC). 'Every avenue needed to be explored,' Colin says. 'We begged doctors to start the GTAC process, even while the hunt was on to find a perfect bone-marrow donor. Our hopes were raised, then dashed, when an almost perfect donor was found to harbour a virus, harmless to her, but a potential killer for our son.'          As soon as GTAC granted approval, Alexander was prepared for surgery. His bone marrow was removed on Monday March 22, 2004, under a general anaesthetic. It was manipulated in various laboratories and the modified marrow was reintroduced via a drip the following Friday.          'Alexander was allowed home for the first time in May, aged eight months. It was more complicated than having a newborn,' Carol smiles. 'Every tube and piece of equipment needed sterilising. We had to use a spreadsheet to keep track of his medical regime. He had lost the ability to suck during the first days in intensive care and was being fed through a gastronasal tube. We were administering four drugs four times a day through the tube. As he grew older and more wilful, he used to pull the tubes out and we had to fight to get them back in. He needed continuous oxygen and immunoglobulin injections every week. Colin did the injections. I changed the tube.'          It takes time for the genes to replicate sufficiently to rebuild the immune system, and twice, despite the Lockes' stringent routines, Alexander's Hickman line (a permanent intravenous device) became infected and he was rushed back to Great Ormond Street. 'The second time doctors fought a nine-hour battle for his life; we were so lucky. It's astounding he didn't suffer any long-term brain damage,' Colin says.          Once he had recovered, Alexander raced to catch up with his lost childhood. 'Amazingly, he loved mixing with other children, although he had never played with a child until six months ago,' Carol says. 'We feared that his life as a 'bubble baby' might have left developmental or physical scars, but he's caught up in every way. The only treatment he needs now is a prophylactic course of antibiotics once a fortnight.          'He's happiest when he's at nursery and when other children come to play. Soon he'll go to primary school. That would have been unthinkable two years ago.'                      Joanne Wilson, 20                   Joanne Wilson, a student radiographer at Exeter University, suffers from a rare genetic enzyme deficiency, mucopolysaccharide disease (MPS), which affects approximately 1,200 people in Britain, all of whom have a missing enzyme. Mucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar molecules used in the building of connective tissue in the body. Normally there is a continuous process in the body of replacing these used materials and breaking them down for disposal. Joanne and the other 126 people in Britain with MPS Type 1 are missing the particular type of enzyme that is essential to cut up these sugar molecule chains. As a result, they remain stored in cells in the body and cause progressive damage to every bone and organ. Babies may show little sign of the disease, but as more and more cells become damaged, symptoms start to manifest.          Joanne is a petite redhead – small stature is part of the syndrome. It took doctors years to diagnose her problems. 'My parents first realised something was wrong when I had an umbilical hernia at four,' she said. (Usually, if an umbilical hernia occurs, it happens before a baby's first birthday.) 'I was continually complaining of aches all over my body. Doctors said they were 'growing pains' but my parents wouldn't accept that. Some days, I refused to go out and play. I felt so different from other children. When I was seven, I told my parents my fingers were 'sprinkling', my way of describing pins and needles.          'My hands were clawing and becoming very stiff. It made writing really difficult. I was referred to a specialist who diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome and operated. Because a lot of my problems were invisible, teachers assumed I was just being annoying. But my parents knew something was badly wrong. At the age of 10, I looked like an arthritic 70-year-old granny when I tried to get out of a chair. Not a little girl.'          Thanks to her parents Barbara and Barry's persistence, she was referred to a paediatrician at Birmingham Children's Hospital. 'The doctor couldn't find a condition that fitted all my symptoms.' By chance, the doctor's father, also a doctor, was retiring and at his retirement party with other doctors, they discussed case studies. Joanne's paediatrician pleaded, 'If anyone has any idea what to do with this child, please tell me.' 'One of them suggested I should have a blood test for MPS at Great Ormond Street. It was positive. I had apparently inherited the defective gene from both my parents.'          MPS is a slow, progressive disease. Ten years ago there was no cure. 'Because of the missing enzyme, substances were building up around all my joints. I also had a heart murmur so I am under a cardiologist's care. This disease can affect every part of your body, including the airways, so I still need to be checked by an ENT specialist. It could cause my spleen and liver to become enlarged so I have regular ultrasounds, too.'          Joanne has undergone 17 operations to straighten her limbs, unclaw her hands and feet, repair hernias and straighten her legs and spine. 'An operation on my back led to six months in a wheelchair. I longed to go to university to study medicine. But I was often too tired to work. I couldn't even manage to cook a meal for myself, so my chances of living an independent life were virtually nil,' she says. Yet, despite missing so much school, she managed to get four good A-levels. 'My parents were amazingly supportive.'          When she was 10, she joined the MPS Society and heard about trials on enzyme replacement therapy taking place in America. (MPS may one day be a suitable candidate for gene therapy, but research on that approach is at an even earlier stage.) 'When trials started in England, I begged to be included. However, my local Primary Care Trust turned down me down because it costs £300,000 a year. Eventually the society stepped in, explaining that without the treatment I would become completely wheelchair-bound. They asked the PCT, 'How can you measure quality of life in terms of money?'          Finally, two years ago, they agreed funding and I had my first treatment. At first, there were no physical changes, but mentally, I felt a great weight had been lifted off my mind: I knew I wouldn't get any worse. Three months on, I didn't need my tablets any more. I could never have imagined the difference enzyme therapy would make. I could dress myself properly alone, do my own hair for the first time in my life, make myself supper, write pages of essays with no problems. It was wonderful to be so independent.'          She applied to go to Exeter University to read radiography and is now in her second year. 'I absolutely love it. Life is just so different to the way it was two years ago. I'm going to make a difference to others now.' She has joined the Dance Society, and does street dance, hip-hop, contemporary dance and ballet. 'I'm making up for lost time. I'm engaged and Alex, my fiancé, and I plan to marry in a couple of years. Every week I spend a day in hospital having my treatment. But that's a very small price to pay for a near-normal life.'                      Kane Quirk, six                   Kane Quirk suffers from chronic granulomatous disorder (CGD). It is another X-linked genetic disease, inherited from his mother. His mother, grandmother and great-grandmother are now all known to be carriers (it is women who are carriers and men often sufferers). His mother's cousin has a two-year-old boy who suffers from the disease, and other boy babies in the family have died in the past from unknown causes, now suspected to have been undiagnosed CGD.          Yet, until Kane's birth (he is the second of four children and the only boy), his parents, Vicky, a 27-year-old housewife, and Mick, a 43-year-old mechanical engineer, had no idea that Vicky carried a faulty X-gene. But as yet, doctors have not managed to find a way to manipulate the faulty gene in a way that will offer a cure.          When Kane was born on December 27, 2000, on the Isle of Wight, he was covered in little white pustules. Doctors put it down to an infection he had picked up in the womb. When he failed to thrive, suffered from diarrhoea and could not hold his feeds, they thought he might have a milk intolerance. However, he fared little better on soya substitutes. At seven months, he developed a lump on his forearm. 'They told us it must be an insect bite that had become infected,' his mother says. 'He was treated with antibiotics, but the arm got bigger, redder and angrier.'          Vicky marched her son off to St Mary's Hospital, Newport. 'They picked up that Kane had a whole host of other problems. We were transferred to Southampton Hospital where he underwent a barrage of tests. One of the doctors there had seen CGD before and diagnosed it after just five days. I was horrified when they said he'd got it from me. I felt really guilty and couldn't stop crying. Even now it gets me down when he's ill.'          Looking at Kane, a bespectacled, serious little boy with a crew cut and vivid blue eyes, it is hard to believe he is so sick. Yet another child's sore throat can cause Kane to land up in hospital for weeks without prompt treatment. Effectively, he has a total intolerance of certain bacteria, although he can cope with a viral infection. 'The doctors have told us that children with CGD lack the ability to fight off certain bacterial and fungal infections because they do not have a full working set of genes. This means that they are susceptible to all sorts of illnesses such as pneumonias, bone infections and abscesses on vital organs such as the lungs and liver. They told us that it would have a big impact on our everyday life. And it does, although we do our best to carry on.'          Vicky keeps the family's small home spotless and clutter free, which is not easy with a lively family. She uses antiseptic wipes everywhere, and there are no obvious toys: they are all housed in the garden shed. Dust and dirt are potentially lethal to Kane. 'He's a typical boy, mad about football and Power Rangers, but he knows his limitations, don't you son?' she says ruffling Kane's hair fondly. 'He knows he can't go to the playground with his sisters because the bark chippings harbour fungi that can make him very ill. He can't kick autumn leaves, or play in mud or be anywhere near fresh grass cuttings for the same reason.          'We've paved our garden over so Kane can play out. Ordinary things that present no problems to other children can be life-threatening for a child with CGD. A knock or bruise can lead to an abscess. Decorating is hazardous because paint or brick dust can make him ill. He suffers from colitis with severe tummy pains and has to take strong antibiotics and anti-fungal medicine every day and steroids when the colitis is bad. He hates them. We know that both his quality of life and life expectancy are less than other children's.'          When Vicky was pregnant with the two younger girls, she was relieved to find she was having girls, but although she knows all three of her daughters could be carriers, she says they are 'too young' to be tested yet. You suspect that her sense of guilt means she would prefer not to know. They try to give all the children as normal a life as possible, which is not easy with all Kane's restrictions. Currently, he is under the everyday care of doctors at Southampton General and St Mary's.          They visit Great Ormond Street once a year and know they can rely on help from there at any time. 'Every year, we run events at school to help raise money for Jeans for Genes,' Vicky says. 'If things get really bad for Kane we might have to consider a bone-marrow transplant. But that's dangerous and means a long time in hospital. Gene therapy is our only real hope for the future.'

telegraph,20/03/2007 00:01,news,"            The man who cracked the human genome is trawling the high seas for his next challenge, reports Roger Highfield                   How to save the world: put one buccaneering entrepreneur-cum-bioscientist on a luxury yacht. Using some mighty fine nets, let him trawl the world's oceans for the smallest creatures.          Catalogue the genetic diversity of this, the most abundant form of life in the largest habitat on Earth. Then hijack the molecular machinery of these microbes to make clean energy, new drugs or boost the ability of the Earth's lungs to 'breathe' more carbon dioxide, and so limit global warming.         This may sound like the outline for a sci-fi potboiler but it sums up the remarkable efforts of Craig Venter, the maverick American scientist. Seven years ago, Venter announced at the White House that he had identified all the genes - the genome - in the DNA of a human being. It was the culmination of a bitter race with an international consortium of government labs, and his bull-in-a-china-shop approach earned him the epithet 'bad boy of science'.         It did not deter him, and while many of the critics in the scientific establishment who vilified him disappeared from view, Venter went on to become the first person to read his own genome and is also undertaking an extraordinary effort to create a synthetic genome for an artificial organism. Today, however, he is bobbing in the middle of the Sea of Cortez, mixing business with pleasure in a project to read marine DNA codes as he sails along the west coast of the Americas. His 29-metre sloop, Sorcerer II, is a floating laboratory. Rather than use the traditional method of studying micro-organisms by growing them in the lab, which only works with one species in every 100, Venter is obtaining (see graphic) the genetic codes of anything and everything present in sea water. The result is a radical new view of life in the oceans, the modern answer to Charles Darwin's 19th century voyage on the HMS Beagle. 'We are starting to view the world in a gene-centred fashion,' Venter says. 'Our goal is to try to sort out evolution, working back from the genes to what organisms are there.' He calls his approach 'metagenomics'.         Microbes make up the vast majority of life on the planet and account for up to 90 per cent of the biological mass in the sea. They are the central processors of matter and energy in ecosystems. They are responsible for the creation and maintenance of the air we breathe. They are also, perhaps, our biggest hope of slowing global warming. Our oceans are the biggest 'sink' of carbon, thanks in part to organisms that absorb carbon from the atmosphere to build their skeletons and shells, like 'lungs'. Remarkably, the vast majority of these organisms are unknown. 'It is important to understand their role and function to ensure the survival of the planet and human life,' says Venter, who is founder and chairman of the J Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland.         The Sorcerer II expedition began with a pilot project in 2003 in the Sargasso Sea near Bermuda in which more than a million new genes were discovered in what was thought to be the marine equivalent of a desert. For the next two years, Venter flew back and forth to join the crew as it sampled the waters from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to the Eastern Tropical Pacific. 'I did all the major ocean passages,' he said. One in particular, through the Panama Canal, up to Cocos Island and down to the Galapagos, 'was a transforming event, phenomenal' as he combined genomics with writing an autobiography and diving with sharks, all under the gaze of a Discovery Channel TV crew.         Using phenomenal computing power to reconstruct and analyse microbial DNA, with a single stage of the calculations taking more than a million hours of supercomputer time, a flood of discoveries has come from the latest phase of the expedition. Venter announced in a trio of papers in PloS Biology a few days ago that his team had returned to port with 400 newly discovered microbes and six million new genes. Each gene contains the instructions used to make the proteins that build and operate living things, and Venter's bounty doubles the number known to science. His company, Synthetic Genomics, wants to harness this genetic information to use the microbes to turn carbon dioxide into propane and other fuels, short-circuiting the traditional geological process where ancient creatures are compressed into coal and oil over the aeons. Another target is hydrogen production, the ultimate clean fuel.         When it comes to climate change, the expedition has thrown up another key insight. Some parts of the ocean have more carbon-hungry organisms than others, and it used to be thought that populations reflected local nutrient levels. But Venter has found that this is not the case. The culprit could be bacterial viruses - phages - which keep microbe levels low in some seas. 'If we can understand this relationship more, and find out how to inhibit the viruses, or make the bacteria resistant, we would have a lot more organisms capturing carbon dioxide,' says Venter.         The biggest impact of his project has been on basic science, overturning many established ideas about the tree of life. It used to be thought that the protein pigment in our own eyes that enables us to detect light was rare. But Venter's gene trawl reveals that all surface marine organisms make proteorhodopsins that detect coloured light. 'They turn out to be one of the most abundant and important gene families on the planet,' he said. Blue and green variants are found in different environments - blue light preferred in the open ocean such as the indigo Sargasso Sea and green light along coasts. Venter believes these proteins help microbes to use energy from the sun, as plants do, but without photosynthesis. Instead, they use this 'light-harvesting' machinery to pump charged atoms in the equivalent of solar batteries.         The team discovered many new proteins that protect microbes from UV rays and some that are involved in repairing the damage caused by UV. They were also surprised to discover that many kinds of protein that were thought to be specific to one kingdom of life were more widespread. But this is only the start.         'It's clear,' says Venter, 'that we've only begun to scratch the surface of understanding the microbial world.'                                                                              1. Microscopic organisms such as diatoms, dinoflagellates, and cyanobacteria lock up as much atmospheric carbon in the ocean as plant photosynthesis does on land. There are vast numbers, from a diatom called Thalassiosira pseudonana to Prochlorococcus marinus, the most abundant photosynthetic organism in the seven seas                           2. Venter's expedition focused on the DNA of these microbes, the thread-like chemical that contains the instructions (genes) to build and run an organism. The entire set of genes of an organism is its genome.                           3. Scientists on board the Sorcerer II collected water every 200 nautical miles and then filtered it through progressively smaller filters to collect bacteria and then viruses. These were sent for analysis to Venter's lab in Maryland. Current technology can only cope with reading a few hundred letters of DNA at a time.                           4. The secret is to use 'shotgun sequencing' to smash up genomes in different ways, read the DNA of the ends of large fragments, or entire small fragments, then use the most powerful computers - including one that was used to create Shrek - to look for overlaps and put the DNA fragments back together again .                           5. Focusing on bacteria at first, Venter's group analysed 7.7 million DNA sequences totalling 6.3 billion base pairs (roughly the complement of DNA found in our own cells) and more than 6 million new genes - doubling the number in the world's genetic databases. So far the team has only published information from a quarter of its samples.         "
telegraph,13/05/2008 00:01,news,"            The turmoil in the credit markets is jeopardising research that could help millions of lives, warns Sir Chris Evans, one of Britain's leading scientific entrepreneurs. He talks to Roger Highfield                  When it comes to breakthroughs in medical technology, this country has traditionally punched well above its weight: the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, penicillin, the development of body scanners and more besides.         The next revolution will be based around biotechnology, genetic discoveries that are expected to define this century as much as the splitting of the atom did the last.          The biotech industry, already worth £350billion, covers everything from the mass production of enzymes, hormones and proteins for use as drugs for arthritis or cancer to new kinds of diagnostics to spot those at risk of disease.          It promises the creation of medicine targeted to your individual genetic code, gene transplants to fix the damage caused by hereditary diseases and the use of stem cells to fix damaged hearts and brains. Such is its scientific and economic importance that Gordon Brown has promised that Britain 'should be the world's number one centre for genetic and stem cell research'.         But according to one of the country's most successful scientific entrepreneurs, a storm is brewing that could wreak havoc on the industry. Sir Chris Evans is one of the industry's most colourful figures: so closely connected to the Government that he was caught up in the cash-for-honours investigation, he has amassed a fortune estimated at £150million, raised more than a billion dollars over the past decade for cancer research, and is backing pioneering new treatments for strokes and autism. And he is deeply worried.         'It is a perilous time for UK biotech,' says Sir Chris, as we chat in his office near Pall Mall, an Aladdin's cave of rugby memorabilia, brass scientific instruments and sparkling geological specimens. 'This 2008 market is going to be unforgiving.'         Things were easier 21 years ago this month, when the Port Talbot-born Sir Chris 'was rushing around Cambridge looking to build my first company, one of the UK's very first true biotech start-ups'.          That company, Enzymatix, signalled the remarkable promise of the biotech revolution: it found a way to mass-produce a rare chemical called a phospholipid, which can lubricate the lungs of newborns, using enzymes from cabbages and components from eggs. This invention saved the lives of hundreds of premature babies - although, in typical pioneer fashion, Sir Chris and his colleagues had tested it on themselves first.         However, he thinks the chances of a similar breakthrough becoming a blockbuster treatment are now far smaller. 'We have a 'perfect storm' in the industry, because we have not delivered enough successful products quickly enough,' he says. 'At the same time, biotech shares have been steadily falling for two years as investors have shied away from the sector in the UK.         'To smash it all to the ground, along comes the sub-prime credit crunch fiasco to drive away any remnants of investors in risky biotech.'         Although this could, in the long term, weed out the good companies from the bad, the problem is that those good companies are now starved of the cash they need to help develop new treatments. There are 1,400 private biotech companies across Europe. Collectively, they are losing up to €2.5 billion per year, and half of them have less than a year's cash left. Biotech investment has halved in the past four years, and, according to Sir Chris, there is also a lack of entrepreneurs, and too few bankers who know their enzymes from their elbows.         Only a decade ago, Sir Chris set up Merlin, his first venture-capital company, to help fledgling biotech companies into the markets. Now he is pulling out of early-stage research, because Britain's baby biotech companies are 'all needing cash, and all struggling'. What some scientists refer to as a 'valley of death' has opened up between the lab, where research is usually backed by the Government, and the first dribble of commercial funding. The traditional route for a university researcher, of raising cash from family, friends and venture capitalists, then floating on the stock market, 'is definitely dead', he says. Instead, it is the giant pharmaceutical companies that are buying up the budding biotech outfits.         In terms of drugs that have been licensed for use in the market, this approach has proved more successful for the big firms than relying on their own in-house research. Up to half of newly patented drugs now come from biotech, and only 12 per cent from the well-funded but bloated company labs. This doesn't mean that they are the industry's white knights, though: Sir Chris says that they're storm-tossed ships, too - it's just that 'they've got more dinghies than anyone else'.         One recent research effort shows how politics can doom promising science. A few years ago, Sir Chris helped to set up the UK Stem Cell Foundation, a charity that would back leading-edge treatments, such as the use of bone marrow stem cells to treat heart attacks. 'We raised over £12million in cash, found 10 good projects and four have been backed,' he recalls.          But the Treasury insisted that Government backing came via the Medical Research Council, a violation of the 'Haldane principle' that holds that scientists, not ministers, should allocate research council funds. This proved problematic, as did the fact that Sir Chris had to step down after his arrest as part of police inquiries into the 'cash for peerages' allegations (in July, the Crown Prosecution Service found that there was insufficient evidence to bring the case to court). He is also still under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over complaints from a former staff member about some of Merlin's funds allegedly going missing - a charge he strenuously denies, but the probe has dragged on for years.         Another firm in which he has invested, Dr John Sinden's Guildford-based company ReNeuron, has also become bogged down by red tape. The company has found a way to mass-produce - clone - human foetal nerve stem cells in the laboratory, offering a potentially unlimited supply for repairing nerve cells. In what would have been the first trial of neural stem cells to treat a major disease, the company hoped in early 2006 to start treating around 30 patients who had suffered long-term disabilities after a stroke. But the company is still awaiting the green light from the US Food and Drug Administration.         'ReNeuron has done everything it should do and has pioneered the whole of this adult/foetal stem cell field for 10 years,' says Sir Chris. 'We're now at a point where its elegant, stable neuro stem cells are being stockpiled as we await the crucial FDA decision.' Frustrated with the lack of progress, ReNeuron has asked for approval from authorities in Australia and Britain to speed up the use of these stem cells, which could also be used for treating blindness, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's.         It's not all bad news, however: Sir Chris has high hopes for Neuropharm in Leatherhead, which is working on autism. This is a catch-all term for a number of disorders, making the prospect of a single treatment unlikely. However, a class of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which includes Prozac, does seem to cut the associated 'endless ritual' behaviours, anxiety and disruption. Building on work in New York, Neuropharm has developed a low-dose SSRI that 'works beautifully in autistic children and has been recently fast tracked by the FDA'. Formulations to treat Fragile-X, obsessive compulsive disorder and Rett syndrome are also in the pipeline.         If Sir Chris has proved anything, it is that it is possible to make money and help people at the same time. One testament to this is his fleet of sports cars, which includes Ferraris and Aston Martins. But his love of fast cars also underlines the risks of his business. In the early 1990s, while driving down Mill Lane in Cambridge: 'I nearly killed Stephen Hawking in my red beast when he shot out of nowhere,' says Sir Chris, shaking his head. 'Still sends shivers.'                     Do biotech drugs put too much strain on the NHS budget? Join the debate at the Cheltenham Science Festival on June 4.

telegraph,27/07/2012 18:27,education,"A competition aims to encourage more students to become donors, says Anna Tyzack. When George Bennett, 18, was diagnosed with aplastic anaemia last December, he   was forced to give up his college course and his part-time job as he simply   didn’t have enough energy to leave the house. A stem cell (also known as   bone marrow) transplant could save George’s life, but despite more than 17   million people registered as donors throughout the world, so far no match   has been found. He hopes that a new alliance between Ucas and Marrow,   the student branch of the blood cancer charity Anthony   Nolan, will encourage a wave of students to join the blood stem cell   register. “Young people, particularly men, make the most successful donors   of blood stem cells,” George says. “Whenever someone joins, there is hope   for someone like me.”At present, just 12 per cent of the register is made up of men aged 18 to 30.   Yet every 20 minutes, someone in Britain is diagnosed with blood cancer. Maeve Graham, 20, who is in her second year studying medicine at Leeds   University, received a stem cell transplant in 2005 after being diagnosed   with leukaemia and undergoing three rounds of chemotherapy. “The donor was a   30-year-old male from Germany and he saved my life,” she says. “People   imagine donating blood stem cells is a huge, painful operation, but it’s   actually much easier than you think to give someone a life-saving   transplant.” One of Marrow’s main challenges, according to Nathan Highton, 21, a final-year   medical student who is the charity’s president, is to explain to students   that donating stem cells is a simple, painless procedure. It takes just a   few minutes to join the register by signing a form and submitting a simple   saliva sample by post. “You don’t even have to visit a doctor,”   Maeve explains. If you happen to be called up as a match – the chances of which are about one   in 1,000, although if you’re a young man it is higher – the procedure you   will usually undergo is akin to a blood transfusion. First you receive a   course of injections to stimulate stem cells in your blood, then you spend   half a day in hospital connected to a blood transfusion machine. “You feel a   bit tired afterwards, but you’ll be back to normal within a few days,” Maeve   says. About 15 per cent of donors have bone marrow extracted from their   pelvis, a process which requires a general anaesthetic but is still   relatively painless. This summer the Telegraph has teamed up with Anthony Nolan and Ucas’s   Students Live Show (September 8 and 9) to launch a writing competition.   Ucas will be promoting the Write an Essay, Save a Life (details below) on   emails it sends out to students. “We spend a lot of time handing out fliers to students but now Ucas is   involved, with luck we will get more donors and volunteers to help with the   charity,” says Nathan. WRITE AN ESSAY, SAVE A LIFE - The Daily Telegraph has teamed up with Anthony Nolan and the Ucas’s   Students Live Show (September 8 and 9) to give students the chance to   win a two-week internship with its editorial team. Entrants are invited to submit a 200-word mini-essay on the subject: “Why you   should join the Anthony Nolan blood stem cell register”. It costs £10 to enter and all fees will be donated directly to the charity,   which uses its register to match stem cell donors to blood cancer patients   in need of a life-saving stem cell transplant.

The new legislation, which will be in place by Spring, could mean that   commercial GM crops including maize and oil seed rape are grown in Britain. In the short-term the crops are unlikely end up on our tables. They will be   sold for animal feed, and so enter food chain indirectly. However it opens the door for genetically modified fruit and vegetables to be   sold in British supermarkets. Currently the European Union bans the use of commerical crops because of   opposition across Europe. Under the new rules each European country will be allowed to decide for itself   whether or not to grow GM, once it has been ruled safe by the European Food   Safety Authority (EFSA), the EU’s food safety body. The deal has been engineered by the British government who are fed up that GM   trials continue to be blocked by Germany, France and Italy. Last week Lord de Mauley, the environment minister, told MPs that genetically   modified produce are a 'key agricultural technology for the 21st century'. He told the science and technology select committee that it will help 'undo   the logjam' in approvals for genetically modified crops at European   Union level. However, he said he was 'disappointed' that the legislation will   allow other European nations to make decisions to ban GM crops which are 'not   based on scientific evidence'. It is feared that farmers would be persuaded from growing GM because there   would be no export market. Genetically modified crops are currently being trialled at Rothamsted   Research, Hertfordshire and Norwich in Norfolk, but they will not be sold   commercially. Wales and Scotland are opposed to the use genetically modified   crops and will not be growing anyway. Genetically modified maize and oilseed rape were the most likely crops to be   grown in this country, alongside potatoes which require lower levels of   pesticides. They are likely to take several years to gain approval from   regulators. GM ingredients are already in food available on supermarket shelves, mostly in   cooking oils containing GM soy or oilseed rape. However these will be   labelled, according to EU law. Most supermarkets have banned GM ingredients   in their own-brand products. Waitrose continues to require non-GM feed for poultry, eggs and lamb. In April   2013, Tesco, the Co-Op and Marks and Spencer announced they no longer   required poultry to be fed on GM-free feed, following similar decisions by   Morrisons (March 2012) and Asda (September 2010). Genetically modified crops are plants where the DNA has been modified to   introduce a new trait such as the ability to withstand drought or insects.   Scientists 'cut and paste' a gene from another organism with these   capabilities and insert it into the genome of the plant. Sir Mark Walport, the government’s Chief Scientific Advisor recommended that   Britain should begin production after finding GM crops were not only safe,   but were likely to be more nutritious than current crops. GM crops are already widely used in the US, Canada, Brazil, Argentina and   India. Around 85 per cent of all corn crops in the US are now GM. But campaigners fear that disrupting the natural DNA of a plant could affect   biochemical pathways and lead to the production of unexpected toxins which   could be harmful to health. There are also concerns that GM crops may have the same impact as an invasive   alien species, damaging ecosystems. In 1999 it was suggested that GM maize,   which had been tweaked to fight pests, was killing Monarch butterflies. Pollinating plants could also transfer modified genes to weeds, boosting their   resilience and making them difficult to control. Such 'super-weeds' were discovered in Canada where cross-pollination had   occurred between GM oilseed rape plants and grasses making them immune to   herbicides. A study in 2012 suggested that herbicide-tolerant maize caused tumours and   early death in rats but the paper has since been retracted. Opponents also claim that sheep and goats are dying in India from eating   genetically modified cotton. A review of 24 studies of the health impacts of GM found there were no   significant differences between GM and non GM crops. Many scientists believe the benefits outweigh the risks. Farmers have been   changing the genetic make up of plants through breeding since agriculture   began to improve yields and make larger and hardier specimens. Currently GM crops must be passed by the EFSA and then be approved by the   Britain’s Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) – an   independent body of scientific experts. None have ever been licenced for   commercial use. "
telegraph,11/10/2010 17:24,news,"A paralysed patient has become the first person in the world to receive treatment using human embryonic stem cells in a study described as the 'dawn' of a new age of medicine.The trial on a patient with severe spinal injuries is the first to test a   treatment that has huge potential to cure disease and disability. But it is also highly controversial and considered unethical among many   Christian and 'pro-life' groups. The results of the procedure, carried out by privately funded company Geron,   will be awaited eagerly around the world by doctors and scientists working   in regenerative medicines. If a success it could be the 'catalyst' to open up stem cell   treatments for all kinds of conditions from nerve damage, to Alzheimer's   disease to diabetes. Professor Chris Mason, an expert in regenerative medicine at University   College London, said it marked the dawn of the 'Stem Cell Age'.  'This pivotal clinical trial is a major morale boost for scientists,   clinicians and most of all patients by finally commencing the transformation   of stem cells from a scientific curiosity into advanced health care,” he   said. Geron said that the patient had requested to remain anonymous and would not   release any further details, even of age and sex. However to qualify for the study, he or she must have suffered a paralysing   spinal cord injury no more than 14 days before being treated, otherwise it   would not be so effective. Millions of embryonic stem cells, which come from human embryos left over from   fertility treatments, were injected into the damage area. The hope is that they will travel to the site of a recent spinal cord injury   and transform into damaged nerve cells and help the cord regenerate. The Phase I trial, carried out at the Shepherd Centre in Atlanta, Georgia,   will not be aiming to cure patients but to establish that the cells are safe   to use and that there is no adverse side-effects. Thomas Okarma, chief executive of Geron, said in a statement it was a 'milestone   for the field of human embryonic stem cell-based therapies'.  'When we started working with human ES cells in 1999, many predicted   that it would be a number of decades before a cell therapy would be approved   for human clinical trials.' Embryonic stem cells are master cells found in human embryos, which give rise   to more than 200 specialised types of tissue in the adult body, and can be   grown into any kind of tissue to replace cells damaged by injury or disease. Use of embryonic stem cells is controversial because they must be harvested   from human embryos that are destroyed in the process. This has raised moral objections from those who believe that embryos have the   same rights as humans and see the treatment as unethical. The issue is especially acute in the US, where it has become an issue for 'pro-life'   groups. Their influence was so great that under the Bush administration there was no   federal funding for the research. A reversal in the policy under President Obama has become embroiled in legal   action. Stem-cell research is legal in Britain, where it is encouraged and funded by   the Government. However first trials are still awaiting approval. Ben Sykes, Executive Director, UK National Stem Cell Network, said: “This is   indeed a significant milestone in our journey towards the promise of stem   cell-based medicines.  'The global stem cell and regenerative medicine community will be   awaiting the results of this safety trial with much anticipation.” "
telegraph,30/11/2012 11:00,news,"A pioneering way of creating stem cells from a patient’s blood has been developed by British scientists amid hope it could lead to a new treatment for heart disease. Researchers from the University of Cambridge used the cells to build   personalised blood vessels in a method described as “patient friendly” and   efficient. In their study, published in the journal Stem Cells: Translational Medicine,   they grew the blood in a laboratory, where special stem cell type that can   be kept “long term” was isolated and stored. They say the special cells can then be turned into “any other cell in the   body”, including blood vessel cells or heart cells by using a “different   cocktails of chemicals”. Scientists can then use these cells to study disease and ultimately hope to   grow them into tissue to repair the damage caused by heart and circulatory   diseases. While the team today hailed the breakthrough as the easiest and safest source   of producing stem cells, experts have cautioned that the safety of using   such stem cells still remained unclear. 'We are excited to have developed a practical and efficient method to   create stem cells from a cell type found in blood,' said Dr Amer Rana,   who led the study. “We were able to develop a method that can be used on patients on masse.” Stem cells are one of the great hopes of medical research and can transform   into any other type of cell the body is built from. Scientists say they should be able to repair everything from the brain to the   heart, and eyes to bone. For their study, the researchers grew blood in a lab and isolated what are   known as “late outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells”. These can be stored for a significant period of time that prolongs the “use by   date” of patient samples. “This cell type grows very easily, we can keep it long term and at any time   point we can convert these cells with high efficiency into stem cells,” Dr   Rana said. They then turned them into so called “induced pluripotent stem” (iPS) cells,   which can be turned into other body cells. Scientists have struggled to find an appropriate type of cell in the blood   that can be turned into a stem cell. Often iPS cells are taken from the skin or other tissues, which can require   surgery such as a biopsy.  'Tissue biopsies are undesirable – particularly for children and the   elderly – whereas taking blood samples is routine for all patients,” said Dr   Rana. “So we wanted to take a methodology, which could really take the stem cell   technology … into the clinic in a practical way.” Dr Rana, a lecturer in Regenerative Medicine, said the “long term” aim was to   rebuild tissue in the body, including around a heart. But he said scientists could not use the technology on humans yet because   there were “several safety issues” they had to overcome. “The ultimate aim is to grow tissue … which we can use in replacement   therapies, that would be ideal,” he told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme. “That is a little way away just because we want to make sure the cells are   safe as this technology only came around five years ago in humans so it is   still early on.” “But a really important step is, rather than simple think about the technology   in a laboratory, transfer it into a clinic and make it useful for   everybody.” The British Heart Foundation said these cells had 'great potential'.   The Medical Research Council said there was 'rapid progress' being   made in the field. Both organisations funded the research. Figures show that cardiovascular disease kills more than 180,000 people in   Britain every year. "
telegraph,31/01/2005 00:01,news,"America's approved bank of human embryonic stem cells is contaminated and possibly dangerous to patients, scientists said yesterday.          The discovery marks a major setback for the United States and its efforts to dominate what many see as the next revolution in medical technology.          President George W Bush has said that embryonic stem cell research 'is at the leading edge of a series of moral hazards'.          In 2001, because of his 'deeply held beliefs', he restricted federal funding to develop new treatments to the limited numbers of embryonic stem cell lines available at that time.          Yesterday, a Californian team reported that the 'presidential' lines, from which American researchers are attempting to derive nerve, islet and other types of stem cells to repair a damaged body, have been contaminated with a non-human molecule that makes them unsafe to use in patients.          They contain a foreign substance, called N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), even though human cells are genetically unable to make it.          Prof Ajit Varki, from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, says in the journal Nature Medicine: 'We predict that, if human embryonic stem cells or their derivatives grown under the current conditions were put into living humans, there is a significant chance of a deleterious immune reaction and/or rejection of the transplanted cells.'          All traditional culture-dish methods used to grow human embryonic stem cells rely on animal-derived materials, notably foetal calf serum and 'feeder cells' from mice. This material appears to be the source of the Neu5Gc.          Experiments showed that human embryonic stem cells contaminated with Neu5Gc became, effectively, like animal cells and were attacked by human antibodies, thus rendering them useless as a potential therapeutic tool in humans.          'It's an important safety issue,' says Prof Varti's colleague, Prof Fred Gage of the Salk Institute in La Jolla.          Even when the team grew the embryonic cells in heat-inactivated human serum specially selected for low concentrations of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies, the Neu5Gc persisted.          'With this discovery, the pre-existing general concern about using animal products for deriving human embryonic stem cells has become more specific,' Prof Varki says.          Many efforts are under way, notably in Britain, to try to eliminate any animal-derived culture components or to rely on human feeder cells.          Another possibility suggested by Prof Varki is to use mouse feeder cells that have been genetically altered so they do not make Neu5Gc.          However, this still would not rule out the possibility that some other kind of contamination could occur in the future, he said.          Prof Austin Smith, Director of the Institute for Stem Cell Research, University of Edinburgh, said: 'This paper illustrates why existing cells are of limited utility and why we need to derive new human embryonic stem cell lines under better defined conditions.'          He added: 'Both Outi Hovatta in Sweden and my group are moving towards replacing serum components entirely.           'This could not be done in the US under the Bush policy.'"
telegraph,8/8/2014 14:00,news,"Brain damage caused by strokes could be repaired thanks to a new treatment which could revolutionise the treatment for the deadly condition.Thousands of lives a year could be changed thanks to the breakthrough by   Imperial College which involves injecting a patient's stem cells into their   brain. The treatment, that has been hailed as 'one of the most exciting recent   developments in stroke research', gives new hope to the 152,000 who have   strokes in Britain every year. Doctors said the procedure could become routine in ten years after larger   trials to examine its effectiveness in a wider group of patients. Hopes have been raised of a future treatment to repair the damage caused by   strokes after scientists found improvements in patients who had their own   stem cells injected into the brain. Lead author Dr Paul Bentley, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial   College London, said: 'Currently the main form of treatment is an   unblocking of the blood vessel and that only helps one third of the patients   who are treated and only ten per cent are eligible anyway. 'So we said what about the other 90 per cent?'The team targeted patients who had suffered massive strokes involving a blood   clot in the blood vessel in the middle of the brain. Typically there is a   high mortality rate in these patients and those who survive are often   severely disabled, are unable to walk, talk, feed or dress themselves. The experimental procedure was carried out on five patients aged between 40   and 70, all of whom showed improvement over the following six months and   three were living independently. More than 152,000 people suffer a stroke in England per year and the research   team said that the new procedure could eventually help most of them. Dr Madina Kara, a neuroscientist at The Stroke Association, said: “Previous   studies have shown that a type of stem cell, called CD34+ cells, shows   promise to aid stroke recovery. These latest results suggest that this type   of treatment could be administered safely and we’re looking forward to   seeing the outcomes of further studies to see exactly how they are aiding   recovery. “This is one of the most exciting recent developments in stroke research;   however, it’s still early days in stem cell research but the findings could   lead to new treatments for stroke patients in the future. 'In the UK, someone has a stroke every three and half minutes, and around   58 per cenrt of stroke survivors are left with a disability. 'One of the few existing treatments which can limit brain damage caused   by stroke is thrombolysis. However, this drug can only be used to treat   strokes caused by blood clots and must be administered within the first 4.5   hours after a stroke. There is an urgent need for alternative treatments to   help prevent the debilitating impact of stroke.'The experimental procedure involves several stages, first the patient's own   bone marrow is harvested, which was then sent to a specialist laboratory so   the specific stem cells, called CD34+ can be selected. Then the patient undergoes a procedure in which a wire is inserted into a vein   in the neck and up into the area of brain damage. Once there the stem cells   are released and the wire retracted. During the trial the whole process took half a day but it is hoped that with   refinement this could be reduced. It is thought the cells work in two ways, they grow into small blood vessels   which allow the brain to grow new nerves and brain tissue surrounding them   and also they release anti-inflammatory chemicals which encourage tissue   repair. Doctors said there are two ways the treatment could develop for use in routine   cases. The patients could do through the exact same process in the first few   days following their stroke, or the chemicals that the stem cells produce   could be recreated and administered to stroke victims when they first arrive   at hospital. Dr Paul Bentley said: 'If we find that the is the chemicals causing most   of the improvement then it would be easier to inject those.'Dr Soma Banerjee, a lead author and Consultant in Stroke Medicine at Imperial   College Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'This study showed that the   treatment appears to be safe and that it's feasible to treat patients early   when they might be more likely to benefit. 'The improvements we saw in these patients are very encouraging, but it's   too early to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of the   therapy. We need to do more tests to work out the best dose and timescale   for treatment before starting larger trials.'Professor Nagy Habib, principal investigator of the study, from the Department   of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London, said: 'These are   early but exciting data worth pursuing. 'Scientific evidence from our lab further supports the clinical findings   and our aim is to develop a drug, based on the factors secreted by stem   cells, that could be stored in the hospital pharmacy so that it is   administered to the patient immediately following the diagnosis of stroke in   the emergency room. 'This may diminish the minimum time to therapy and therefore optimise   outcome. Now the hard work starts to raise funds for this exciting research.'Dr Tim Chico, Reader in Cardiovascular Medicine at University of Sheffield and   a consultant cardiologist, said: “It is important to understand that this   study is only the very earliest step towards a possible new treatment for   stroke and does not prove the stem cell treatment improved these patients   recovery. 'A much larger trial will be needed to compare stem cell treatment with   no stem cell treatment. Anyone who has seen the suffering a stroke can cause   will be encouraged that doctors and scientists are continually exploring new   ways to treat this devastating disease. This study is only one small piece   in a very large puzzle.”Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, Head of Developmental Genetics, at the National   Institute for Medical Research, said: “This is no more than a small safety   trial, with such low numbers of patients that the authors themselves state: 'this   proof of concept study was not designed with a control group, or powered to   be able to detect efficacy'. 'Although they mention some improvement of some of the patients, this   could be just chance, or wishful thinking, or due to the special care these   patients may have received simply because they were in a trial. There is no   evidence about mechanism from pre-clinical (animal) studies and, although it   is possible that the bone marrow cells produce factors that can aid   recovery, I would prefer that further research was done on this prior to any   larger trial being initiated, even if the current work showed no adverse   effects.”"
telegraph,18/11/2008 19:23,news,"British doctors have helped to perform the world's first transplant of a whole organ grown from stem cells, signalling a significant medical breakthrough.  Surgeons replaced the damaged windpipe of Claudia Castillo, a 30-year-old   mother of two, with one created from stem cells grown in a laboratory at   Bristol University.Because the new windpipe was made from cells taken from Ms Castillo's own   body, using a process called 'tissue engineering', she has not   needed powerful drugs to prevent her body rejecting the organ.Avoiding the use of these drugs means she will not be at an increased risk of   cancer and other diseases unlike other transplant patients - another   significant advance.Five months after the operation was carried out she is now living normally and   is able to look after her children again.Stem cells are 'master cells' which can be manipulated in a   laboratory to become any other cell in the body. Scientists hailed the procedure as a breakthrough and predicted surgeons could   be regularly replacing hearts with laboratory-grown organs within 20 years. The technique would 'revolutionise' surgery, they claimed, and has   the potential to save thousands of lives.The team behind the operation hope to replicate the procedure to grow   voiceboxes within five years and say that from there the door would be open   to use the technology to create any organ including a bladder, kidney or   even a heart. Professor Martin Birchall, who grew the stem cells in his laboratory at the   University of Bristol, said: 'In 20 years' time this will be the most   common operation that surgeons are doing. This will completely revolutionise   how we think about surgery and medicine.'Although doctors were able to carry out a similar operation on a bladder two   years ago, Prof Birchall said that that had merely been a 'patch',   transferring part rather than the whole of the organ, a much less complex   task. 'This is another major step forward again,' he said. Every year more than 1,000 patients in Britain die on transplant waiting   lists, prompting scientists to consider other ways to produce organs. Ms   Castillo's operation required a section of windpipe from an organ donor as a 'scaffold'   for the stem cells - meaning the technique will not immediately solve the   shortage of donor organs. However, it is hoped that eventually artificial   scaffolds can be made which would avoid the need for donor organs completely.Without the operation, surgeons would have had to remove one of Ms Castillo's   lungs, which would have reduced her life expectancy dramatically, said Professor   Paolo Macchiarini, who performed the surgery at the Hospital Clinic,   Barcelona, in June. 'But now she can expect to have a normal life expectancy for a woman her   age,' he saidMs Castillo, who is originally from Colombia but who lives in Spain, is now   able to look after her children, walk up two flights of stairs and even   occasionally go dancing. She said: 'The possibility of avoiding the removal of my entire lung,   and, instead, replacing only my diseased bronchus with this tissue   engineering process represented a unique chance for me to return to my   normal life.'I was scared at the beginning because I was the first patient but had   confidence and trusted the doctors. I am now enjoying life and am very happy   that my illness has been cured.'After suffering from tuberculosis, she was admitetd to hospital in March of   this year with acute shortness of breath which meant that she was unable to   carry out simple domestic duties or care for her children.With the only other option available an operation to remove her left lung,   doctors decided to see if they could grow a new windpipe in the laboratory. To create the new airway scientists originally started with a donor windpipe   which they stripped of all its cells, using a new technique developed by   Padua University, leaving just a form of 'scaffold' which they   then encouraged Ms Castillo's cells to grow around. After growing a 5cm-long trachea in the lab, the scientists then carried out   the operation to transplant it into the patient. Doctors have previously been unsuccessful in attempting to transplant a   windpipe from one human to another, because the large amount of   immune-system suppressing drugs needed to ensure that the body would not   immediately reject the organ. Severe infections, bleeding and tissue death   have led to other trachea transplants failing.No such medication was needed in this case, because the airway had been grown   using the patient's own stem cells, taken from her hip and nose. Two months after the transplant, tests showed that her lung function had   returned to normal, according to the findings published in the Lancet   medical journal. Around 300 patients a year suffer from similar problems as Ms Castillo, caused   by cancer, infection or tuberculosis. Around 3,000 a year could benefit from a voicebox transplant while tens of   thousands of lives worldwide could be saved if doctors were able to   transplant hearts and other organs grown in the laboratory. Prof Macchiarini, from the University of Barcelona, said: 'We are   terribly excited by these results. After one month, a biopsy elicited local   bleeding, indicating that the blood vessels had already grown back   successfully'.Anthony Hollander, also from the University of Bristol, said: 'This   successful treatment manifestly demonstrates the potential of adult stem   cells to save lives'.Ben Sykes, from the UK National Stem Cell Network, said: 'This is an   excellent demonstration of the potential of adult stem cells as one of   several possible avenues in regenerative medicine and shows that the funding   which has been invested into, and continues to be invested into, bone marrow   stem cell research over decades is worthwhile.' John Evans, president of the British Organ Donor Society, said: 'This is   certainly science advancing at a rate of knots. It is something that has   great merit and great possibility. 'Creating organs from stem cells would also remove some of the emotional   as well as medical problems, by preventing the need to intrude upon a   recently bereaved family and their private grief.'

telegraph,2/3/2014 6:45,news,"British scientists have developed a process to grow ears and noses in a laboratory by turning stem cells from body fat into living cartilage, through tissue engineeringLifelike ears and noses could be grown in a laboratory and transplanted into   humans using a technique developed by British scientists.Researchers from Great Ormond Street Hospital and University College London   have become the first to turn stem cells from body fat in the abdomen of   children into living cartilage, through tissue engineering.This ground-breaking procedure could help young patients who are born with   debilitating facial abnormalities, such as  'microtia’, where the outer ear   is underdeveloped, or those who require reconstructive surgery after an   accident.Experts believe it could ultimately be utilised in many other types of   transplant surgery, to help reduce the risk of the body rejecting a   replacement organ.Currently, when facial features of children with severe birth defects need to   be rebuilt, surgeons have to take cartilage from other parts of the body,   such as the ribs, which is an invasive and painful procedure. Then they fashion the shape of a nose or an ear by hand, before placing this   'scaffold’ under the skin of a patient.However, using the new technique, doctors would simply be able to 'grow’ a new   ear or nose from scratch that would ultimately be biologically   indistinguishable from the real thing.To achieve the breakthrough, researchers took stem cells from a child’s   abdominal fat and then combined them with a polymer 'nano-scaffold’ – almost   a microscopic netting.They then managed to manipulate this composite in a laboratory so that human   cartilage tissue grew into the tiny holes within the polymer.The technique could now be used to help treat a number of conditions. For   patients with 'microtia’ for example, the stem cells that make the cartilage   tissue could be placed in a mould so that it grew into the shape of an ear.This 'cartilage ear frame’ would then be inserted under a flap of skin on a   patient’s head which would mould around the shape. When a biodegradable   polymer scaffold is used, it would dissolve over time, leaving only human   cartilage present.Although it would not help with other functions, such as hearing, the ear   would be biologically indistinguishable from a real outer ear.A paper on the new technique has now been published in the Journal   Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine. Neil Bulstrode,   Consultant Plastic Surgeon, at Great Ormond Street Hospital, one of the   authors of the research, said: “It is such an exciting prospect with regard   to the future treatment of these patients and many more.“Currently I take the rib cartilage from the chest to make an ear. I carve a   framework in the shape of an ear. Then I will place that framework in a   pocket under the skin, which is sucked down with a vacuum so that the skin   conforms to the contours of the ear framework.“But if we could produce a block of cartilage using stem cells and tissue   engineering, this would be the Holy Grail for our field.”The research could also have far wider reaching implications for the future of   transplants.Significant advances have been made since the first synthetic tracheal   transplant was carried out in 2011 using a plastic windpipe that was coated   in stem cells. Development of the new technique means that a trachea could   be created from cartilage made from a patient’s own fat stem cells making   rejection unlikely and lessening the need for drugs to suppress the immune   systemIn the Nanomedicine paper, the authors said the procedure could ultimately   “help to improve stability, integration and functionality of engineered   transplants while avoiding tissue rejection.“In addition to auricular (ear) and nasal (nose) cartilage reconstruction they   could be used for example to improve the quality of tracheal transplants.”The technique harvests 'mesenchymal’ stem cells from abdominal fat, which can   turn into cartilage cells. Ultimately, the scientists believe it could be   used to create bone and other types of tissue.Dr Patrizia Ferretti, Head of Developmental Biology at UCL, said the technique   was particularly useful for children.“One of the main benefits is that, because they are the patient’s own cells,   you don’t have to do any immune suppression which would not be desirable for   a sick child,” she said. “At the moment we take cartilage out of the ribs which means a major   additional surgical procedure that creates a permanent defect, as the rib   cartilage does not regrow. But with this technique you could seed the stem   cells onto a mould of a healthy ear, or use 3D printing to make the ear   shaped scaffold-containing cells that can then be turned into cartilage.   That would reduce the number of severe procedures hence be greatly   advantageous for the child.“This is just step one, we have just shown proof of principle that cartilage   can be made from children stem cells on a clinically approved biomaterial,   but we haven’t yet made a complete ear with a related material that is   biodegradable, but I am hopeful we will in the not too distant future.”This new approach could also allow children to have facial reconstructive   surgery earlier. At the moment surgeons have to wait until the child’s ribs   have grown enough to provide sufficient cartilage for reconstructing the   ear. But Dr Ferretti said: “Our goal is that over time the synthetic   component of the grafted ear would disappear and the grafted tissue will   continue to grow with the child.”For patients like Sam Clompus, 15, of Bristol, who suffers from 'microtia’, it   would mean that one simpler operation could have restored his ear. Sam was   born with just a nub where his right outer ear should have been.“Growing up, at times he was self-conscious,” said mother Sue, 50, a senior   lecturer in nursing .“Lots of people used to stare at him which made him feel uncomfortable. Most   of his childhood he had longer hair to cover it but when he went to   secondary school he wanted his hair short so then it was more noticeable.“His schools have always been supportive, he was just known as the kid with   the funny little ear, and everyone got on with it.“When he was younger they offered Sam a prosthetic ear but we thought that was   a bit too Frankenstein.“We had looked at other options over the past few years.

telegraph,15/02/2001 00:00,news,"BY comparing our genetic instructions with those of other creatures, scientists can begin to explain why we alone, of all the species on the planet, can organise our thoughts to investigate our own existence.                                Click to enlarge           Scientists have compiled the entire genetic complement, or genome, of about 60 species and this is likely to rise to around 100 within months. Comparison of these genomes with our genetic sequence can shed light on what it means to be human.Equally, the discovery that we share great chunks of genetic code with creatures such as worms, flies, weeds and mice, shows how we are all descendants of a single organism that emerged four billion years ago: this is firm proof for the theories of Charles Darwin, said Sir John Sulston of the Sanger Centre, near Cambridge.'It is the unity of life, or Nature being conservative, or the idea of the Blind Watchmaker - the notion of evolution as a constant reworking or random recombining of parts,' said Sir John. 'You convert your Austin 7 into a Mercedes, but basically it's the same underneath.'When it comes to human diversity, the genetic variance that separates Britney Spears from an Aborigine are tiny. Biological differences boil down to differences in 1,000-10,000 genetic letters of the three billion-letter code, estimated Dr Craig Venter of Celera Genomics. What makes us human? The Celera team compared our genetic code with that of a fruit fly. 'We describe four or five major lineages of genes that have expanded that we think allowed or drove the vertebrates' explosion that led to our existence,' he said.Flies lack genes associated with the immune system, that protects us from infection, and the genes associated with a circulatory system. The molecular machinery that controls programmed cell death appears to be much more complex in humans than the insects.The human genome, as compared with the worm and fly genomes, contains a marked increase in the number of members of protein families that are involved in nerve cell connections, such as proteins called semaphorins that help the brain wire up. Humans have 22 semaphorins, compared with six in the fly and two in the worm.The human genome also has a marked increase in the protein families that are involved in nerve cell development. This accounts for why there are as many as a thousand or more different types of nerve cell in humans, compared with a few hundreds in fly and worm.Most significant, we have more 'control genes'. While genes associated with DNA and regulation make up eight per cent of the fly code, they represent as much as 12 per cent of the human code.Humans have greater complexity when it comes to 'zinc fingers', zinc-containing proteins that bind to DNA and control how the genome is read in our cells, so that a liver cell is different from a brain cell. Prof Michael Green's team from the University of Massachusetts and colleagues in Italy concluded: 'The increased complexity of the human gene expression machinery implies that gene expression may be particularly important in shaping human development and physiology.' Why we are like humble creatures The comparison of our genome with those of a fruit fly and nematode worm reveals we also have much in common. Celera found that there are 2,758 genes that we share with the fly, and 2,031 with the worm. All three share 1,523 genes.In all, around 10 per cent of the genes in humans are clearly related to particular genes in the fly and the worm. When it comes to rodents, Dr Venter said: 'We found only 100-300 genes in the human genome that don't seem to have a counterpart in the mouse genome.'A similar exercise by the public project pointed out that the proteins we share with these other creatures are mostly responsible for important 'housekeeping' functions of the cell, such as machinery to process DNA, enzymes involved in metabolism, cell cycle regulators, and chaperone proteins that play a role in helping proteins to fold into the correct shape, which is crucial for them to work properly.The molecular machinery we share with other creatures provides a glimpse of the cellular processes that were at work in the last common ancestor of the human, fly and worm, which lived some 700 million years ago. These similarities 'will be both a source of humility and awe of nature, and a blow to the idea of human uniqueness', commented Prof Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany."
dailymail,13/05/2015 06:00,wires,"By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO, May 13 (Reuters) - Drug manufacturers have begunamassing enormous troves of human DNA in hopes of significantlyshortening the time it takes to identify new drug candidates, amove some say is transforming the development of medicines.The efforts will help researchers identify rare geneticmutations by scanning large databases of volunteers who agree tohave their DNA sequenced and to provide access to detailedmedical records.It is made possible by the dramatically lower cost ofgenetic sequencing - it took government-funded scientists $3billion and 13 years to sequence the first human genome by 2003.As of last year, the cost was closer to $1,500 per genome, downfrom $20,000 five years ago.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which signed a dealwith Pennsylvania's Geisinger Health System in January 2014 tosequence partial genomes of some 250,000 volunteers, is alreadyclaiming discoveries based on the new approach. Companyexecutives told Reuters they have used data from the first35,000 volunteers to confirm the promise of 250 genes on a listof targets for drugs aimed at common medical conditions,including high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.Regeneron says it has also identified 'several dozen' newgene targets, including a novel gene that plays a role inobesity.Pfizer Inc, Roche Holding AG and Biogen Inc are working on similar projects that use DNA andpatient health data to find new drug targets or predict theeffects of drugs.Their investments have been inspired by early successes incancer with drugs such as Pfizer's lung cancer treatmentXalkori, which was approved in 2011 and targets mutations intumors driving the disease. More recently, VertexPharmaceuticals has changed the treatment of cysticfibrosis with Kalydeco, which targets the disease's underlyinggenetic cause.'All of a sudden, it all opened up,' as companies recognizethe potential for drugs targeting genetic glitches, Dr. EricTopol, a genomics expert at the Scripps Translational ScienceInstitute. 'It's starting to really become a new preferred modelfor drug development.'In the past, discovering such genes was a painstakingprocess, often involving years of research into isolatedpopulations. In 1991, for example, researchers discovered a raremutation in a gene called Angptl3 that caused very low levels ofartery-clogging cholesterol and triglycerides among families inthe remote Italian village of Campodimele.It took nearly two more decades and several groups ofscientists to fully understand the potential cardiovascularbenefits linked to mutations in that gene.Since last autumn, the Regeneron Genetics Center hassequenced the DNA of more than 35,000 Geisinger patients and ison track to sequence 100,000 by year end. Already, the companyhas identified 100 people carrying similar cholesterol-affectingmutations to those first observed in Campodimele and elsewhere.'You no longer have to find that one rare family in Italy,because it's just in the database,' said Dr. George Yancopoulos,chief scientific officer of Regeneron.PRECISION MEDICINEIdentifying target genes is just a first step, though, anddoes not guarantee that a drug can be developed on a geneticlead, or that it will ultimately be safe and effective enough tobe used.Experts also differ on approach. Regeneron is sequencingexomes, the protein-making genes that comprise 1 to 2 percent ofthe genome, a search that costs roughly $700 per person. Othersfavor looking at the whole genome, which costs the $1,500 perperson.Craig Venter, one of the first scientists to sequence thehuman genome, believes the whole genome approach will be moremeaningful over time.'I'd rather have a gold mine with a deep vein of gold andmodern industrial equipment to mine it rather than sitting therewith a pan in a stream looking for gold,' he said. 'Both willfind gold. It's a question of how much you find.'Even so, the early returns from new 'genomic' medicines haveattracted attention from the White House. In January, PresidentBarack Obama said he would seek $130 million from Congress togather genetic data from 1 million volunteers as part of a'precision medicine' initiative.Regeneron is lobbying for the Geisinger database to become acornerstone of that effort, and proposes creating a consortiumof drugmakers to fund it. In return, Yancopoulos said, thecompany hopes to recoup some of its investment.Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes ofHealth, which is in charge of the precision medicine project,identified Regeneron among a short list of potentialcontributors to the 1 million-strong DNA study. Others on thelist include Kaiser Permanente, Mayo Clinic, and the MarshfieldClinic in Wisconsin. A decision is expected by earlyfall.For drug companies, the lure of a big payoff is strong.Regeneron and its partner Sanofi are expected to soonwin regulatory approval for a cholesterol-lowering drug thatworks by blocking the PCSK9 gene. Amgen and Pfizer havedeveloped similar treatments.Individuals born with non-functioning versions of PCSK9 havevery low cholesterol. The new drugs mimic that effect and areconsidered a poster child for treatments that take advantage ofglitches in the genome that prove beneficial to the rareindividuals who carry them. Wall Street analysts projectRegeneron/Sanofi's PCSK9 drug will generate revenues of $4.4billion by 2019.MINING THE DATAAmgen bolstered its search for gene targets by buying DecodeGenetics in late 2012 for $415 million, giving it a database ofcomplete genetic sequences of 2,636 Icelanders. The communityshares a relatively homogenous genetic profile due to itsgeographic isolation, allowing researchers to identify genevariations more easily.In March, Amgen reported the discovery of a new mutationthat increases the risk of Alzheimer's and confirmed the role oftwo mutations involved in diabetes and atrial fibrillation.This past January, Roche's Genentech unit tapped Venter'sHuman Longevity Inc for a large sequencing project.Genetic testing company 23andMe announced deals this yearwith Genentech and Pfizer. Genentech will have access to 3,000individuals in 23andMe's community of Parkinson's patients, andPfizer will expand an existing collaboration with the company tostudy the genetics of lupus.That same month, Biogen formed a $30 million researchalliance to support the formation of a sequencing center atColumbia University.'All of the companies are feeling like, 'Oh my gosh. We haveto do something substantial in genomics - yesterday,'' said Dr.David Goldstein, director of Columbia's Institute for GenomicMedicine.At the heart of Regeneron's model is finding rare mutationsthat disable normal gene function. So far, it has identifiedpeople with at least one such 'loss-of-function' gene thatcorrelates with nearly all 250 genes on the company's list ofdrug targets.That includes essentially every gene previously linked totriglyceride regulation and several novel candidates,Yancopoulos said. They have done the same for cholesterol andcoronary artery disease.Regeneron has also partnered with academic centers studyingfamilies with extreme genetic disorders, collaborations thatalready have led to the discovery of a couple of dozen newcandidate genes, said Dr. Aris Baras, who runs Regeneron'sgenetics center.In one case, they are using the Geisinger database to studya rare gene they believe causes severe obesity in youngchildren. The team has found milder mutations in the overallpopulation that may cause an average 10-pound weight gain inadults. That would validate the role that such genes play inregulating body weight and suggests that, 'if you had a drug itcould have a profound effect,' Yancopoulos said.'This is why everybody is excited about it,' he said.

telegraph,10/6/2003 0:01,news,"By Roger Highfield, Science Editor A licence to work with human eggs in an experiment that prepares the way for the first human cloning in Britain has been issued to the Roslin Institute in Scotland, home of Dolly the sheep.The licence to carry out human parthenogenesis - Greek for 'virgin birth' - will provide insights into how to boost the supply of human eggs for fertility treatments and help refine plans to use cloning to create stem cells from a patient's own tissue for research and treatments for a vast range of diseases.The Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority, granted the licence, the first for parthenogenesis, to the creator of Dolly, Prof Ian Wilmut, who was yesterday abroad and unavailable for comment.Most plants can multiply by parthenogenesis and so do all fungi and many animals, such as corals. Parthenogenesis is impossible for humans, however, because a process called imprinting means that human embryos need maternal and paternal genes to develop. But it is possible to use a shock of electricity or chemicals to make a human egg divide for a few days, as a parthenogenetic embryo, before dying.The Roslin now wants to make parthenogenetic human embryos to test if its attempts to ripen immature human eggs, such as those in ovarian tissue, have been successful. Success will be important to address the shortage of human eggs for research on cloning of human embryos, which could provide stem cells from individual patients for the study of serious genetic disease or even for novel treatments.A better understanding of how to encourage eggs to mature in the laboratory may also help women undergoing IVF treatment, notably those suffering from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, when their eggs do not mature properly. Armed with understanding of how best to mature eggs in the laboratory, Roslin will find it easier to get permission for a proposal it is developing to clone human embryos to produce stem cells for treatments.Suzi Leather, the HFEA chairman, said: 'After careful consideration of all the scientific, ethical and medical aspects of the project, the HFEA Licence Committee agreed to grant an initial one-year research licence to the Roslin Institute.'"
telegraph,21/05/2004 00:01,news,"By Roger Highfield, Science EditorThe first deposits are to be made in a unique bank, the world's first to store cells isolated from early human embryos.          Medical researchers believe the bank will give Britain a lead in the race to develop new treatments for a broad spectrum of diseases. In contrast, the bank is greeted with revulsion by 'pro-life' activists.          The country's first two stem cell lines from human embryos, developed separately by Dr Stephen Minger and Dr Susan Pickering at King's College London, and Prof Tom Strachan and Prof Alison Murdoch at the Centre for Life, Newcastle, are to be deposited when the bank is opened by Lord Warner, the health minister.          Human embryonic stem cells have rarely been out of the headlines since they were first isolated in 1998 by a team in Wisconsin. The cells have the potential to turn into any of the 200 different types in the body, offering huge potential to repair a patient damaged by illness, accident or disease.          Once warmed and grown at blood temperature in nutrients and growth factors, the stem cells will initially be used to find ways to reliably turn them into the desired cell type.          A huge amount of research is needed to understand exactly how they work and how their potential can be harnessed.          Transforming stem cells remains a distant prospect but these cells alone could revolutionise the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, stroke, spinal cord injuries, heart disease and diabetes.          The bank is funded by the Medical Research Council and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, hosted by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, South Mimms, and will also hold stem cell lines from foetal and adult tissues.          Applications to deposit stem cell lines or to withdraw banked stem cell lines must be reviewed and authorised by a committee chaired by Lord Naren Patel.          The embryos used for the research look like a hollow ball, barely visible to the human eye. Within them are 25 or so cells, the 'inner cell mass' containing the stem cells that form the embryo. From the inner mass, the lines of stem cells have been grown.          However, the feat has proved extraordinarily difficult: researchers have to guard against infection, contamination or colonies changing into nerve or other tissue. Deposition in the bank ensures that maximum use will be made of as few human embryos as possible."
telegraph,19/05/2013 07:00,news,"Checks for predisposition to disease, such as the one that led actress Angelina Jolie to undergo a double mastectomy, are now common, but so are fears for what might come next.'It does feel like a scene out of a science-fiction film.” These were the   words Angelina Jolie used to describe surgery she had after being found to   carry a gene that predisposed her to developing breast cancer.Genetic tests had allowed doctors to spot an inherited mutation in her DNA   that increased her risk of the disease by 87 per cent. The same genetic   fault also increased her risk of ovarian cancer by 50 per cent.Less than a day after Jolie’s revelation, scientists announced another   potential breakthrough: the prospect of using human cloning to provide new   treatments was now a step closer.In the US, technology used to develop Dolly   the Sheep had been successfully adapted to create cloned human embryos. These could provide a rich source of stem cells to make heart muscle, livers   and brain tissue in the future. It raises hopes that patients will be able   to have new organs and replacement tissue grown from their own cells.But does this mean we are about to enter a brave new world where patients can   replace parts of their body at will and spot diseases long before they take   effect?The reality is sobering. “Ten to 15 years ago we thought that we would be   using genetic tests to predict all sorts of diseases,” said Prof Tim   Spector, a genetic epidemiologist at King’s College London. “It turns out to   have been wishful thinking.“We used to think there might be five to 10 genes involved in a disease, but   we now know there may be thousands that only contribute a tiny amount and   interact with each other.”It was hoped that the £1.8 billion human genome project to decipher our DNA   would herald a new age in medicine when it was completed 13 years ago.   Instead, it revealed that our genetic make up is far more complicated than   we had expected.None the less, scientists have now developed tests for about 2,500 diseases,   but almost all are for rare conditions and only a fifth are treatable.   Examples include  Huntingdon’s Disease and Cystic Fibrosis.However, scientists who worked on the human genome project are now striving to   unravel the web of genes that play a role in more widespread conditions   including obesity, diabetes and autism.They are analysing the genomes of more than 10,000 people from around the UK   who suffer from a range of diseases.Their results are already identifying   genes that have weak effects in serious and common conditions.“These may not be useful as a test in themselves,” said Dr Jeff Barrett, group   leader on the UK10K project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. “But   they will help us understand more about these diseases. This can give us   clues about how to develop treatments and to develop new ways of screening.”Also on the horizon are new tests for, diabetes, early-onset Alzheimer’s   disease and colon cancer, which may help doctors provide treatments to slow   them or prevent them from occurring.Tests for obesity genes can also present people with the option of changing   their behaviour and diet to reduce their chances of becoming obese.Simultaneously, the development of genetic tests is also resulting in a   growing ethical and moral debate about how they should be used. By providing   seemingly healthy individuals with a warning that they may suffer from an   illness later in their life, doctors are also offering them the chance to   prevent it.“There are questions we need to be thinking about as new technologies enter   mainstream use,” said Prof Anneka Lucassen, a clinical geneticist at the   University of Southampton and a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics.“Unlike an X-ray where you might find a tumour that needs dealing with now,   with genetic testing you are predicting something that could happen in 10 or   20 years’ time. If you predict a genetic disease with any certainty, you are   also potentially predicting something about their relatives who have not   asked for the test. Should their relatives be told that they might also be   at risk?” Dr Helen Wallace, from the campaign group Genewatch, warns that tests could   see some patients placed on medication or having surgery when it is   unnecessary. “There is a lot of industry interest in using tests to market   medication to people on the basis that they are at a higher than average   risk.”There is also concern over tests  being offered by private companies. For   around £100, it is possible to obtain a health report based on your DNA   simply by providing a small sample of spit.Companies such as 23andMe, DeCODEme and Pathway provide a report on a person’s   risk of several hundred conditions and more than 40 heritable   diseases.However, results can be confusing and increase anxieties by failing   to explain the risk clearly. Daniel MacArthur, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, added: “The   technology is still young, so people should be prepared both for errors in   data, and for challenges in interpretation.”Similarly, the ethics surrounding human cloning are the subject of passionate   debate. T he technique revealed last week by the Oregon Health and Science   University involves the destruction of human embryos, which pro-life   campaigners find unacceptable.The technology is also notoriously inefficient   and can require hundreds of attempts to successful clone an embryo.For many, however, a more worrying development is the prospect of producing   cloned babies – or “reproductive cloning” – even though laws in many   developed countries, including the UK, strictly forbid such practices.Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, from the UK National Institute for Medical Research,   said attempts to clone a human would almost certainly fail. “It is an unsafe   procedure in animals and it will similarly be an unsafe procedure in humans.”Indeed, there is strong evidence that any cloned baby would be a   disappointment to anyone hoping to inflict a copy of themselves on the   world. Research  shows that although they would be genetically identical,   there is a second layer of information that is overlaid on our DNA that is   influenced by our environment.“It is like a dimmer switch, turning genes on and off to varying degrees,”   explained Prof Tim Spector, the author of Identically Different.This new level of information, known as our epigenome, is now thought to be   one of the main ways the environment we grow up in, the food we eat, what we   drink, our stress levels and even what our parents do can influence our   genes. It is the “nurture” to the “nature” of our DNA.Prof Spector said: “A clone is likely to be far more different than identical   twins are as the lab environment where they were created can affect the   epigenome too.”In fact, this extra information with the potential to confound any would-be   cloners could also provide a new solution to those hoping to find answers   about future disease risk in our DNA.The epigenome is caused by removable chemical changes to the DNA that   influences how it is used by our cells.“We can now measure the epigenome and a study we did last year looked at 30   pairs of twins – one with breast cancer and one without. We found epigenetic   changes on tumour-related genes five years before someone is diagnosed.“This means we could use this as a predictor of disease. If someone has a   BRCA1 mutation, for example, they may not develop the disease as it can   depend on their lifestyle and environment in ways we don’t understand.“The lesson from our research is that someone could have a blood test every   year to look for the epigenetic changes that warn that their disease is   developing.”If Prof Spector proves to be correct, genetic testing could be transformed. Women such as Angelina Jolie would no longer be faced with the agonising   decision of removing their breasts in surgery to prevent a disease they may   never get. Instead, they could combine knowledge about their genes with regular   monitoring of their epigenome to provide an early warning.Already a couple of tests for colon cancer that look at the epigenome are   under development while research is under way on others.So perhaps we are seeing science fiction becoming reality after all. Only time   will tell."
telegraph,11/9/2013 18:00,news,"Damaged and diseased organs could eventually be regenerated inside the bodies of living patients following a breakthrough by scientists. Researchers have successfully reprogrammed adult cells in a living animal for   the first time, creating stem cells that have the ability to grow into any   tissue found in the body. Until now these stem cells, known as induced pluripotent stem cells, have only   ever been created in Petri dishes in the laboratory after being removed from   the animal. However, researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre in Madrid,   Spain, were able to create these cells in the bodies of living mice. They found that they could reprogram adult cells from the kidney, stomach,   intestine and pancreas using a cocktail of “reprogramming factors”. It raises the hope that damaged organs could be repaired in patients by   reprogramming some of their own adult cells and then encouraging them to   generate new tissue. However, Dr Manuel Serrano, who led the research which is published in the   journal Nature, said it would be at least five years before the first   clinical trials to reprogram adult cells in human patients. He said: “The main surprise of our work is that it is possible to generate   pluripotent stem cells directly in the tissue in living organisms. “We can imagine that transitory reprogramming could help in the natural   regeneration of damaged tissue. “In principal we hope that it could help to repair any kind of damage like in   the heart, brain or liver, but we have still to find which will respond   best.” The research, which is published in the journal Nature,   used genetically modified mice that carried a gene cassette that caused them   to produce the reprogramming factors. They were given a drug in their drinking water that turned the genes on and   caused the reprogramming factors to be released, leading to the development   of induced pluripotent stem cells that were similar to the stem cells found   in the early stages of a developing embryo. These have the capacity to develop into almost any other tissue found in the   body, although the scientists have still to show that this can occur inside   the mice. In patients, such reprogramming could be targeted by injecting the factors at   a local site. However, creating inducted pluripotent stem cells in the body also carries   risks as they also have the ability to develop into cancer cells. Dr Serrano said they would have to do more research to establish how they   could control the development of the reprogrammed cells so they did not   produce tumours. Prof. Chris Mason, an expert in regenerative medicine at University College   London, added that the reprogrammed cells would also need to be guided to   ensure they developed into the right sort of tissue within the body. He said: The cells that will be useful will not be the pluripotent stem cells,   but their more specialised 'adult' offspring. “This is an interesting proof of concept of the first step in the process, but   it still needs these induced pluripotent stem cells to be safely converted   to useful 'adult' cell types in the body. “The major challenge will be tightly controlling every step in this potential   approach to treating patients in order to deliver clinical benefits whilst   avoiding significant complications.'

telegraph,1/5/2014 6:30,news,"Damaged hearts of macaque monkeys were regenerated in just a few weeks after scientists injected human stem cells into the organs A cure for heart failure could be just a few years away after scientists   successfully regenerated the damaged hearts of primates using human stem   cells. The breakthrough, which was hailed as ‘very significant’ by British experts,   will be tested on humans within four years. If successful it would mean that even people who are bed-bound with heart   failure could be 'up and about' again within a few weeks. More than 750,000 people in Britain are living with heart failure, where the   organ is too damaged to pump blood efficiently. It is a hugely debilitating   condition and can bring early death. Researchers found that damaged hearts of seven macaque monkeys could be   repaired by up to 40 per cent by injecting human stem cells directly into   the organ. “It shows for the first time that we can do regeneration at a scale that the   world has never seen before,” said Dr Charles Murry, professor of pathology   and bioengineering, at the University of Washington. 'Before this study, it was not known if it is possible to produce   sufficient numbers of these cells and use them to re-muscularise damaged   hearts in a large animal whose heart size and physiology is similar to that   of the human heart.'“We’ve shown that (stem cells) will survive and they will organise to form new   heart muscle and they will connect with the surrounding cardiac muscle cells   and beat in synchrony.”The green area shows the regenerated heart muscle Currently heart muscle cannot be repaired and people with severe heart failure   must wait for a heart transplant. In the study the team induced heart attacks, in anesthetised macaque monkeys. Over the course of two weeks they injected one billion heart muscle cells   derived from human embryonic stem cells. The researchers found that the stem cells infiltrated into the damaged heart   tissue, matured, and knitted into muscle fibers, before beginning to beat in   rhythm with the macaque heart cells. After three months, the cells had fully integrated into the heart. On average   the transplanted stem cells regenerated 40 percent of the damaged heart   tissue and improve the ability of the heart to pump blood. Although the study has been carried out on macaque monkeys, the researchers at   the University of Washington said 'the approach should be feasible in   humans'.“The results show we can now produce the number of cells needed for human   therapy and get formation of new heart muscle on a scale that is relevant to   improving the function of the human heart,' said Dr Michael Laflamme,   assistant professor of biology at the University of Washington. Although some of the monkeys had irregular heartbeats the scientists believe   this could be prevented by allowing the stem cells to mature more before   they are transplanted. “This is really good research and potentially very significant,” said Chris   Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University College London. “Although a 40 per cent improvement might not seem like a lot, you actually   only need a couple of per cent to make a difference to someone’s quality of   life. “So this would be the equivalent of a bed-bound person being able to walk to   the shops again within a few days or weeks. It would have a substantial   impact on quality of life. “It may be that this treatment would actually work better in humans because   the monkeys in the study had to be given immunosuppressant treatment because   the stem cells were human.”The study was also welcomed by charities. Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation,   said: “This research brings us one step closer to repairing a damaged human   heart, but we still have some way to go until we reach our goal. “Researchers showed that heart cells derived from human stem cells in a   laboratory can survive and function alongside normal heart cells inside a   damaged monkey heart. “But these results demonstrate encouraging progress.

It will take   us decades to understand all 3bn base pairs in the human genome, but today   we already know what thousands of important genetic differences mean for   individuals.We know that genes affect your risk for conditions like cystic fibrosis and   breast cancer, and we know how your genes affect your responses to drugs   like Warfarin. As genetic testing becomes more affordable, more people can   benefit from understanding their genetics and use that understanding to   improve their health, help them prevent the harmful side-effects of some   drugs and potentially avoid preventable deaths.For example, roughly 8 per cent of people with European ancestry have a   genetic variant that puts them at higher than average risk for blood clots.   There are a number of easy ways to minimize this risk, ranging from avoiding   oral contraceptives to staying hydrated and maintaining mobility during   airplane flights.  Read the article   in full.From Huffingon Post – Personal Genomics for AllThere's a challenge here that's going to be extremely important to the   healthcare community in the coming years, as probabilistic genomic data   becomes the basis for more and more decisions people have to make about drug   regimens or even elective surgery. To date, this type of data has always   been communicated through an intermediary. In the future, it's likely to be   available directly.From the Times – Why the gene revolution was postponedSo far, genomics has generated more questions than answers. Fascinating,   wonderful, exciting questions – about how genes interact with each   other, about the role of the long stretches of “non-coding” DNA in between   the genes, about the effects of having too many or too few copies of a gene,   about changes in the genes that can happen during an individual lifetime.These complications couldn’t have been anticipated by the pioneers who   launched the Human Genome Project. But the complexity has taken the gloss   off the promise of an instant medical revolution. To make things worse, in   the ten years since completion of the project, the pharmaceutical industry –   the other bulwark of the promised pharmacogenomics revolution – has   plunged ever deeper into a crisis that threatens to turn off the tap of all   new medicines.Read the article   in full.From Nature – Medical genomics: Gather and use genetic data in health careTo translate genetic analysis into improved medical care, hospital executives   and other leaders must redesign how they collect and manage data so that it   can be used in research. Existing patient databases for clinical care are   often inadequate for evaluating health interventions: data are frequently   missing or incorrect, and it can be hard to link data about, for example,   demographics, appointments, procedures, medications and vital signs.Pioneers of learning health-care systems have established streamlined   consenting processes and data warehouses... However, systems are not   consistently incentivised to build these capacities. Health leaders want   evidence before investing resources, yet without those investments, such   evidence is hard to gather.Read the article   in full."
telegraph,9/9/2002 12:09,news,"Europe's first stem cell bank could be up and running in the UK within a year.The Medical Research Council said that the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control had been awarded the £2.6 million contract to set up and run the UK Stem Cell Bank.It will be based in Hertfordshire and hold stem cells, which are 'mother cells' capable of developing into different kinds of tissue, from both embryos and adults.Doctors hope that tissue made from stem cells can help treat conditions such as Parkinson's disease and diabetes.The NIBSC is a Government-funded organisation set up to safeguard and improve public health by standardising and controlling biological substances used in medicine.NIBSC director Dr Stephen Inglis said that there was no firm timetable for when the bank would be up and running. But he said: 'I would hope we will be in a position to start receiving cells within a year.'The bank, which has been given ministerial approval, is the first of its kind in Europe and Dr Inglis said the UK was leading the way in this area of research.He said the bank would make stem cell lines widely available for use by the research community, ensure samples were of high quality and reduce the need for fresh tissue to be found.The research was strictly regulated and material going in and out of the bank would be strictly controlled.'The Institute has a long history of producing and controlling biological reference materials,' he said. 'We are a World Health Organisation laboratory for standards and so the public can be reassured.'The contract will be managed by the MRC, which will also fund the bank, along with the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. A steering committee will develop a code of practice for the bank and regulate the use of embryonic stem cell lines.Health minister Lord Hunt said: 'I am pleased to be able to welcome today's announcement about the MRC stem cell bank at NIBSC. The stem cell bank will be first of its kind in Europe and will ensure that the UK retains its international position in this exciting field which promises to bring a revolution in healthcare.'He said there would be a long period of research work on stem cells and the bank would be of great benefit to this."
telegraph,8/5/2011 8:10,news,"Europe's largest stem cell clinic, which is at the centre of a scandal over the death of a baby given an injection into the brain, has been shut down. The closure of the XCell-Center in Dusseldorf follows an undercover   investigation by The Sunday Telegraph into its controversial   practices, which attracted hundreds of patients from the UK. The clinic   charged patients up to £20,000 for stem cell injections into the back and   brain despite a lack of scientific proof that the treatments actually worked.Experts in stem cell research had accused the clinic of preying on vulnerable   patients, desperately seeking a cure for such illnesses and diseases as   cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, autism, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart   disease, diabetes and spinal cord injuries.While most other European countries - as well as the US, Canada and Australia   - have banned stem cell treatments unless shown to be safe and effective,   XCell had exploited a loophole in German law allowing it to charge for the   experimental procedures.But last week, the clinic suddenly announced it had ceased carrying out   operations due to what it described as legal changes in Germany.   In a posting on its website, XCell said last week: 'Due to a new   development in German law, stem cell therapy is currently not possible to   perform at the XCell-Center. Regretfully for this reason, we must cancel   your appointment until further notice. We will notify you for further   updates about the matter.'The clinic had come under increasing scrutiny following the death of an   18-month-old boy in August last year, in a case first revealed by The   Sunday Telegraph. The child, who was from Romania, was injected in the   brain with stem cells but suffered internal bleeding. Three months earlier,   a boy aged 10 from Azerbaijan had almost died when the same procedure went   wrong. The doctor who carried out the operation remains under criminal   investigation.The Sunday Telegraph now understands that following this newspaper's   report in October, German authorities decided to re-examine the legality of   the XCell operation. The centre had previously had permission to practice   for a transitional period because it was already up and running when a law   came into force in 2009 banning the commercial exploitation of unproven stem   cell treatments.It appears German authorities have now decided to close the loophole with   immediate effect. They deny the law has changed and sources suggested they   decided abruptly to re-interpret it instead. A spokesman for the Paul-Ehrlich Institute, which regulates medicines in   Germany, said: 'The situation is very complicated but the law on stem   cell treatments has not changed. However we welcome the news that the   XCell-Center is not accepting any more cases.'Ira Hermann, who runs the German stem cell network which funds scientific   research projects, said: 'XCell was offering unproven treatments and   taking a lot of money from very vulnerable people.'Professor Chris Mason, chair of regenerative medicine at University College   London, said: 'This is excellent news for the European cell therapy   industry. XCell had failed to demonstrate its treatments were either safe   and effective or had scientific rationale.'The clinic's sudden closure has taken would-be patients by surprise and left   them confused. Some have been told the shut down is temporary and others   that it is permanent. They had pinned their hopes on the promise of possible   success for currently incurable illnesses. On a Facebook page, one Australian patient posted: 'Could you please tell   me the approximate waiting list after sending the deposit. We sent the   deposit more than two weeks ago and have not heard back even after emailing.   We have also called the clinic and left messages for our contact to get back   to us to no avail. We are getting a little worried.'Carol Walmsley, who lives in the Isle of Man, had hosted a charity night for   her son Chris, quadriplegic after a car accident, only last Sunday. Raising   the £15,000 needed for his treatment, she telephoned the XCell the following   day only to be told the clinic was no longer accepting patients.'It devastated me,' said Mrs Walmsley, 'They said they were   cancelling all operations because they were unable to make any appointments.   They said they were booking a meeting with the German government to sort   this out. They told me they were fairly confident but there were no   guarantees.'The XCell clinic treated about 25 patients a year from the UK in state of the   art facilities in Dusseldorf, occupying two floors of a general hospital on   the outskirts of the city overlooking the River Rhine. The clinic used   modern equipment and claimed great success for its treatments although it   was always careful not to offer guarantees of cures to patients. The   treatment involved taking bone marrow from patients, harvesting stem cells   from the bone marrow and then reinjecting those stem cells into other parts   of the body. The clinic did not appear to offer up its claims to independent scrutiny while   experts suggested any improvement in condition reported by patients after   treatment could be caused by the placebo effect.A doctor at the clinic told a Sunday Telegraph undercover reporter, who   suffers from multiple sclerosis and is confined to a wheelchair, that he   might walk again should he agree to the stem cell treatments.The XCell-Center did not respond to inquiries from The Sunday Telegraph."

GM licorice could help stop desertification                                                                        GM plants found in Scotland                                                                        Prince Charles warns GM crops risk causing biggest-ever environment disaster                                                Cotton grown in China that has been genetically modified to produce the insecticide, Bt, had a wider impact on insect pests than the target crop, a discovery which is welcomed by the agriculture lobby and criticised by environmentalists.          Drs Kongming Wu and colleagues analysed data from 1997, when the GM cotton was commercialised, to 2007 about the agriculture of Bt cotton in northern China, and compared them to data on pest populations in the region.         The  use of Bt cotton reduced the populations of cotton bollworms, a problematic pest for Chinese farmers, cutting the need for pesticides by around half, and reduced the insects on neighbouring crops.          The insect usually moves between crops, after first invading cotton.          'Bt cotton kills most of the larvae of the second generation and accordingly works as a dead-end trap crop for cotton bollworm population,' said Dr Wu.          'This case study for Bt cotton also implies that other Bt crops such as Bt rice may have a great potential value for agricultural practices in China,' he added.           Bt is an insecticide derived from the spores and toxic crystals of the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis, and has been sold commercially since 1960. It is considered non-toxic to humans, animals, fish, plants, micro-organisms, and most insects.          However, it is lethal to caterpillars of moths and butterflies.  However, major challenge to the success of Bt cotton in China remains the potential for insects to evolve resistance to it.           Dr Wu and colleagues recommend that Bt cotton should be considered only one component in the overall management of pests. Environmentalists will argue that the study shows  GM crops could disrupt neighbouring ecosystems but Dr Wu said: 'There are two kinds of ecological balances, one is balance for all wild species, another is for agricultural production.         'Bt cotton is good for ecological balance in an agricultural system. If environmentalists want to get an ecological balance for all wild species,  this means we need to protect wild ecology and risk food shortages.'           Cotton bollworm is one of the most important insect pests of cotton, corn, soybean, peanut and vegetables. In 1992, this pest cut China's cotton yield by almost one third.  The outbreaks resulted in overuse of chemical insecticides which increased cost, polluted environmental, and bring a series of economic, ecological and social issues.           Dr. Jian-Zhou Zhao, a co-author, also highlights the health benefits of using Bt cotton.          'Poisoning from other insecticides, and even death, was a big problem for cotton farmers in the 1990s. Most farmers did not have proper protective clothes while applying insecticides with small backpack sprayers. This may be another reason that many farmers refused to plant cotton before Bt was available - it was too dangerous and scary.'           Commenting on the study, Friends of the Earth’s GM campaigner, Clare Oxborrow said:  'It's not surprising that the number of target pests has fallen - the GM cotton contains a toxin poisonous to them.           'This study tells us nothing about the wider ecological impacts of growing Bt cotton, such as the impact on non-target species. It also fails to identify the impact on crop yields and the overall level of pesticide-use.         'This limited study must not be used to justify the cultivation of GM cotton – or any other GM crop.'"
telegraph,12/10/2004 0:01,news,"He left behind 17 films, and around a dozen TV movies. But Christopher Reeve's true legacy may well turn out to be his tireless campaigning for medical science.          In private he contemplated ending his life shortly after his horse riding accident. But in public he never lost faith in the power of medical science to find a cure for his paralysis.          With Michael J Fox and Nancy Reagan, he was Hollywood's highest-profile advocate of stem cell research and repeatedly challenged the Bush administration's opposition to the technology.          Last week, John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate, drew on the Reeve legend in the second presidential debate during a critique of Bush's stem cell policy.          'Chris Reeve is a friend of mine,' he said. 'Chris Reeve exercises every single day to keep those muscles alive for the day when he believes he can walk again. And I want him to walk again.' Within a year of the horse riding accident in 1995, Reeve was campaigning for spinal cord injury research. The Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation raised millions of dollars.          Then, in 1998, scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore revealed that they had grown human embryonic stem cells for the first time.          Embryonic stem cells are found in newly conceived embryos. Not only can they turn into any type of body tissue, they can also be cultured indefinitely, potentially offering patients an unlimited supply of spare tissue for transplant.          Reeve's hope was that embryonic stem cells could be used to treat spinal injuries. Unlike most cells in the body, cells in the central nervous system do not repair themselves after injury.          He believed that doctors could create an embryo clone of a patient, and then use stem cells from the embryo to repair the spinal cord. Because the cells would have the same genetic make-up as the patient, there would be no danger of rejection. Last year researchers showed that embryonic stem cells could restore movement to rats that had suffered spinal injuries.          In 2001 President Bush ruled that federal funds should not be used for research that led to the destruction of human embryos. Reeve campaigned against Bush's stance, and repeatedly praised Britain, where embryo stem cell research is more freely permitted. British scientists paid tribute to the actor yesterday.          Dr Miodrag Stojkovic, of Newcastle University, the first scientist to get permission to clone human embryos for stem cell research in Britain, said: 'We are extremely saddened because the world lost not only an excellent actor, but also one of the leading figures who encouraged debate on the subject of human embryonic stem cell research. We will miss his contribution.'          Paul Smith, the executive director of the UK Spinal Injury Association, said Reeve was an 'incredible inspiration'."
telegraph,17/09/2013 00:01,news,"Healthy lifestyle changes such as eating whole foods and practising yoga could reverse the ageing of the body's cells, a new study suggests. Patients who adopted healthy diets, exercise regimes and 'stress   management' techniques such as meditation or yoga for five years   developed younger-looking chromosomes. The type of change seen in their chromosomes, the structures which house our   genetic code, has previously been linked to a lower risk of age-related   disease and greater life expectancy. The findings, from a pilot study of prostate cancer patients, could equally   apply to women and healthy men although larger studies are needed to confirm   the results, researchers said. They studied data on 35 patients who had a non-aggressive form of prostate   cancer and had chosen to be regularly assessed by doctors rather than   undergoing conventional treatment. Ten of the men adopted a 'lifestyle change intervention' which   included eating a plant-based diet of whole foods, moderate exercise, stress   management and regular group support classes, while the other 25 made no   change to their lifestyle. The scientists, from the University of California, San Francisco, examined   changes in the men's telomeres, structures which sit at the ends of   chromosomes like the protective caps on the end of a shoelace. Telomeres prevent the DNA within our chromosomes from being damaged, but as we   grow older they become shorter and cells begin to age and die more rapidly. Previous studies have linked the shortening of telomeres to a decrease in life   expectancy and a greater risk of age-related diseases such as heart disease,   vascular dementia, obesity, stroke, diabetes and various cancers. But the new research found that in the group who adopted strict and   comprehensive healthy changes to their diet and lifestyle, telomeres   lengthened by an average of 10 per cent over five years. The more positive changes the men made, the greater the increase in telomere   length. In contrast, among those who did not alter their way of life,   telomeres decreased in length by three per cent on average. Although it is well known that a healthy diet and plenty of exercise can   result in a host of medical befits, the findings published in The Lancet   Oncology journal, are the first evidence of such an effect on telomeres. Prof Dean Ornish, who led the study, said: 'The implications of this   relatively small pilot study may go beyond men with prostate cancer.  'If validated by large-scale randomised controlled trials, these   comprehensive lifestyle changes may significantly reduce the risk of a wide   variety of diseases and premature mortality. Our genes, and our telomeres,   are a predisposition, but they are not necessarily our fate.” Dr Lynne Cox, a Biochemistry lecturer at the University of Oxford, who was not   involved in the study, said the findings 'support the calls for   adoption of and adherence to healthier lifestyles'. It is 'perhaps too soon to judge whether this increase in telomere length   will correlate with increased longevity or healthspan', she added. Four lifestyle improvements which could lengthen telomeres Diet Participants adopted a diet high in whole foods such as fruit, vegetables,   pulses and grains. They cut down on refined carbohydrates, such as white   bread, and lowered their fat intake to less than 10 per cent of all the   calories in their diet. ExerciseThe men were asked to undertake 'moderate' levels of aerobic   exercise for the duration of the study, for example walking for half an hour   a day, six times per week. Stress managementExercises participants carried out to lower their stress levels were gentle   yoga-based stretching routines, breathing exercises, meditation and 'progressive   relaxation', a technique which involves tensing and relaxing different   muscle groups in turn. Social supportThe men were asked to attend one hour-long group 'social support'   session each week, led by a clinical psychologist. "

PGPR reduces the viscosity of chocolate and is used by companies as a replacement for expensive raw ingredient cocoa butter. The decision comes amid a growing backlash against 'Frankenfoods'. Critics of GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms) foods consider them environmentally suspect and a possible health threat.But many in the food industry insist the foods are safe, the technology boosts food production, and its use is less environmentally harmful than traditional farming methods.Hershey's joins other companies including General Mills, Unilever and Post Foods in responding to consumers' demand to remove GMO ingredients from products.And just last week, Nestle announced that it will cut artificial colors and flavors from its U.S. confectionery by the end of 2015.Hershey's acted after tens of thousands of people urged the company to drop GMO ingredients on their Facebook page and through emails in a relentless campaign led by GMO Inside.But in a statement, John Roulac, co-chair of GMO Inside, said that Hershey's has further to go.'Hershey's needs to take the next step and go non-GMO with all of its chocolates, and get third-party verification for non-GMO ingredients. This includes sourcing milk from cows not fed GMOs and agreeing to prohibit any synthetic biology ingredients, starting with vanilla,' he said. 'Consumers are increasingly looking for non-GMO products and verification, and Hershey's and its competitors would be wise to offer third-party verified non-GMO products to consumers.' The move comes after Hershey's said last December that it was exploring transitioning away from high fructose corn syrup.It announced its decision last week.'We all want and deserve to know what's in our food,' said the company's president and CEO John P. Bilbrey in a statement.'We will strive for simplicity with all of our ingredients, but we may not achieve it with every product. This is a journey and it will take time.'We are equally committed to sharing what we achieve and what we don't. For ingredients that may not be as simple, we will explain what they are and why we need them to provide the great flavors, aromas, textures and appearances that our consumers know and love.'The company said the new ingredients would be more expensive but promised to maintain consumer prices, the Confectionery News reported. GMOs are plants and animals that have had been created by mixing DNA from different species to make a new one. They are found in many strains of corn, sugar beets and soy, among other foods.There has been debate over the health impacts of the technology, and there has been a push throughout Europe to drop what critics have dubbed 'Frankenfoods'. Last May, Vermont ruled that GM food must carry a label - the first state to make labeling a legal requirement. The legislation will come into force in 2016.Maine and Connecticut have previously passed laws requiring labels on GMO foods, but their laws don't take effect unless neighboring states follow suit.Last year, the Biotechnology Industry Organization said in a statement that scientists and regulators worldwide recognize that foods made from genetically modified crops are safe.'And these same GM crops have enabled farmers to produce more on less land with fewer pesticide applications, less water and reduced on-farm fuel use,' BIO Vice President Cathleen Enright said.   "
dailymail,13/03/2015 12:39,sciencetech,"High social status has its privileges - even in wild animals.Researchers studying spotted hyenas in Kenya found that high-ranking members of a clan live longer, are healthier and even have more offspring.The discovery was made by analysing the lengths of telomeres - caps at the end of each strand of DNA - regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species, including humans. Nora Lewin from Michigan State Univerity's zoology department  said: 'If you want to see the hierarchy of spotted hyenas, throw down some fresh meat near them. 'It's quickly apparent who's dominant and who's not.'But she wanted to know if these long-accepted biological markers would support what she was seeing in the field.Ms Lewin worked with fellow lead author and MSU zoologist Kay Holekamp to study more than 25 years of data on hyenas across the African country. She also spent a summer in Kenya observing hyenas' social structure.The team of researchers focused on telomeres, caps that protect chromosomes from deterioration.These biomarkers are regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species, including humans.  Shrinking telomeres are a signal that cells are sliding into 'defensive mode', stressful actions that could lead to cells' - and to the person or animal's - death.High-ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers suggesting they were healthier.Group membership significantly predicted telomere length of those female hyenas that sat at the top of the social hierarchy.But Ms Lewin also noted a couple of interesting twists. The alpha females of each clan had the longest telomeres. However, the length was relative to each individual clan. This meant that if researchers found a lone hyena wandering the savanna they couldn't simply identify it as an alpha female based solely on telomere length.Also the team was able to rule other factors that could possibly influence telomere length such as abundance of food - which could be linked to better overall health.Its research found no correlation between the amount of food and the size of the biological marker. 'This work shows, for the first time, the effects of social rank on telomere length in wild mammals,' Ms Lewin said.'This enhances our understanding of how social and ecological variables may contribute to age-related declines of hyenas, and in organisms in general.''The fact that there is variation in telomere length when prey abundance is constant means that there are other factors we need to find.'We think it's less about genetics and more influenced by the environment, but we just need to keep searching for the right environmental factors.'The results are published in the journal of Biology Letters."

The team had intended to use human eggs to clone embryos in its efforts to create human stem cells for research on motor neurone disease, which kills 1,000 people a year in Britain.          But the scientists, including Prof Ian Wilmut, who led the effort to clone Dolly the sheep, have been forced to think about alternatives as a result of the furore triggered by the falsification of stem cell data in South Korea.          Dr Hwang Woo-suk's team appear to have coerced women into donating eggs.          As a result of the scandal, fewer women will now be willing to donate eggs for cloning research in Britain, Prof Chris Shaw of the Institute of Psychiatry, London, predicted.          He said it could have a similar impact to the Alder Hey organs scandal, when tissue donation 'fell off a cliff' as a result of the unauthorised removal, retention and disposal of human tissue.          As well as human eggs, the team now wants to use rabbit eggs. This has been done before by Dr Hui Zhen Sheng's team at the Shanghai Second Medical University.          She used the Dolly technique to fuse human cells with rabbit eggs to produce early-stage embryos, which in turn yielded human stem cells. Prof Wilmut has already visited her team to discuss the method.          While scientists call an embryo that is a blend of cells from different individuals a chimera, in reference to a monster from Greek mythology, these embryos have only one type of nuclear DNA and are called hybrids or 'cybrids'.          Although cybrid stem cells could not be used for treatments, they will prove invaluable for studies of the process that makes nerves die in motor neurone disease and how to prevent this with drugs, said Prof Shaw.          Discussions are under way with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Prof Shaw stressed that the chimeras would not be allowed to develop beyond an early stage. He and Prof Wilmut had intended to collaborate with Prof Hwang but yesterday Prof Shaw said: 'It was over before it had even started.'          The use of cybrids and chimeras is 'a grey area' in terms of current regulations, which are under review, said Prof Alison Murdoch, of the International Centre for Life, Newcastle upon Tyne, one of the team that cloned the first human embryo in the West.          She added that there were already difficulties obtaining eggs, for instance from women undergoing IVF treatment. 'We are looking now to find other sources,' she said, adding that egg collection was expensive, costing about £3,000 for each woman.          The rabbit-human cybrid work looked convincing, said Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, of the National Institute of Medical Research, Mill Hill.          Dr Sheng's team used donor cells from the foreskins of a five-year-old boy and two men, and facial tissue from a woman. They fused the nuclei (containing DNA) of the human cells with rabbit eggs from which they had removed the nuclei. The resulting embryos were dismantled and used to derive six lines of stem cells … flexible cells that can develop into any type.          They would not be used for treatments because of concerns about disease. Also, the few rabbit genes present might generate proteins that would be attacked by the human immune system.          Dr Chris O'Toole, the head of research regulation at the HFEA, said: 'The issue of mixing human and animal material is complex and not thoroughly and explicitly dealt with under the current legislation.          'However, any research that involves putting a human cell's nucleus into an animal egg would require a licence from the HFEA.          'As with all research involving human embryos, the research team would have to show that the research is both necessary and desirable, and that any embryo created could not be allowed to develop for longer than 14 days or be implanted in a woman.'                      rhighfield@telegraph.co.uk                               Publishers wishing to reproduce photographs on this page should phone 44 (0) 207 538 7505 or e-mail syndication@telegraph.co.uk                     "

As well as human eggs, the team now wants to use rabbit eggs. This has been done before by Dr Hui Zhen Sheng's team at the Shanghai Second Medical University.          She used the Dolly technique to fuse human cells with rabbit eggs to produce early-stage embryos, which in turn yielded human stem cells. Prof Wilmut has already visited her team to discuss the method.          While scientists call an embryo that is a blend of cells from different individuals a chimera, in reference to a monster from Greek mythology, these embryos have only one type of nuclear DNA and are called hybrids or 'cybrids'.          Although cybrid stem cells could not be used for treatments, they will prove invaluable for studies of the process that makes nerves die in motor neurone disease and how to prevent this with drugs, said Prof Shaw.          Discussions are under way with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Prof Shaw stressed that the chimeras would not be allowed to develop beyond an early stage. He and Prof Wilmut had intended to collaborate with Prof Hwang but yesterday Prof Shaw said: 'It was over before it had even started.'          The use of cybrids and chimeras is 'a grey area' in terms of current regulations, which are under review, said Prof Alison Murdoch, of the International Centre for Life, Newcastle upon Tyne, one of the team that cloned the first human embryo in the West.          She added that there were already difficulties obtaining eggs, for instance from women undergoing IVF treatment. 'We are looking now to find other sources,' she said, adding that egg collection was expensive, costing about £3,000 for each woman.          The rabbit-human cybrid work looked convincing, said Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, of the National Institute of Medical Research, Mill Hill.          Dr Sheng's team used donor cells from the foreskins of a five-year-old boy and two men, and facial tissue from a woman. They fused the nuclei (containing DNA) of the human cells with rabbit eggs from which they had removed the nuclei. The resulting embryos were dismantled and used to derive six lines of stem cells … flexible cells that can develop into any type.          They would not be used for treatments because of concerns about disease. Also, the few rabbit genes present might generate proteins that would be attacked by the human immune system.          Dr Chris O'Toole, the head of research regulation at the HFEA, said: 'The issue of mixing human and animal material is complex and not thoroughly and explicitly dealt with under the current legislation.          'However, any research that involves putting a human cell's nucleus into an animal egg would require a licence from the HFEA.          'As with all research involving human embryos, the research team would have to show that the research is both necessary and desirable, and that any embryo created could not be allowed to develop for longer than 14 days or be implanted in a woman.'                      rhighfield@telegraph.co.uk                               Publishers wishing to reproduce photographs on this page should phone 44 (0) 207 538 7505 or e-mail syndication@telegraph.co.uk                     "
telegraph,5/9/2010 9:15,news,"Patients have threatened to sue a doctor after paying £10,000 for a stem cell treatment that did not work. Karen Galley's dream was for her son to see her walk. Suffering from multiple sclerosis and confined to a wheelchair, Miss Galley   was prepared to try anything – and pay anything – to find a cure. So when she learnt of a doctor who had boasted of an 80% success rate in   treating MS patients by injecting them with stem cells, Miss Galley grabbed   at the chance. Friends and colleagues at the City moneybroker's where she worked helped her   raise the £10,500 needed for the treatment. One ran a mini-marathon; another undertook a sponsored diet. By August 2006,   Miss Galley and her friend Tracy Wagstaff, another MS sufferer, were on a   plane to Rotterdam to be injected with stem cells by Dr Robert Trossel. Six months earlier, on Dr Trossel's advice that it would improve the   effectiveness of the treatment, she had all her mercury fillings removed at   a further cost of £2,500. At his clinic, based on a housing estate on the outskirts of the Dutch city,   Miss Galley was injected once in the arm and six times in the neck. After   two hours' supervision, she was told to go back to her hotel and then to her   home in Essex. 'I was desperate. I just wanted my son Sam to see me walk,' recalled   Miss Galley, 'But it never made any difference except I later developed   a blood disorder.'Tomorrow Dr Trossel will appear before the General Medical Council where he   faces being struck off. He has already been found guilty of exploiting   vulnerable patients and abusing his position as a doctor. He charged multiple sclerosis sufferers as much as £12,500 per injection using   stem cells not designed for human use, including serum taken from the brain   and spinal cord of cows. Patients contacted by The Sunday Telegraph are considering launching a   class action against the disgraced doctor once the hearing into whether he   is fit to practise concludes at the end of the month. 'I want him done. I hate the man. He conned us all,' said Miss   Galley, 'He told me it worked for 80 per cent of the people and he said   I would walk again.'Other MS patients tell a similar story. Catherine Neal, a 46-year-old   mother-of-two, from Enfield in north London, who used her father's life   savings to pay the clinic £13,500, said: 'I have no idea what I   was injected with. 'I was told later it was bovine stem cells. I had an injection in my arm,   another in my neck which really hurt and a third in the stomach. It made no   difference at all. I just felt really tired afterwards. 'I would love to sue him; I would love to get the money back. I was   totally taken in by him; he preyed on our desperation. When you are in a   situation like mine you will try anything.'She – along with other patients – is now concerned she may at some stage   contract mad cow disease. The case highlights the growing number of clinics around the world offering   stem-cell treatments. Such treatments are currently illegal in the UK, prompting British patients –   desperate for 'miracle' cures – to go abroad despite the lack of medical   evidence of whether stem cell therapies actually work or are even safe. Dr Trossel, 56, appears to have made a fortune from his treatments. According to eyewitnesses, he was injecting – perfectly legally under the then   Dutch laws – as many as six patients a day at his Preventief Medisch Centrum   clinic in the Netherlands. At roughly £10,000 a patient, that could produce an income of as much as   £60,000 a day at its peak. He also ran a private clinic in Wimpole Street in   central London. Dr Jayne Spink, Director of Policy & Research at the MS Society, said: 'Regulatory   gaps allow practices like Dr Trossel's to go unchallenged and exploit   vulnerable people. 'We've consistently warned of the dangers of unproven stem cell treatments –   there is no way of knowing the health risks involved, the credentials of the   practitioner or whether materials being used in patients are actually what   the clinics claim them to be.'Martyn Day, senior partner at the leading medical negligence law firm Leigh   Day & Co, said: 'All of the people injected in this way will on the   face of it have a strong case against Dr Trossel – both in relation to the   cost of the treatment and any harm suffered as well. It is an outrage.'At the conclusion of a lengthy hearing in April, the GMC found that Dr   Trossel's treatment 'was unjustifiable, not in the best interests of   the patients and was exploitative of a vulnerable patient'. The GMC concluded he had abused his position as a doctor and it must now   decide if he should be struck off. He is currently suspended from practising   in the UK. At his home in Stoke Poges which he shares with his wife Wendy Denning, a   television doctor and advocate of complementary medicine, Dr Trossel said he   was unable to comment. He said: 'I've been advised by my legal representatives not to comment at   this stage. I will of course be attending the hearing on Monday in person.'In an interview in a magazine for MS sufferers in 2006, Dr Trossel said 'Occasionally   some patients have experienced results very quickly – the same or the next   day. On average, treatment benefits usually peak between 3 and 6 months   after treatment.'He said he had treated approximately 60 MS patients over an 18 month period   and of those, he said 10 per cent were now walking and out of a wheelchair   while another 80% 'have had a proven significant clinical benefit from   the treatment'. The GMC however concluded there was no scientific basis for his claims while   Dr trossel admitted he had no research background in stem cell therapy. The article was widely read by MS patients who then made appointments at his   Rotterdam clinic. Dr Trossel's lawyer Simon Eastwood said he too could not comment but added: 'He   has denied exploiting patients.'At one stage Dr Trossel administered stem cell treatment on behalf of a South   African firm, ACT, whose founders, Stephen Van Rooyen and Laura Brown, are   still wanted by the FBI for allegedly running a fraudulent stem cell   business in the United States. He severed ties with ACT in 2006. "
telegraph,14/11/2004 00:08,news,"Patients whose livers are destroyed by alcohol or infection could grow a new organ using their own stem cells after a breakthrough by British scientists.          At present the demand for new livers outweighs the number provided by donors by 10 to one, a figure that transplant specialists expect to increase. The former footballer and alcoholic George Best caused controversy in 2002 when he received a liver transplant and then continued drinking.          Now researchers at London's Hammersmith Hospital and Imperial College are about to begin trials that could enable patients to rebuild livers inside their own bodies within five years.          The first human tests of the method, which involves injecting stem cells to regenerate diseased livers, will begin before Christmas.          Nagy Habib, a professor of heptobiliary surgery at Imperial College, who is leading the research, said: 'This could be the big breakthrough we have been looking for. We desperately need something in addition to transplantation.          'With kidney failure you can keep a patient on dialysis for years, but that is not possible with liver disease patients. Eventually their liver failure will worsen and they will need a transplant.'          Prof Habib will treat 15 patients initially to prove that personal stem cell treatment is safe.          It involves taking blood from a patient suffering from liver failure and separating it into its component parts.          The stem cells are separated from the white blood cells, before the red blood cells are returned to the body.          The stem cells are exposed to liver growth factors, which it is believed will precipitate their metamorphosis into liver cells. They are then injected into the liver.          Prof Habib believes that the stem cells will then multiply and colonise the liver to such an extent that the organ will began functioning properly again. Effectively, he said, the patient would be growing a new liver.          Prof Habib said that he was optimistic about stem cell therapy. 'The beauty about personal stem cells is they are easily obtainable and there aren't the issues of immune rejection which you can get with donor cells.'          Patients with liver failure caused by alcohol abuse could be key beneficiaries. According to UK Transplant, 258 of the 686 people who received liver transplants in 2003/4 had cirrhosis, a disease associated with heavy drinking. Of the 244 people awaiting transplants, 148 had cirrhosis as their primary liver disease.          Victims of viral hepatitis or other liver diseases could also benefit if the treatment proves effective.          Tracy Scrivin, 40, a mother of two from Dyrham in Wiltshire, was six weeks away from death when she had a liver transplant after a serious liver infection in 2002. She welcomed the prospect of stem cell treatments for liver failure.          'I'd be in favour of any technique that could minimise the physical pain and the mental trauma of the patient,' she said.          'After the operation, I had a tube running out of my liver and into a bag for three months. It wasn't so much the physical recovery, although that was tough. I am always very aware of having someone else's liver inside me. Psychologically, that's hard.'          Prof Habib said that he hoped that future patients might be spared a similar ordeal.          'We are several years away yet before we can bring on this treatment, but I think its chances of working are good,' he said. 'If all goes well we could see stem cells being used to reverse liver failure in about five years.'          George Best, the former Manchester United footballer, has suffered a series of health problems after years of heavy drinking.          Best, 58, collapsed four years ago with cirrhosis of the liver, and in 2002, he underwent 10 hours of surgery to have a liver transplant.          He is currently living at the Forst Mere health spa in Liphook, Hampshire. He has admitted to drinking since the transplant, even though his doctors told him that any more alcohol might kill him."
telegraph,1/5/2015 0:00,news,"People who develop cancer have shorter telomeres, the caps at the end of chromosomes which protect the DNA  Genetic changes can predict cancer up to 13 years in the future, according to new research.  Harvard and Northwestern University discovered that tiny but significant changes are already happening in the body more than a decade before cancer is diagnosed.  They found that the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes, which prevent DNA damage, had significantly more wear and tear in people who went on to develop cancer. In fact, in some cases they looked 15 years older.  Those caps, known as telomeres, were much shorter than they should be and continued to get shorter until around four years before the cancer developed, when they suddenly stopped shrinking. All the people with the changes went on to develop cancer.  'Understanding this pattern of telomere growth may mean it can be a predictive biomarker for cancer,' said Dr. Lifang Hou, the lead study author and a professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.  'Because we saw a strong relationship in the pattern across a wide variety of cancers, with the right testing these procedures could be used to eventually diagnose a wide variety of cancers.'  Although many people may not want to know that they will develop cancer in the future, it could allow them to make lifestyle changes to lower their risk. Stanford University is also working on a project looking at how telemores can be regrown.  However insurance companies warned that such a test could push up policy premiums.  Matt Sanders, in charge of protection insurance products at GoCompare, said people with such a diagnoses could be priced out of the insurance marker.  “If this test showed 100 per cent probability over a certain number of years then it could affect premiums. It would be the equivalent of living in a high theft area for someone looking for home insurance,” he said.  “Premiums could rise to a point where some people would simply be priced out. However if it was shown that diagnosing earlier could prevent cancer then that could bring down premiums.”  Aviva also said that continually monitored advances in medical sciences ‘ to ensure they are reflected in the premiums paid by our customers, where appropriate.’   Telomeres sit at the end of chromosomes, and protect the tightly bound strands of DNA  In the new study, scientists took multiple measurements of telomeres over a 13-year period in 792 persons, 135 of whom were eventually diagnosed with different types of cancer, including prostate, skin, lung and leukaemia.  Initially, scientists discovered telomeres aged much faster, indicated by a more rapid loss of length, in individuals who were developing but not yet diagnosed with cancer.  Telomeres in all the people who went on to develop cancer looked as much as 15 years older than those of people who were not developing the disease.  But then scientists found the accelerated aging process stopped three to four years before the cancer diagnosis.  Telomeres shorten every time a cell divides. The older a person is, the more times each cell has divided, and the shorter their telomeres.  Because cancer cells divide and grow rapidly, scientists would expect the cell would get so short it would self-destruct. But that's not what happens, scientists discovered.  “We found cancer has hijacked the telomere shortening in order to flourish in the body,” added Dr Hou.  The team is hoping that if it can identify how cancer hijacks the cell, then treatments could be developed to cause cancer cells to self-destruct without harming healthy cells.  The research was published in the online journal Ebiomedicine. "
telegraph,12/7/2001 0:00,news,"PRESIDENT BUSH is facing unexpected pressure from within his Republican Party to back away from one of his key campaign pledges: to block the spending of taxpayers' money on controversial research into human embryo cells.Mr Bush is being urged to make up his mind on the issue - which is dividing his administration - before he goes to Rome later this month to meet the Pope, who opposes such research and sees it as morally equivalent to abortion.Failure by Mr Bush to decide beforehand, some advisers believe, will expose him to accusations of allowing the Pope undue influence if he subsequently blocks the research, and of discourtesy if he changes his mind.Vice-President Dick Cheney is thought by some to be among those senior Republicans favouring a rethink over 'stem cell' research aimed at finding cures for diseases.Mr Bush's promise to oppose federal funding of such research was one of a series of moves during last year's United States presidential campaign designed to win over Roman Catholic voters, millions of whom were swayed by his 'pro-life' hostility to abortion. Some people look towards his final decision - which he has promised to take 'in a while' - as a defining moment of his presidency.Opponents of the research, which is permitted in Britain, Canada and some other countries, argue that it amounts to taking human life since the embryo from which the cells are taken is destroyed in the process.Supporters of the research argue that it could lead to cures for a range of major illnesses, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart diseases and cancers.'People who are pro-life are also pro-life for existing life,' said Orrin Hatch, a Republican senator for Utah, a devout Mormon and an opponent of abortion, who surprised colleagues by publicly backing stem cell research last month.

They can then be grown into 'lines' of similar cells for experimentation.Some of the hopes for the medical use of stem cells were dashed last week, however, in a report published in the US journal Science. It said that cloned mice created with embryonic stem cells were often found to have hidden genetic instabilities - a finding that could lend support to opponents of stem cell research.'This study confirms the suspicions of many of us that cloning of humans would be really dangerous,' said Rudolf Jaenisch, head of the study and a researcher at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Massachusetts.Another author of the study, David Humpherys, pointed out that, while many of the mice cloned in their experiments appeared to be normal, evidence emerged that their genes did not work properly during embryonic and foetal development.'It is quite likely that just the animals that are most-nearly normal make it to birth [in cloning], but our study shows that that doesn't mean they are completely normal,' said Mr Humpherys. 'There may be changes in gene expression that could affect them later in life.'Senator Hatch is one of a small but growing number of elected Republican politicians who are urging Mr Bush to soften the stance he took during the election campaign.

telegraph,11/9/2012 7:30,news,"Research into the bulk of DNA has found that it is anything but surplus to requirements The lexicon of science is riddled with catchy yet misleading terms. The “god   particle” is nothing of the sort. Genes cannot really be “selfish”, and when   astronomers talk about “metals”, they usually mean something else entirely.   Now, we must add “junk DNA” to the list of scientific misnomers.Last week, the results of the multinational Encode Project were published   across 30 papers in the journals Nature, Science, Genome Biology and Genome   Research. The five-year collaboration involved some 450 scientists working   in 32 institutions and took up 300 years of computer time. The goal was to   analyse the vast bulk of human DNA that does not constitute a gene – ie,   does not directly code for the creation of particular proteins – and is   seemingly surplus to requirements.The conclusion? That this DNA is not junk at all, but absolutely vital for the   functioning of our cells. It turns out that as much as a fifth of the 98 per   cent of our DNA that falls into this category is instead made up, among   other things, of “switches” – bits of DNA that turn some genes on and others   off. It is now believed that, in order to get to grips with genetic   illnesses such as hereditary heart disease, some forms of diabetes and   Crohn’s Disease, we need to understand these regulatory elements as much as   the genes themselves.It has been clear for a long time that there is a lot more to DNA than just   genes. Indeed, one of the great scientific surprises in recent decades has   been the discovery that the human genome is surprisingly bereft of actual   genes. When the first draft of it was published in the summer of 2001, it   did not describe the 100,000 or more genes that most biologists assumed we   had, but fewer than 20,000 – making Homo sapiens not much more well-endowed   genetically than a fruit fly or even a lump of yeast. As an editorial in   Nature put it, “Unless the human genome contains a lot of genes that are   opaque to our computers, it is clear we do not gain our undoubted complexity   over worms and plants by using many more genes”.Partly as a result, the idea that scanning a person’s genome can tell us   pretty much everything about them – their likely intelligence, the chance of   criminal tendencies, their probable age and cause of death – is now seen as   a simplistic fantasy. Indeed, the more we learn about our genome, the more   complex the story becomes. We have genes that tell our bodies to make   proteins, genes that affect other genes, genes that are influenced by the   environment, segments of DNA that switch certain genes on and off, as well   as our RNA, the still-not-fully understood messenger molecule that conveys   information from our DNA to protein factories in the cells.Despite the fanfare with which the Encode findings were greeted last week,   biologists have known for years that junk DNA, a term coined in 1972 by the   Japanese-American geneticist Susumu Ohno, performs a host of functions,   among them gene regulation. Indeed, it was always obvious that much of our   DNA must be tasked with the activation or suppression of other parts of   itself: genes that make bone tissue are present in all cells but are only   switched on in bone cells; heart muscle genes are present but inactive in   your teeth and liver and everywhere else.Furthermore, as Ohno pointed out, a great deal of the genome consists of   “pseudogenes” – non-functioning copies of active genes that form the raw   material of evolution. Without this spare genetic material, natural   selection would have nothing to act upon. We have also known for some time   that the “dark” part of our genome contains what are known as human   endogenous retroviruses: bits of the genetic code from viruses that are a   legacy of our long battle with these microbes. In millennia to come, it is   likely that bits of the genome for HIV will become similarly incorporated   into our DNA, as a legacy of the Aids epidemic.The more we learn, the more the recipe book of life turns out to resemble less   a single tome than a well-organised library, complete with a sophisticated   index and with the ability to lend and borrow books. Some of the volumes are   crucial – a mix-up in the code could kill or cripple us – while others   moulder in the stacks. There is probably a lot of built-in redundancy, which   is not surprising considering that the genomes of any species are the result   of three billion years of evolution. Perhaps the most amazing thing is that   we can make any sense of it at all.  "
telegraph,20/06/2005 00:01,news,"Scientists have created the precursors of human sperm and eggs from 'building block' stem cells, raising the prospect that infertile and homosexual couples could have babies that are genetically their own.          A British team has, for the first time, used embryonic stem cells to grow primordial germ cells (PGC) which later develop into either sperm or eggs. In addition to being potentially of use in assisted reproduction such as IVF, synthetic sex cells could be used in therapeutic cloning and medical research.          Some researchers believe that the breakthrough means an egg could, in theory, be generated from a man's own stem cells and even that a child could be created from sperm and an engineered egg from the same man.          Behrouz Aflatoonian, a PhD student in Prof Harry Moore's laboratory at the Centre for Stem Cell Biology, University of Sheffield, will announce the breakthrough to delegates at the annual conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Copenhagen today.          He said yesterday: 'This suggests that human embryonic stem cells may have the ability to develop into primordial germ cells and early gametes [sperm or eggs] as has been shown previously for mouse embryonic stem cells.'          Prof Moore said: 'Ultimately it might be possible to produce sperm and eggs for use in assisted conception treatments. This is a long way off and we would have to prove it was safe.           'It would not be reproductive cloning, as fertilisation would involve only one set of gametes produced in this way and therefore a unique embryo would form.'          Scientists have previously achieved similar results in mice. Two years ago a team led by Prof Hans Scholer, of the University of Pennsylvania, reported the production of egg-like cells from mouse embryonic stem cells.          Mr Aflatoonian derived embryonic stem cell lines from embryos donated for research by couples undergoing IVF treatment.          The human embryonic stem cells were allowed to develop into collections of cells called embryoid bodies. Within two weeks a tiny proportion of cells in the embryoid bodies began to express some of the genes found in human primordial germ cells.          Some cells also expressed proteins found only in maturing sperm.          Producing functional mature sperm and eggs in the laboratory will be much more difficult because of the need to replicate the environment of the developing follicle for egg development or the tissue of the testis for sperm.          However, the breakthrough could potentially help to solve the acute shortage of eggs and sperm donated for use by couples with fertility problems.          Eggs produced in the laboratory could also be used for therapeutic cloning - the transferring of genetic material from an adult cell to an emptied egg that is then stimulated to become an embryo.          Prof Moore added: 'One of the reasons for doing this research is that it may allow us to investigate the very earliest processes of how a human gamete and gonad [ovary and testis] develops.''          Prof Moore added that it was not yet clear whether the work meant a man's cells could be used to grow an egg.          However, Anna Smajdor, researcher in medical ethics at Imperial College London, said: 'Because the technique can be used to generate eggs from a man's somatic cells, gay couples could have children genetically related to both. Single men could even produce a child using their own sperm and an engineered egg.          'Women's fertility would no longer need to be curtailed at the menopause. These possibilities raise new questions about how we define parenthood.'                      nfleming@telegraph.co.uk         "
telegraph,24/08/2007 01:01,finance,"Sir Christopher Evans, the biotech entrepreneur recently cleared in the cash-for-honours scandal, has made the beach at Cannes his temporary office, and is renting a villa near by.                                                       Comment: No magic wand to speed up Merlin fraud probe                                                                        Sir Christopher Evans                                                                         Sir Christopher attacks two-year SFO probe                                             This afternoon, he is joining Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish billionaire who took a stake in Merlin last year, on his yacht and they will chat about deals with some other businessmen who have decamped for the summer to the French Riviera.         Of the Crown Prosecution Service's decision not to bring a case against Sir Chris, who loaned £1m to the Labour Party, he says: 'I was completely exonerated, which I knew all along because - for Christ's sake - I didn't have a peerage and no-one offered me one'.         Now the ebullient businessman is keen to clear his name in the other major scandal which has dogged him since 2005: a Serious Fraud Office investigation into allegations that Sir Chris has committed fraud in his running of Merlin Biosciences, the biotechnology venture capital firm he founded and retains a controlling stake in.         'The UK biotechnology sector does not need this SFO thing. Wherever I go people say, we need you back on the pitch full time, dropping goals. I want to get back on the pitch full time, and I am doing so,' says Sir Chris.         After two years of near silence, one of the UK's most outspoken businessmen is back, hinting at big deals in Merlin's pipeline as well as a plan to put together a large fund of cash from Middle Eastern investors to focus on healthcare.         In addition to the business ventures, Sir Chris has put bringing down the SFO investigation firmly on his agenda.         The SFO opened an investigation into Sir Chris in 2005 on the basis of allegations made by Andrew Greene, a former senior Merrill Lynch investment banker who joined Merlin as managing director. Mr Greene, who parted acrimoniously with Merlin in January 2004, alleged there was evidence of fraud relating to the third investment fund Merlin raised in 2003.         Sir Chris says of the ensuing probe: 'It is a stigma, it is destructive and it is a distraction. I will fight these guys to the very end and I will win.         'The sad irony is I've not lost a single penny for my investors in fund three. I'm making them real value. If there is a loss in value, it will be parked firmly at the door of the SFO, the very people who are supposed to protect investors', he says.         Merlin's lawyers wrote to the new attorney general, Baroness Scotland, in July to complain about the SFO's probe. Among the complaints are thought to be how long the investigation is taking, and a claim that offers from several of Merlin's investors and business partners to tell the SFO they are happy with the way the firm is being run have been ignored by the investigators.         'I even got a phone call from my life insurance people. The SFO had gone there, interviewing people, annoying people. What's that all about? I'm going to leave my clothes on the beach? I am going to do a Reggie Perrin?' Sir Chris says.         Instead of copying the tactics of Reginald Perrin, the 1970s sitcom character who faked his own death on Brighton beach, Sir Chris intends to 'take them head on'.         His difficulty is that the SFO's initial inquiry has grown into being one of its broadest probes of an individual, taking in several Merlin investments, as well as other financial entities such as Guernsey-based privately-owned companies.          Sir Christopher denies he owns any trusts in Guernsey, but says: 'There are loads of different things that are connected to me or to Merlin in different ways... I have offshore, onshore, loans, loan notes, tax advisers. It can become quite a complex world.'          He adds: 'All my stuff is very legit. It is very organised. I'm not sure the SFO understands it or knows what it is talking about.'         The problem with the SFO going on 'fishing trips' is, he says: 'What has happened in a number of instances is when you get through it all - there is nothing there. We say, how about an apology or some money back? No, that doesn't happen.'         Sir Chris accepts at the heart of the SFO's investigation are questions about how he does business. Sources who have spoken to the SFO have alleged the ties between the pugnacious businessman and Merlin are inappropriate and that he has made more money out of the firm than he should have done.         They have also said due to the way Merlin has been set up, it is very difficult to see clearly the ultimate beneficiaries of certain deals.          Sir Chris denies all wrong-doing, but acknowledges some people don't like his style.         'The accusations are that I am a maverick and about wheeling and dealing... I don't claim to be Mr Bank Manager or Mr Straight Line. I have a lot of complicated and complex things going on. But my overriding rule has always been that you look after investors.' Indeed, Sir Chris says, his investors want him to be involved in many aspects of Merlin.         Perhaps Sir Chris is in a mess with the SFO because, in his 20 year-plus career as a venture capitalist and one of the founding fathers of the biotechnology sector in the UK, he has made a lot of enemies?         'I'm a fighter, I will fight to make my investors money. I'm not afraid to make enemies and I've done that. Other venture capitalists have said: 'You do that deal and we aren't going to like you any more.' Well, you know what, don't. I'm not here to make friends,' he says.         For Merlin's third fund, which is worth about £100m and is invested in 10 companies, Sir Chris negotiated so that Merlin captured between 40pc and 95pc of the small companies it invested in, while paying only up to about £5m for the stakes. 'That is my job, to negotiate for as much equity as possible. Some people don't like that,' he says.         Both his admirers and detractors admit, Sir Chris is a consummate salesman, quick to point to high-profile successes, such as Chiroscience, which he grew from being a biotech tiddler into one of the largest UK players in the sector in the 1990s. He also highlights Plethora Solutions, a company focusing on urology and sexual dysfunction, which was floated in 2005. 'That went from nothing to about £50m in about a year,' he says.         Sir Chris's big hope is for ReNeuron, a stem cell company and a long-time Merlin investment. 'It is in my opinion a world leader in stem cell science. If they get their IND (investigational new drug application) we could see human trials in the spring and summer of next year, which would be the first instance of human stem cells being injected into a human brain'.         Sir Chris points out he was an early believer in stem cell science, and a big influence in getting Government backing so that the UK is at the cutting edge of research in the area. His work promoting stem cells was one of the things which brought him into close contact with Tony Blair.         Sir Chris says: 'In some ways my entire future is nailed to ReNeuron. I backed stem cells many years before other scientists and investors in Europe and America. If the IND doesn't happen and it is a flop, it will be moi that everyone is going to look at. But if it does, the shares are going to go wham, and more importantly people with severe strokes are going to be able to get up.'         ReNeuron was invested in by Merlin's first and second funds and Merlin retains a stake in the company, which is now listed on the stock market. If things go well for its stem cell science, it could be a huge boost for the two Merlin funds' performance, which both took a massive hit in the early 2000s when the biotech sector imploded.         Sir Chris says he is hopeful both funds will return investors' capital and some profit, which - he points out - would make them among the best venture capital performers operating during the difficult market conditions of 2001, 2002 and 2003.         He believes the third fund, which has been deployed during much better conditions since 2003, is on track to notch up very hefty profits for investors, which will also mean a bit payout for Sir Chris.         The Welshman, the son of a steelworker who grew up in Port Talbot, hits out at the accusations that dog him that his fortune - estimated by the Sunday Times Rich List at £158m - is 'smoke and mirrors'.         Sir Chris's love of hunting is well known, and he admits to owning a collection of 'antique weaponry - loads of swords, the odd suit of armour'.         There are also several Ferraris and 'the odd souped up thing'.         But he maintains he is not a 'glitzy guy'. He says: 'I don't run around with masses of jewellery. I don't have a yacht.'         Luckily, he has friends who do."
telegraph,18/09/2008 19:00,news,"Special nerve cells could be the key to more efficient repair of spinal cord injuries, according to a team that reports dramatic results in tests.                                                      Paralysis could be treated by nerve rewiring                                                                         Stem cell pioneer offers hope to the paralysed                                                                        Stem cell technology may make blood donations thing of the past                                             Scientists have found a way to make a kind of cells called astrocytes from embryonic stem cells.         Tests showed that they can coax 40 per cent of severed nerve fibres to regrow in around a week in rats with spinal injuries, restoring the animals' ability to move freely.            The team at the University of Colorado Denver is developing the human form of the cells that can be used for spinal cord injury clinical trials in humans.            The research teams considered the discovery that one astrocyte type, called GDAsBMP promoted repair, while others can actually cause damage, a 'breakthrough' that might change the way stem cells are used to repair spinal cord injuries.         'So far our progress has been far better than expected and we hope to translate this promising new cell replacement therapy to clinical trials within the next 2 to 3 years if all goes well,' said Briton Dr Stephen Davies, who reports the work in the Journal of Biology.         Astrocytes, which are star shaped with octopus like tentacles, account for 70 per cent of all cells in the central nervous system and play numerous roles in maintaining the structure, metabolism and function of the brain, and spinal cord.         Dr Davies, in collaboration with Drs Margot-Mayer-Proschel and Christoph Proschel at the University of Rochester, New York, transplanted two types of astrocytes.         Both types of astrocyte are made from the same embryo-derived stem cell-like precursor cell by treating the precursor cells with different signalling molecules that control how astrocytes are made in the embryonic spinal cord. The two types of astrocytes had very different characters in tissue culture and remarkably different effects on the spinal repair process.         One type of astrocyte called GDAsBMP was remarkably effective at promoting nerve regeneration and recovery of limb motion when transplanted into spinal cord injuries.         'So far 27 out of 27 spinal injured rats that received these cells have achieved scores in a sensitive test of coordinated limb movement that were statistically indistinguishable from their pre-injury scores, and all within 2 to 4 weeks,' Dr Davies said.         However, the other type of astrocyte cell generated called GDAsCNTF, not only failed to promote nerve fibre regeneration or recovery of movement but also caused pain, a severe side effect.         'This is the first time that two distinct sub-types of astrocyte support cells generated from a common stem cell-like precursor cell have been shown to have robustly different effects when transplanted into the injured adult nervous system,' co-author Dr Mayer-Proschel said.         Dr Davies said: 'It has long been a concern that therapies that promote growth of nerve fibres in the injured spinal cord would also cause sprouting of pain circuits.         'However, by using GDAsBMP to repair spinal cord injuries we can have all the gains without the pain, while these other cell types appear to provide the opposite - pain but no gain.'         Controlling the development of stem cells immediately before transplanting them into injured spinal cords is essential because doctors cannot rely on the injured tissues of the body to create the right types of cells from 'naïve' stem cells.         Co-author Mark Noble said 'These studies are particularly exciting in addressing two of the most significant challenges to the field of stem cell medicine - defining the optimal cell for tissue repair and identifying means by which inadequately tested potential therapies may actually cause harm.'"
telegraph,5/1/2006 0:01,news,"The ability to recreate breast cancer in the laboratory, understand why the cancer can recur in treated women and even grow replacement breast tissue could result from the discovery of a 'mammary gland stem cell' reported today by scientists.          Stem cells are the parents of other cell types in the body. Rare mammary stem cells, isolated in mice, are the originators of breast tissue.          Remarkably, two teams report today that it is possible to reconstruct an entire organ from a stem cell, which in this case is the branched ducts and structures made of so called epithelial tissue in a milk producing breast.          The discovery lays an important foundation for understanding how normal breast tissue develops. It could also provide clues about how breast cancer occurs and how rogue tumour cells can evade treatment to cause a recurrence.          Under normal circumstances, the newly identified breast stem cell will produce healthy tissue. But it is believed that an accumulation of genetic errors, perhaps combined with external influences and a family predisposition, could cause the breast stem cell or a 'daughter' cell to produce faulty cells. The errant breast cell can then become a tumour factory.          The research from two teams, one in Australia and one in Canada, is reported today in the journal Nature.          Mammary stem cells were thought to exist because of the way breasts can be regenerated in mice from transplanted fragments of tissue. Both teams showed that the new stem cell is capable of generating an entire breast. Laboratory tests showed they could renew themselves, and form the different cell types found in the mammary gland.          It will take time to translate these findings to human breast tissue, said Dr Connie Eaves of the Terry Fox Laboratory, in Vancouver. 'We expect there will be differences between human and mouse breast tissue that may make rapid translation of our findings to human problems a significant challenge.'          The team led by Dr Jane Visvader, from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Parkville, Australia, found molecular markers to identify the elusive cells and discovered that the cells were more numerous in pre-cancerous tissue. This finding strongly suggests they are involved in breast cancer.          'The real impact of our findings is in providing a new basis for understanding the cell which gives rise to breast cancer - and the possibility of developing novel drugs that target this cell,' said Dr Visvader.          She emphasised that the use of this discovery to regrow breast tissue was a 'remote future possibility' because fat and connective tissue would have to be grown for a true reconstruction and because the conditions that could help grow breast tissue could also spur tumour development.          For many years, scientists and doctors have been puzzled at why women whose breast cancer cells have been apparently eliminated by chemotherapy sometimes suffer a recurrence of their cancer.          Chemotherapy works by targeting cells that are dividing rapidly, which is typical behaviour of cancer cells. But an errant stem-like cell may be more resistant to chemotherapy because it divides more slowly. So while chemotherapy can eliminate the bulk of cancer cells, the tumour factory itself - a breast cancer stem cell - may survive months or years later.           'It is likely that the cancers we can't cure have already become so abnormal by the time they are diagnosed that one treatment will not kill all of the 'cancer stem cells',' said Dr Eaves.          Prof Alan Ashworth, Director of The Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Research Centre in London, said: 'This excellent piece of work lays the foundations for innovative new ways of treating and preventing breast cancer.'                                     Women who have breast cancer surgery face an increased risk of complications or even death if their hospital is among those that conduct the operations less frequently, a specialist warned yesterday.               A study of more than 1,300 women in Korea found that 95 per cent of those re-admitted to hospital had been treated at units doing fewer than 100 procedures a year.               Prof Ian Fentiman, from Guy's Hospital, London, expressed concern and said: 'It has a significant impact. The days of the occasional breast cancer surgeon are coming to an end.'

telegraph,20/08/2003 00:01,news,"The announcement that human embryo 'stem cells' have been grown in King's College London puts Britain at the forefront of a worldwide effort to develop new treatments, and even cures, for many common ailments, from heart disease to Parkinson's and diabetes.In the wake of the ballyhoo that greeted the news, most people will not realise that two teams have achieved the feat: rivals in Newcastle also isolated the elusive cells but delayed publicity to conduct an additional, definitive, test. 'We lost the race to publicise this work,' said Alastair Balls, chief executive of the Centre for Life , Newcastle.Human embryonic stem cells have rarely been out of the headlines since they were first isolated in 1998 by a team in Wisconsin. These 'master' cells can be turned into all the 200 or so different types in the body, offering vast potential for treating diseases (though, inevitably, the research has been condemned by pro-life groups as morally wrong).The embryos in question look like a hollow ball, barely visible to the human eye. Within them are 25 or so cells, the 'inner cell mass' containing the stem cells that form the embryo (the rest make the placenta). From the inner mass, the lines of stem cells have been grown. However, the feat has proved extraordinarily difficult: not only do researchers need 'green fingers' to succeed, they also have to guard against infection, contamination or colonies changing into nerve or other tissue.The race to isolate Britain's first fully characterised line of human embryonic stem cells was between teams in Edinburgh and Sheffield and those led by Prof Tom Strachan and Prof Alison Murdoch at the Centre for Life, Newcastle, and Dr Stephen Minger and Dr Susan Pickering at King's.Last week, the King's team reported success in the internet journal Reproductive BioMedicine Online and described how its line makes two molecules unique to human embryonic stem cells, as well other genes commonly found in other stem cells.The Newcastle team has been growing its stem cells since the start of the year but delayed publishing results so it could implant the cells into mice that lack an immune system to see if the cells turn into teratomas, cancers that consist of a blend of all cell types. This study, which will take a month or two, is regarded as a crucial test to show the cells are 'pluripotent' - that is, capable of turning into any type. 'We did not feel we could publish until this test had been done,' said Prof Murdoch. 'You have to be careful not to make announcements that are premature' - as happened when the BBC claimed last August that the King's team had pulled off the feat. That cell line was subsequently lost to contamination.Dr Minger's team felt that it was worth publicising its work before tests for pluripotency had been carried out because its stem cells came from an unusual source: while Newcastle used embryos left over from IVF because they were poor quality, King's used embryos that had failed screening tests (preimplantation genetic diagnosis) for serious genetic disease.Both cell lines will be deposited in Britain's stem cell bank, run by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, in South Mimms, to ensure that maximum use will be made of as few human embryos as possible. They add to the 37 lines of human embryo cells isolated worldwide, of which a dozen are already of sufficient quality to freeze in the bank. One advantage of home-grown lines is that their use will not incur charges.Both Prof Murdoch and Dr Minger have played down the race to be first. 'We have been very supportive of the Newcastle team,' said Dr Minger, explaining how his rivals were in fact colleagues and how he had given them advice on how to store their cells. Prof Murdoch added: 'What is important is that Britain is now in a position to be the world leader.'

telegraph,8/1/2009 17:00,news,"The body's healing system could be 'supercharged' after a new discovery which gives people with heart disease or broken bones new hope of a better, faster recovery.British researchers have developed a technique that boosts the number of repair cells released by the body after a major injury or disease.The discovery means more than 100 times the amount of cells are released, and the scientists hope the breakthrough could lead to speedier recoveries from serious injuries, heart attacks and other organ failures.When a person has a disease or an injury, their bone marrow mobilises different types of stem cells to help repair and regenerate tissue around the affected area. The new research, by Imperial College London, shows that a combination of drugs will boost this response.The technique, which has been successful in mice, uses new drug combinations to put the bone marrow into a state of 'red alert' and send specific kinds of stem cells into action.Dr Sara Rankin, the author of the study from the National Heart & Lung Institute at Imperial College London, said: 'The body repairs itself all the time. We know that the skin heals over when we cut ourselves and, similarly, inside the body there are stem cells patrolling around and carrying out repair where it's needed. 'However, when the damage is severe, there are limits to what the body can do of its own accord. We hope that by releasing extra stem cells, as we were able to do in mice in our new study, we could potentially call up extra numbers of whichever stem cells the body needs, in order to boost its ability to mend itself and accelerate the repair process.' The team, which reported its findings in the journal Cell Stem Cell, believe they will eventually be able to target different kinds of stem cells depending on the repairs that are needed.The researchers also hope that they could tackle auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, where the body is attacked by its own immune system, by mobilising special stem cells that suppress the immune system.The researchers now want to investigate whether releasing repair stem cells into the blood really does accelerate the rate and degree of tissue regeneration in mice that have had a heart attack. Depending on the outcome of this work, they hope to conduct clinical trials of the new drug combinations in humans within the next 10 years.  Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, which partly funded the research, said it might be possible to 'encourage the right number and type of stem cells to enter the circulation and repair damage to the heart'.

telegraph,4/4/2002 0:01,news,"THE Great Ormond Street team is the first in Britain to succeed with gene therapy, a revolutionary treatment that has seen many false dawns since the hospital made its first attempt almost a decade ago.'We are very relieved . . . we are ecstatic,' said the head of the London team, Dr Adrian Thrasher, who has spent years developing the technique.However, Dr Thrasher said it was too early to speak of a 'cure' for Rhys, who will be monitored for the rest of his life to check that the gene transplant continues to work.Gene therapy delivers a normal gene to the cells that need it - in this case stem cells in the bone marrow which make all blood cells, including the immune cells that Rhys lacked.Rhys is one of two patients who have taken part in the hospital's first trials of gene therapy for X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, X-SCID, the commonest form of disease that strips the body of the ability to fight infections.The hospital, which plans to extend the work to other immune deficiency diseases, said it did not have permission to discuss the second male toddler, who was treated 12 weeks ago.Rhys carries a single faulty gene that means his body fails to make white blood cells - T cells and natural killer cells - that fight infection, causing a range of problems, placing him at risk of pneumonia and other diseases, and stunting his growth.Hopes that gene therapy would work were raised two years ago when a French team published research that showed how a similar type of gene therapy had released three boys with the same condition from imprisonment in sterile 'bubbles'.Through gene therapy, Rhys's bone marrow was genetically modified with a normal copy of his faulty gene before being infused back into him to rebuild his immune system.In the procedure, 100 millilitres of bone marrow were removed from his hip bone, under general anaesthetic, and incubated for a week with a bag of genetically-altered mouse retrovirus, which carries the normal gene but is unable to multiply in the body.The virus designed by the Institute of Child Health was similar to the one used by the French team, though it was modified to bind more efficiently to bone marrow stem cells.The corrected bone marrow was then infused into Rhys in the hope that his stem cells would start to use the implanted gene to rebuild his immune system. Studies now show that his white blood cell count has returned to normal, said Dr Thrasher.Rhys, designated Patient One, is 'off his therapy, thriving, growing normally and indistinguishable from any other boy of his age,' said Dr Thrasher. 'Patient Two is improving, at home, and he is still on medication, which is to be expected at this stage.'However, there is a theoretical risk that the inserted genes could disrupt the action of others to cause cancer."
telegraph,19/12/2014 18:14,news,"The NHS could start prescribing stem-cell therapies within the near future after the European Medicines Agency gave the go ahead for the first treatment The first stem-cell therapy has been approved by European regulators in a   major step forward for advanced medicine in Britain. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended Holoclar, a treatment in   which a patient’s own healthy stem cells are used to grow new cells which   are then transplanted into the eye. It is a major step forward for stem-cell therapies which have so far being   confined to the lab and clinical trials. Experts predicted advanced   treatments will be available on the NHS within a few years. “This is exciting both because there are no other treatments for this sort of   damage to the eye and because this is the first example in which a   ‘medicine’ based on stem cells has been approved for use in humans,”   Professor Graham McGeown, Reader in Physiology, Centre for Experimental   Medicine, Queen's University Belfast. “Because the cells come from the patient themselves, there should be no   worries that the body will reject them as can happen when using a transplant   from another person. “This treatment will only be allowed under carefully defined conditions,   however, so that the outcomes can be carefully monitored to see if the   treatment works and doesn’t have any unexpected side-effects.”Stem cells can act as a repair system for the body. Limbal stem cells are located in the eye at the border between the cornea –   the clear front part of the eye - and the sclera – the white of the eye. Physical or chemical burns can cause loss of these stem cells, resulting in   limbal stem cell deficiency, LSCD, a condition that is estimated to affect   about 3.3 out of 100,000 people in the European Union and around 650 people   in Britain. Symptoms include pain, sensitivity to light, inflammation, excessive blood   vessel growth, clouding of the cornea, and eventually blindness. In LSCD the limbal stem cells become so diminished that they eyes can no   longer make new cells to repair damage. The new treatment takes a small sample of the patients healthy cornea, removes   the stem cells and grows them until there are sufficient numbers to put back   into the eye. The cells themselves then repair the damage. Moorfields Eye Hospital in London has successfully treated around 20 people   with Holocar so far in trials. Prof Chris Mason, from University College London, told the BBC: 'This   move would enable far more people to access it, you could now prescribe this.'The EMA decision to approve Holoclar will now be sent to the European   Commission for market authorization. It will then be up to Nice to decide   whether to approve the therapy for use on the NHS. Dr Dusko Ilic, Reader in Stem Cell Science, King's College London, said: “The   therapeutic approach on which Holoclar is based is relatively well   established and it was just a question of when it would be approved by   regulatory agencies. “It has been performed in multiple academic institutions around the world,   including the UK. I hope that Holoclar is not just an exception, and that   many more cellular therapy products will see market in the next year.”Holoclar, has been developed by the Italian pharmaceutical company Chiesi   Farmaceutici S.p.A. Enrica Alteri, Head of EMA’s Human Medicines Evaluation Division said the   decision represented a ‘major step forward’ for stem cell therapies. "
telegraph,25/03/2006 00:01,news,"The number of human embryos needed for medical research could be greatly reduced following the announcement yesterday that doctors have found that testicular cells can turn into a wide range of other types found in the body.          Scientists are already investigating the use of stem cells from early human embryos for a wide range of treatments because they are able to multiply endlessly and to recreate all 200 basic cell types in the body.          But a forthcoming study in the journal Nature will describe how a team in Germany, where such embryo research is forbidden, has successfully isolated highly flexible stem cells from adult mouse testes that exhibit properties similar to embryonic stem cells.          Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, the head of developmental genetics at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research, said: 'This is a very exciting piece of work. These findings would also overcome barriers for scientists in countries with regulations that restrict work with human embryonic stem cells, such as Germany.'          But, he added 'it does not make all the ethical issues go away - they could equally be used to make animal-human chimeras'.          The team which reports the advance, led by Prof Gerd Hasenfuss of the Georg-August-University of Goettingen, show that the testis cells are remarkably flexible: capable of forming all three 'germ layers' - the basic three cellular layers, ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm - from which the body's organs and tissues develop.          They show another crucial property of embryonic stem cells: when injected into mice that lack an immune system, the cells grow into teratomas, tumours formed of a blend of all different types.          And, when the cells were blended with those of an early mouse embryo, they were found to contribute to many tissues, such as heart, brain and spleen, in the mice that were born.          Prof Hasenfuss, Dr Kaomei Guan and colleagues propose that these cells, which may be extracted from men using a simple testicular biopsy, could provide an alternative source of stem cells for growing brain or heart cells to treat a male patient that would not trigger any immune reaction.          This would avoid the technical and ethical difficulties associated with generating stem cells from human embryos, which has been bitterly opposed by the pro-life movement.          Dr Stephen Minger, of King's College London, said: 'This is pretty amazing. We would need to replicate this in humans because, while it works in mice it may not work in people.'          Dr Raanan Gillon, Emeritus Professor of Medical Ethics at Imperial College London, called it 'a welcome development encouraging those who object to the use of human embryonic stem cells to pursue research with human testicular stem cells'."
telegraph,29/09/2004 00:05,news,"The scientist who created Dolly the sheep yesterday applied to clone human embryos to aid the development of an effective treatment for motor neurone disease, the devastating degenerative disorder.          Prof Ian Wilmut applied for a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to isolate stem cells from cloned human embryos with the disease.          The stem cells, parent cells of all types in the body, would be grown into the nerve cells, the motor neurons, along which the brain sends signals to muscles over distances of up to a metre.          The application was lodged yesterday by Prof Wilmut of the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, with an expert in motor neurone disease, Prof Christopher Shaw of the Institute of Psychiatry, London.          MND is a 'horrific' illness, said Prof Shaw. 'I have seen at least three people in their twenties with the disease in the last year and they died very quickly.'          The application was attacked by pro-life groups yesterday but supporters say the research will create 'entirely new opportunities' to combat the disease, which kills more than 1,000 people each year.          Prof Wilmut said: 'We owe it to the people who suffer from it and are going to suffer from it in the future to try to develop treatments.'          Even though the disease was characterised 130 years ago, the mechanisms that destroy motor neurons are not well understood.          Prof Shaw said the use of human stem cells could eventually help cut the use of animals in developing treatments.          Prof Wilmut added that he hoped to have a response from the HFEA early next year and stressed: 'We are not talking about producing a baby.'          If granted, research could start next Easter. It would be only the second time scientists in Britain have been given the go-ahead to clone human embryos for research.          To date, there have only been modest improvements in slowing MND, said Dr Brian Dickie, director of research from the Motor Neurone Disease Association, adding that yesterday's proposal has 'huge potential'.          A major development came a decade ago with the isolation of a gene, SOD1, but it is only responsible for two per cent of cases.          Overall, only 10 per cent of cases are thought to be hereditary. The remaining 90 per cent are 'sporadic' cases linked to environmental and genetic factors.          There is evidence that motor neurons are killed by the build-up of protein, as also occurs in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, so this work could have much wider implications, said Prof Shaw.          The project has three elements. The team first wants to isolate stem cells from surplus IVF embryos to grow motor neurons.          For comparison, the team then wants to insert the SOD1 gene into the stem cells and grow them into motor neurons to reveal early effects of the disease.          In the third element, the team wants to clone an embryo with the disease, by emptying human eggs that are surplus to IVF programmes and introducing genetic material from a cell from a patient with MND.          From stem cells isolated from the microscopic human cloned embryo at the age of about six days the team will derive nerve cells, including motor neurons, to shed light on the cause of other hereditary forms of the disease.          Stem cells offer 'to transform the way we can identify drugs that may be effective,' Prof Shaw said.          Using them, up to 100,000 possible drugs could be tested each year at a cost of £10,000 - £20,000. In comparison, tests of one drug on patients take two to three years at a cost of £10 million.          It would require another application to the HFEA to obtain permission to clone embryos for stem cell treatments. 'This is very much in the future,' Prof Shaw said.          Dr Donald Bruce, director of the Society, Religion and Technology Project in Edinburgh, said: 'We don't think anyone should be doing cell cloning research until at least there is a UN ban on reproductive human cloning.'          A spokesman for Life, the pro-life group, said similar work could be carried out on adult stem cells. 'We hope scientists will be able to discover treatments for all kinds of conditions, including motor neurone disease, but not through the deliberate manufacture and destruction of human embryos.'

telegraph,19/11/2008 20:22,news,"The transplant of a human windpipe grown from stem cells is a surgical breakthrough of almost limitless potentialThe science of healing is developing so quickly that it has become almost a   cliché to describe a particular operation as a 'breakthrough'.   Yet there is no doubt that the first successful transplant of a human   windpipe, constructed partly from stem cells, is an astonishing milestone –   one that could indeed mark the start of a new era in medicine.At long last, the glint in a researcher's eye has been turned into a   significant advance in the clinic. Forget all the fuss about embryos and   angst about playing God: this is unadulterated good news. We have proved   that scientists can now fashion organs using a patient's own cells,   eliminating the problems with rejection that have always plagued   transplants. Today it is a trachea – tomorrow it could be a colon, even a   heart.The venture was a textbook example of international collaboration, drawing on   the talents of teams in Spain, Italy and Britain. To recap; the operation,   on 30-year-old tuberculosis patient Claudia Castillo, took place in   Barcelona, where doctors also had collected a three-inch segment of trachea   from a 51-year-old donor who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage. They used a   technique developed in Padua to strip the windpipe of its donor's original   cells, a procedure that took six weeks, to create a 'scaffold'. At   the same time, a team in Bristol used a 'bioreactor' dreamt up in   Milan to grow stem cells removed from Castillo's bone marrow. These cells   were 'seeded' into the donated windpipe, disguising the 'foreign'   tissue that remained so Castillo's body would accept it as her own.There is a desperate need for this kind of advance. In Britain, about 8,000   people are on the waiting list for an organ transplant. Around 3,200 such   operations are carried out every year – but roughly 1,000 of those on the   list will die before they get a transplant. And that is only the start of   the problem: after a transplant, there is a high risk of rejection as the   recipient's immune system reacts against the donor organ. Immunosuppressant   drugs are used to limit this but their side-effects include high blood   pressure, diabetes and kidney failure, vulnerability to infections,   osteoporosis, and cancer. In all, the drugs cut life expectancy by an   average of 10 years.As we now know, Claudio Castillo experienced no such problems: two months   after the surgery, which took place in June, her lungs were functioning just   as well as those of most young women her age. The result, says Martin   Birchall, professor of surgery at Bristol University, leaves us 'on the   verge of a new age in surgical care'. But what will that new age look   like? Even before this week's announcement, there has been a steady trickle   of advances that reveal the potential of this medical revolution. There are   attempts to free insulin-dependent diabetics from reliance on needles, by   using injections of their own stem cells. Trials are under way in Britain on   more than 90 patients to test the use of stem cells to help repair damaged   hearts. Prof John Martin of University College London who is leading the   project, says things are 'going well'.We can now routinely grow replacement skin (used to aid wound healing), using   the foreskins of newborns, while Dr Anthony Atala, of the Institute for   Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, has made   and successfully implanted segments of bladder in seven patients, aged   between four and 19, who had a congenital birth defect.Dr Atala's technique is a variation on that used to create Claudia Castillo's   new windpipe. He began by taking biopsy samples of muscle cells and the   cells that line the bladder walls. These were multiplied in the laboratory   until there were enough to seed a special biodegradable 'scaffold',   shaped like a bladder, on which the cells could hang. About eight weeks   after the biopsy, the 'engineered' patches were sewn on to the   patients' original bladders, dramatically improving their function.The significance of the new work, however, is that the pan-European team was   able to transplant an organ, albeit just a section of it. The implications   are staggering: given that stem cells from bone marrow can be grown into any   one family of tissues, such as muscle, bone, skin and cartilage (though not   mucosal or nerve tissues), the team at Bristol University believes the same   approach will allow it to recreate colons and bladders, too. With funding,   Prof Birchall says that he hopes to engineer a larynx for transplant within   five years.The liver will be trickier. The plumbing and cells involved are intricate and   the result of an equally complex series of stages of development. The   process is further complicated by the fact that the liver also needs to have   blood pumping through it at high pressure and volume to work properly. Even   so, the science-fiction vision of organ farms in which spare body parts can   be plucked off the rack may not be so far-fetched. 'I do believe the   various issues are soluble,' said Prof Birchall, though he is reluctant   to speculate on precisely when.In much of this work, Europe is leading the way. 'By putting our brains   together,' says Prof Martin, 'we are ahead of the US in the   clinical application of stem cells.' But remarkable work on the other side of the Atlantic is raising the   possibility that the development of a replacement heart is closer to   fruition than previously hoped. In January, the world's first beating,   retooled 'bioartificial heart' was unveiled by researchers at the   University of Minnesota, an achievement that could pave the way for new   treatments for the 22 million people worldwide who live with heart failure.While there had been advances in growing heart tissue in the lab, the problem   has been how to create a three-dimensional scaffold for the new cells that   mimics the complicated architecture and intricacies of the body's   circulatory system. That is why Prof Doris Taylor and her team in Minnesota   resorted to 'decellularisation': using detergent to remove all of   the cells from an organ. In this case, they used the heart from an animal   cadaver, leaving only the framework between the cells intact, along with the   essential plumbing and heart valves.After successfully removing all the cells from rat hearts, the researchers   then took immature versions of those cells and introduced them to the   decellularised heart scaffolds. Four days later, contractions were observed,   and eight days later the new, partly artificial hearts were pumping, albeit   at only two per cent of the efficiency of an adult heart.Professor Taylor says that she is thrilled by the news of the trachea   transplant. 'We congratulate the Bristol team wholeheartedly – so to   speak – and are excited to see this add credence to the technology used by   our group in its research, and others around the world.' The method,   she believes, can be extended to virtually any organ with a blood supply: 'We   have made significant progress showing the utility of decellularisation for   a number of organs including livers, muscle, skin and kidneys, and are well   on the way to building complex new organs.' Her own team is tackling   the problems involved in rebuilding the vessels in the heart – critical if   you are going to engineer something with a blood supply.And then there is the astonishing potential of embryonic stem cells, the means   by which Mother Nature fashions our entire bodies. Our understanding of how   to guide the development of an embryonic stem cell is primitive – but unlike   the bone marrow cells used in the Castillo case, embryonic stem cells can   turn into any one of the 200 or more different cell types in our bodies,   rendering the opportunities potentially limitless. As Prof Austin Smith of   Cambridge University points out, much more work must be done to determine   how to make them grow the right way, and then to mould them into organs.   Even so, the potential in terms of replacement body parts – or even   replacement bodies – is vast.The path ahead is difficult: more funding and much testing, will be needed and   there will inevitably be false starts and blind alleys. But in the long   term, a brave new world beckons, where row upon row of hearts, kidneys and   lungs are grown in sterile vessels, ready for transplant. Medically and   ethically, the bottom line is simple: if we follow the path blazed by   Claudia Castillo and her doctors, no one need ever die waiting for a donated   organ again.• Roger Highfield is the Editor of 'New Scientist' "
telegraph,25/08/2010 07:55,news,"The US Justice Department has said it will appeal against a judge's decision to block federal funding for stem cell research, risking an election-year battle over an issue that bitterly divides conservatives and liberals.Shortly before the department’s announcement, a spokesman for the Barack Obama   administration said the president wanted to “keep important, potentially   life-saving research moving forward in the most ethical way possible”.Mr Obama had authorized the renewal of federal funding in one of his first   executive orders after taking over in January 2009, reversing a   controversial ban imposed by his predecessor George W Bush in 2001 on moral   and religious grounds.In lifting the ban, Mr Obama rejected what he said was a 'false choice'   between sound science and moral values.But in a ruling issued on Monday, US District Judge Royce Lambert sided with a   group of litigators that included several Christian organizations who argued   that federal funding would be used for research that involved destroying   human embryos, in violation of a 1996 law.Scientists saw the latest turn as a dismaying setback for research that is   believed to hold great potential for treatment of diseases like diabetes,   Alzheimers and Parkinson's.'I was stunned,' said Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes   of Health, which sets the rules for stem cell research funded by the federal   government.'This decision has the potential to do serious damage to one of the more   promising areas of biomedical research and just at a time when we were   gaining momentum,' he said.Calling the consequences of the ruling 'dramatic and far reaching,' Mr Collins   said 50 grant proposals that were awaiting peer review have been pulled, and   as much as $74 million in grants for other projects had been frozen.'If this decision stands, very promising research on human diseases for which   we need new insights and new options will not get done,' he said.Kurt Civin, director of the University of Maryland's Center for Stem Cell   Biology and Regenerative Medicine, said institutions around the country were   scrambling to understand the implications of the ruling and determine how   their research projects might be affected.Not all stem cell research would stop because there were still state and   private sources of funding.Researchers believe that stem cells, so-called because they are the foundation   for all human cells, provide two promising avenues for scientists.First, they can be used for research that cannot be performed inside the body.   But scientists believe they can also coax the foundational cells into   cardiac, pancreatic or brain cells to replace damaged or infected cells and   allow tissue or organs to reconstitute themselves.There are three types of stem cells currently being examined for their   potential medical research value.Embryonic stem cells, which are extracted from human embryos; adult stem   cells, which are taken from the body or from elements discarded after birth,   such the umbilical cord; and induced pluripotent stem cells - adult stem   cells that have been genetically modified to resemble embryonic stem cells.

telegraph,27/05/2006 00:01,news,"Three women have had breast cancer surgery in which their own stem cells were implanted to help grow new tissue to repair the damage.          Around the world scientists are investigating the potential of stem cells - parent cells that have the potential to develop into other types, in this case blood vessels to help grafts to take.          Stem cells derived from the women's fat (adipose) tissue was implanted this week after cancer surgery in an attempt to improve reconstruction.          The trial on 20 women is being conducted by a team led by Dr Keizo Sugimachi, president of Kyushu Central Hospital in Fukuoka Japan, in conjunction with the American company Cytori Therapeutics.          A partial mastectomy, where part of the breast is removed in keyhole surgery followed by radiation treatment, can be effective in the treatment of breast cancer but often results in significant skin damage and tissue loss.           The team believes that the stem cells will create new blood vessels to help fat tissue implanted at the same time to survive. 'Adipose tissue is a rich source for stem cells and other regenerative cells that are believed to contribute to repair and healing,' said Dr Sugimachi.          'Adipose-derived stem and regenerative cells could potentially offer breast cancer patients the option to use their own cells to restore a natural breast contour following surgery, obviating the need for an implant or complicated surgical procedure.'          Yesterday, a woman in her forties, the third this week, took part in a feasibility study on breast cancer patients who had undergone a partial mastectomy, said Dr Kitamura Kaoru, a surgeon.          She said she expected to know within six months if the stem cell reconstructions had been successful.          Each woman had a small volume of fatty tissue removed from one or more of the body's normal deposits, using a glorified version of liposuction. Using the 'celution system' method developed by Cytori, the team extracted and concentrated a stem cell-enriched fraction and injected it into the affected breast after fat had been implanted to replace the cancerous tissue.          'The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the safety of adipose-derived stem and regenerative cells,' said Dr Marc Hedrick, the president of Cytori. 'We believe the effect of the celution output is safe and may improve the appearance of the breast after cancer surgery.'           Dr Hedrick's team at the University of California, Los Angeles, was the first to report that stem cells reside in adipose tissue. The celution system is designed to isolate and concentrate a patient's stem cells from adipose tissue in about an hour.           Earlier this year, his team announced animal experiments that suggested that the stem cells, in combination with a fat graft, improved survival of the transplanted tissue.          'Adipose stem and regenerative cells improve the long-term viability of soft tissue transfer, which holds promising implications for breast reconstruction,' said Dr Hedrick.          In the pre-clinical study, fat tissue transfers were performed in 30 animals, which were divided into three groups of 10. A supplement of adipose stem and regenerative cells was injected into the grafts of half of the animals in each group.          After six months, a statistically significant, three-times greater weight retention was observed in the grafts injected with adipose stem and regenerative cells compared with the control group. "

The helix: the human genome race is heating up          Much less has been said about a tussle behind closed doors in Britain, now in its final stages, that could have huge implications for how the human genome is exploited here in the years ahead.On one side of the dispute is the NHS - whose clinical genetics laboratories currently test patients for cancer-causing mutations in the genes involved in inherited forms of breast and ovarian cancers. On the other is an American biotechnology company Myriad Genetics - which is expected to be granted a UK patent on one of the genes - called BRCA1 - any time now. The wrangle between them raises medical, legal, commercial and philosophical issues.Mutations in this gene and another - BRCA2 - are responsible for up to 10 per cent of all breast and ovarian cancers. Women with BRCA mutations have a far higher risk of developing one of these cancers than the rest of the female population.A gene test can put a patient's mind at rest, or lead to preventive measures against disease. But there's widespread concern about the potential impact of a private company monopolising the gene testing. There are fears too that as more companies claim rights to genes discovered, testing for and treating inherited diseases could be a legal minefield.'This case sets a precedent and how the Department of Health deals with it will be vital,' says Dr Gareth Evans, a clinical geneticist at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester. 'Myriad could shut down every genetics laboratory in the country. There are a large number of genes that are exploitable and biotechnology companies could cherry-pick the relatively common ones to make money out of them,' he says. 'The result would be that all that the NHS labs are left with are the rare ones that are more difficult to make a case for. Certain health authorities will say 'we won't do gene testing, we'll spend the money on something else'.'Myriad has licensed an Edinburgh-based biotechnology company, Rosgen, to carry out the testing in Britain and the service is due to be introduced this month. 'It's getting quite urgent now,' says Dr Shirley Hodgson, of the genetics testing laboratory at Guy's Hospital, London. 'It could all happen quite soon.'Her concern is that if Myriad were allowed to take over testing, it could increase the cost. She maintains also that the way the NHS laboratories currently counsel patients and carry out tests is crucial.A position statement is expected soon from a group representing clinicians in the field, the Cancer Genetics Group. Professor John Burn of Newcastle University, the group's chairman, accepts there are some potential benefits from involving the private sector in gene testing - patients could lose out if the NHS can't afford to invest in the new technology needed to develop and carry out gene testing to the highest standards. But there are also dangers.'We currently offer about 30 to 40 different diagnostic tests but there are many hundreds coming along,' he says. 'It's fairly common sense that if one actually allows external forces such as an American company to say 'you aren't allowed to do this any more - send them all to us', the danger is that they decide to stop doing it, or decide to increase the price and you've got no choice but to accept that. There is also the danger that the high profile diseases such as breast cancer might get a diagnostic service, but the less high profile diseases are less likely to be given the service.'There's widespread relief that the problem relates only to BRCA1. Myriad's claims to the second gene BRCA2 have been curtailed in this country by the Cancer Research Campaign, the charity that funded the British team involved in finding the gene, which has BRCA2 patents in Europe and America. After threats of legal action last year, both parties are now on speaking terms and the CRC is considering a cross-licensing deal with Rosgen.Rosgen won't discuss its position on BRCA1 while negotiations continue. But it is thought that NHS labs will be allowed to continue some testing under licence.Biotechnology companies have applied for patents on tens of thousands of human genes. The US Patent Office has already granted about 1,000, and the European directive that permits human gene patenting comes into effect in July. The UK Patent Office is currently consulting on the issue. The medical charity, the Wellcome Trust, says it will consider mounting a legal challenge to any patents granted that are so broad they inhibit research into new tests and treatments. The patent system is supposed to promote innovation by providing its practitioners with the protection they need to recoup their investment in research and development. But the jury is still out on whether gene patenting will encourage or stifle it.     Christine McGourty is Technology Correspondent for BBC News.   "
telegraph,15/03/2001 00:00,news,"   Decoding our DNA has huge social and ethical implications that will be explored during Science Week. Roger Highfield reports   THE worldwide effort to make sense of the human genetic code stirs mixed feelings in many people: the quest to decode the 'Book of Mankind' has been hailed as the Holy Grail of medicine, yet history has seen terrible things done in the name of genetics.                               Holy grail: there are growing public concerns over the human genome project          Despite the growing sense of excitement among scientists about the impact of the work on biology and medicine, there is a widespread realisation that genetics is socially and ethically sensitive and that public concerns cannot be defused by citing scientific facts alone. Science may tell you what is possible but it cannot tell you what is desirable.Some of the events among the 7,000 planned for Science Week, which begins on Friday, will weigh up the implications of the human genome project, already the subject of studies by organisations such as the Wellcome Trust and Medical Research Council. Does understanding our DNA bring us any closer to Socrates's admonition to 'know thyself'? Are we wise enough to mould ourselves to the extent that new technology may allow? Will it lead to genetic discrimination or even 'genetic hypochondria', where some people will spend a lifetime expecting a disease that never arrives? And will the 'post-genomic era' place too much emphasis on our genes as the only component that makes up our 'humanness'?The latest attempt to examine public attitudes to human genetic information, a MORI survey of 1,000 people, was conducted on behalf of the Human Genetics Commission, which will be issuing advice to ministers on topics such as genetics and insurance and police DNA databases over the next few months.Chairman of the commission, Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, said: 'These findings give us an intriguing insight into people's hopes and worries about future developments in genetic technology. Many people are looking forward to what the future might bring but at the same time there are a number of important reservations.' The findings include:     Three people in 10 believe that couples who are at risk of having a child with a serious genetic disorder should be discouraged from having children of their own. That is the view of only one in 20 of those aged 16-24, but of more than half of people aged over 55.     While nine out of 10 of the people questioned agreed that genetics should be used to cure disease, a third thought gene research was 'tampering with nature' and unethical. Women are more likely than men to think gene research is unethical (women 37 per cent agree, men 28 per cent), as are Asian respondents, those who say their religion or faith has an influence on the decisions they make, and those who know least about genetics.    People in Scotland are significantly more likely than others in the UK to blame their genes for making them overweight rather than nurture, such as eating deep-fried Mars bars, drinking pints of 'heavy', and so on.    Three-quarters of people feel they have too little information on controls on biological developments, and most have little or no confidence that rules and regulations are keeping pace with new scientific developments.    Four out of five people believe that such information should not be used for setting insurance premiums.    Respondents are wary of the use of genetic testing by employers, in keeping with the findings of previous studies. Seven in 10 feel it is inappropriate for a boss to know the results of a genetic test to see if employees, or potential employees, are likely to succumb to disease or disability.     Almost all - 94 per cent - of respondents think human genetic information should be used to identify and eliminate suspects from police inquiries. While a majority also think it appropriate to take DNA samples from those charged with drink driving or burglary, there is considerably less support for their use with fraud and shoplifting. Opinion is equally divided as to whether samples should be kept on the police database in the event of acquittal.     Black and Asian respondents are significantly less likely than white to agree that new genetic improvements will bring cures for many diseases (78 per cent and 76 per cent respectively, compared with 89 per cent among white respondents). Black and Asian respondents are also significantly less likely than white respondents to trust the police to be responsible users of DNA databases (37 per cent compared with 59 per cent). Three in five (61 per cent) of black respondents feel that samples should be removed from the police DNA database after the individual has been acquitted of the offence for which they were collected. In contrast, half (51 per cent) of Asian respondents support the retention on the database with white respondents evenly split (45 per cent favouring retention of samples, and 49 per cent opposed). Prof Elizabeth Anionwu of Thames Valley University, a member of the HGC, commented: 'The results reveal a number of fascinating cultural differences and views. Not surprisingly understanding of genetics is informed by concerns that have an impact on specific ethnic groups; for example, it is interesting to see that black and Asian respondents are more likely than others to know that thalassaemia is an inherited condition.' As part of Science Week, the Royal Society, with the Wellcome Trust, is hosting a discussion with Baroness Kennedy, Sir John Sulston, Britain's leading genome scientist, and Prof Sir Christopher Evans, a leading biotechnology entrepreneur. Chaired by writer and broadcaster Sheena McDonald, the panel will debate the implications of this momentous achievement with the audience, which will include five readers of The Daily Telegraph who have won an all expenses-paid trip to the event in London on Thursday, March 22, to have their questions discussed. Admission is by ticket only, which may be obtained free from the Royal Society (tel 020 7451 2576 or e-mail public.programme@royalsoc.ac.uk). The same evening, the Royal Institution in London will discuss genetics and insurance (see www.ri.ac.uk, or ring 020 7409 2992). The best way to find out more about Science Week events is to consult the website run by the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which has coordinated the week since 1994 and expects 1.5 million people to take part: the address is www.nationalscienceweek.org.uk  Various gene events are planned by Dr Charlie McDonald of the University of Sheffield; the University of York; St Mary's High School, Chesterfield; James Watt College, Greenock; Swinton Comprehensive, North Yorkshire; University of Sunderland and University of Wales, Swansea. Biomedical ethicist Dr Tom Wilkie will lead an informal discussion on jobs, genes and justice next Monday night over a pint of beer at a 'SciBAr' in the City of London, an attempt to spread the scientific gospel in the form of a boozy debate. There are no invitations to the 6.30pm event and the evening is free, except for what you spend on drink or food at the Fuego Bar, 2/A Eastcheap, a few minutes walk from Monument Tube station.  The winning questions  The five Telegraph readers who have had their genome questions selected for discussion at the Royal Society are:  1. Mrs J Clarke, Worthing Will the Human Genome Project enable medical science to end the ageing process, thus making old people a thing of the past?  2. Mr Robert Chisholm, Bristol Evolution has never introduced a change that paid an immediate penalty for the sake of a later long-term advantage. Does the Human Genome Project challenge current generations to make decisions not for themselves but for their great grandchildren?  3. Mrs June Garrett, Stockport Assuming that we do not want to play about irresponsibly with human diversity, would you nevertheless be in favour of generally raising the standard of intelligence?  4. Miss Erica Callery, Warrington Will the genome be used to help people in disadvantaged countries or will it just benefit the richer countries?  5. Mrs Patricia Moore, Bolton I have a grandson, Jamie, aged 7, who has recently been diagnosed as having Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. The prognosis is that he will be confined to a wheelchair in about 12-18 months and will die in his mid-teens. Will the Human Genome Project lead to medical advances in time to be able to stop Jamie needing a wheelchair, or at least extend his life?   "
telegraph,24/02/2001 00:00,culture,"   The race to map human DNA  LAST June scientists announced that they had completed a rough draft of the human genome. Two weeks ago they published the first analyses of their work.Like the original announcement, the latest events were a mixture of high science and low farce. Analysis had revealed some remarkable facts. Humans possess far fewer genes than originally thought; most of our DNA is 'junk'; and many genes 'double up': they code for more than one protein, and hence play a role in more than one bodily process.But almost before these findings could be discussed, a 'My genome is better than your genome' squabble had broken out between the two groups of scientists who had independently sequenced the genome: the privately financed venture, led by the American maverick Craig Venter; and the international public consortium, co-ordinated by the American geneticist Francis Collins, and funded largely by the US government and Britain's Wellcome Trust.Such was the bad blood between the two groups that they could not even manage to publish their findings jointly. Venter published in the American journal Science, while the public consortium took its findings to the British-based Nature.Like the DNA molecule itself, the race to sequence the human genome comprises intertwined strands, scientific and political. Few people are better placed to unravel these strands than Kevin Davies. A British geneticist, he became the founding editor of the US-based scientific journal Nature Genetics, set up in 1992 largely to tap into the research surrounding the genome project.In The Sequence, Davies provides a compelling overview of that project. The story he tells is of great interest to both the professional biologist and the lay reader. While the former may be frustrated by the 'genetics for beginners' sections in the book, and the latter bogged down in the welter of complex genetical explanations, Davies should manage on the whole to keep both audiences satisfied.Davies is balanced in his assessments of the two sides in the race for what the Harvard geneticist Walter Gilbert has described as biology's 'Holy Grail'. It is all too easy, particularly on this side of the Atlantic, to see it as a conflict between the 'forces of good' - the geneticist Eric Lander's description of the public project - and those driven by naked ambition and a lust for profits.Davies rejects such easy characterisation. The differences between the two sides, he shows, are both scientific and political. The publicly funded consortium set out not to sequence the whole of the genome, but to map out the specific areas where genes are located. Venter, on the other hand, used the 'shotgun' approach: he smashed a sample of DNA into hundreds of fragments, worked out the molecular structure of each, and then used an enormous computer to decide how to fit all the pieces together again. The scientific jury is still out as to which is the better method.Politically, the consortium is committed to making their findings public, and is opposed to the patenting of genes. Venter, as head of a commercial company, Celera, restricts access to his database, charges for the use of it, and is keen to patent commercially important genes. Davies argues that, while free access to data remains critical for the development of science, Venter has nevertheless played an important role in shaking up, and speeding up, the genome project.Davies seems less comfortable with some of the broader, philosophical implications of the project - questions about genetic patenting, for instance, or the issue of whether nature or nurture shapes human behaviour.But if you want a sense of both the excitement of the human genome project, and of its promise, or if you simply want the story of the most important scientific development of the past half century, this book is essential reading.Kenan Malik is the author of ëMan, Beast and Zombie' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson). "
telegraph,23/12/2002 00:01,news," Scientists have grown a miniature human kidney inside a mouse using a technique that could one day mean an end to organ transplants.Although the kidney was tiny, it was functional, suggesting that patients suffering from organ failure might be able to grow replacements.In a paper published yesterday in Nature Medicine, an Israeli team of scientists reveal how they grew organs from kidney precursor cells - stem cells that are destined to become kidney cells.The cells were taken from human and pig foetuses and transplanted into mice where they grew into perfect kidneys, the size of mice kidneys.A spokesman for the team at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot said: 'The miniature human and pig kidneys were functional, producing urine. 'In addition, blood supply within the kidney was provided by host blood vessels as opposed to donor blood vessels, greatly lowering the risk of rejection.'The team, led by Prof Yair Reisner, found that the risks of rejection were lowest if the human cells were tranplanted from a human foetus at seven to eight weeks and a pig foetus at four weeks.If cells are removed any earlier, the kidneys grow erratically and include muscle, bone and cartilage cells. Any later and the risk of rejection is too great.To check how the human immune system might react to the new kidneys, the researchers grew the organs in mice with no immune system at all and injected human lymphocytes, or white blood cells. As long as the kidney stem cells were transplanted at the right time the lymphocytes did not attack the new pig or human kidneys. The study is now in the pre-clinical stage and if all goes well, might be tested in people within the next few years.More than 5,000 people are waiting for kidney transplants in Britain. The shortage of donors is so severe that the Department of Health is actively encouraging live donors.The crisis has prompted scientists to investigate whether patients could grow replacement kidneys from stem cells - the unspecialised 'parent' cells which have yet to differentiate into fully grown tissue or body parts.Researchers are also looking into xenotransplantation, or kidney transplants from genetically modified pigs.A spokesman for the Britain's National Kidney Research Fund said: 'Any scientific advance that will help relieve the chronic shortage of organs can only go towards benefiting patients. If they have been able to do this with stem cells, it is terrific news, although of course these are still very early days.'Because of the ethical issues involved in using foetal stem cells, it is likely that pig stem cells will be more acceptable to doctors and patients. Pig stem cell transplants are thought unlikely to trigger the massive immune rejection found with animal whole organ transplants.Kidneys filter toxins from the blood and excrete them in urine. Each day, the kidneys filter around 200 litres of blood - or the entire blood supply seven or eight times. Common causes of kidney failure include diabetes, mellitus, uncontrolled high blood pressure, drug abuse, cysts, kidney stones and systemic lupus erythematosus."
telegraph,6/9/2005 0:01,news," The ability of stem cells to provide cures for serious diseases has been over-hyped, according to Britain's leading fertility expert.          Prof Robert Winston, professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, is to warn that exaggerated claims made by some scientists about the potential benefits of stem cell therapy could lead to a public backlash.          Barely a week goes by without new and dramatic claims being made for potential therapeutic uses of stem cells, the body's master cells that can form different types of cells.          They are regularly touted as miracle treatments for everything from Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and diabetes to strokes, spinal cord injury and infertility.          In his presidential address at the BA festival of science this evening, Prof Winston will say people are being given unrealistic expectations of new treatments resulting from embryonic stem cell research arriving in the next few years.          He will say: 'The study of stem cells is one of the most exciting areas in biology but I think it is unlikely that embryonic stem cells are likely to be useful in health care for a long time.          'But. . . some parliamentarians were clearly led to believe that a major clinical application was just around the corner. When disappointment sets in, as may be possible, we can expect a massive backlash by the 'right to life' groups who are always so ready to pounce when they perceive a chink in our arguments.'          Prof Winston will outline a series of difficulties with the use of stem cells to provide therapies such as their slow replication in the laboratory and the possibility of faster growing, but abnormal, cells dominating a culture system.          Research to be published today in the journal Nature Genetics adds to evidence of a link between stem cells and cancer.          Dr Cayetano González, whose group began the work at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, found that the disruption of specific stem cell genes led to uncontrolled replication and formation of tumours.          A report to be published today by the think tank Demos argues that closer ties between university science and business is threatening to undermine public confidence in research and distorting research priorities.          James Wilsdon, co-author of the pamplet 'The Public Value of Science', said: 'Collaboration between universities and businesses is important. But we need to ask who is setting the agenda for science.          'There's a real danger that commercial pressures will restrict the openness of academic research and stifle wider debate about the role of science in society.'"
telegraph,1/3/2007 0:01,news,"                                             Embryonic stem cells explained                                             British scientists will be allowed to create part-human, part-animal embryos for research into potentially life-saving medical treatments, the Government signalled yesterday.                                       Caroline Flint, the health minister, is considering removing a ban on such work from a draft bill that will form the basis for new laws on fertility treatment and embryo research.         Two teams of British researchers have applied for permission to create 'cybrid' embryos that would be around 99.9 per cent human and 0.1 per cent rabbit, cow, pig, sheep or goat to produce embryonic stem cells – the body's building blocks that grow into all other types of cells.         They want to use the stem cells to understand and provide new treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cystic fibrosis, motor neurone disease and Huntington's.         A draft bill to replace the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 is currently being drawn up. It is expected to be ready in May and is due to be included in the Queen's speech in November.         A White Paper published by the Department of Health in December stated: 'The Government will propose that the creation of hybrid and chimera embryos in vitro, should not be allowed.         'However the Government also proposes that the law will contain a power enabling regulations to set out circumstances in which the creation of hybrid and chimera embryos in vitro may in future be allowed under licence, for research purposes only.'         Many scientists were left worried that advances they believed could benefit large numbers of patients, especially those with nervous system disorders, would be outlawed and that Britain would lose its position as a world leader in stem cell science. The Commons science and technology select committee announced an inquiry into the issue, while the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority promised a public consultation.         Tony Blair said last month that although there were difficult issues the Government was 'not dead set against' the creation of early hybrid embryos for research.         On Tuesday David King, the Government's chief scientific adviser, told the science committee that research using part-human, part-animal embryos should be allowed under tight controls.         At a hearing of the committee yesterday, Miss Flint was asked by Lib Dem science spokesman Evan Harris whether the draft bill being prepared could differ from the White Paper by not starting out with a presumption that such research be banned.         She replied: 'We will take on board all the views. It is a possibility, yes.'         Miss Flint said that within the field was a spectrum ranging from work that would be unacceptable to most people to other research that would pose less ethical issues, and she appeared to hit back at Sir David over his comments.         She added: 'It could be that some areas, let's take for example the issue of cybrids, can be regulated by a simple process, but some of the other areas of chimeras might pose other questions that nobody might want to do down.'         Dr Calum MacKellar of the Scottish Council on Scottish Bioethics, said: 'Millions of people in the UK would see the creation of animal-human embryo combinations as the creation of very profound ethical problems. These are not just a pile of cells, but have a special moral status as a human person.'"
telegraph,28/06/2007 19:11,news,"                                             First artificial life could be created 'within months'                                              Man could be on the brink of creating the first  artificial organism, a landmark development that would provide a profound insight into the origins, workings and essence of life, and vast new opportunities to exploit living organisms.          The scientist behind the effort, Dr Craig Venter, wants to synthesise new kinds of bug to clean up the environment,  generate biofuels and green energy, even mop up greenhouse gases.          But this pioneering research has inevitably triggered unease about the limits of science, fears about “playing god,” and raises the spectre that this technology could one day be abused.         Today’s work of genetic transmutation underlines how our cells are simply  chemical machines, albeit ones of mind blowing complexity.           Scientists have been tinkering with them for years. Since the 1970s, they have moved genes - instructions to make proteins - between the cells of different organisms.           But today’s announcement marks the first time that the entire instruction set, consisting of more than a million “letters” of pure DNA, with no other associated cellular factors, proteins and machinery, has been transplanted, transforming one species of bacterium into another.          Working at the J Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland, he could draw on a large  team that included Carole Lartigue, Clyde Hutchison, the Nobel laureate Ham Smith and John Glass.          They transplanted one genetic recipe - in the form of naked DNA, an intact genome - of Mycoplasma mycoides into cells of a closely related bacterium, Mycoplasma capricolum.           Both of these goat bugs have small genomes and lack the cell walls typical of many other bacteria, making the transplant easier in principle.           The naked DNA used for the transplant was wrapped up in the form of a bundle, called a chromosome.          After transplant, the recipient cells were reprogrammed with the new genetic instructions on the implanted chromosome so they became identical to the donor cells, the team reports today in the journal Science.          One of its editors called it “a landmark in biological engineering.”          To show the process worked Dr Venter’s team had first added two genes to the genome to be transplanted: one conferred antibiotic resistance, and the other caused bacteria that used it to turn blue.          Within four days of the transplants, blue colonies  of bugs appeared, indicating that a few M. capricolum had indeed taken up the foreign DNA and were following the new instructions, turning it into Mycoplasma mycoides.          In all, of the millions of bacteria that they tried the transplant on, it only worked one time in every 150,000.          Antoine Danchin of the Pasteur Institute, Paris, calls the experiment “an exceptional technical feat.”  But he told Science “many controls are missing.”          And that has prevented Dr Venter’s team, as acknowledged by Ham Smith, from truly understanding how the introduced DNA reprograms the host cell.          There will be some unease about how this effort is being driven by Dr Venter, who provokes strong emotions in those who know him.          He enraged the scientific establishment when his private venture competed with a Government backed international consortium to read the entire genetic code.           Many senior figures doubted that he could do it, and attacked him in public, but he succeeded with a rough draft in 2000 and probably helped science, and the world, benefit from this knowledge years earlier than they would have done.           He went on to sequence his own genetic code, then to find an amazing trove of new genes in the oceans, work that will change our picture of the marine environment.          Today’s announcement is a key part of the ultimate  expression of his scientific swagger: his efforts have now moved from reading DNA to writing it.          He has been trying to create a synthetic genome and, thanks to today’s work, now  has the means to use it to reprogram a bacterium.          For his effort to create artificial life, he first read the relatively small genome of a microbe found in human genitalia to an unprecedented degree of accuracy.          His team has since been trying to rebuild it in the laboratory, including a few DNA markers and other genes to show that this bug is their own work, the first living species designed by man.          Just as Mary Shelley’s Dr Frankenstein used bits and pieces to make a monster, Dr Venter hopes to salvage genetic components from a real bug to construct his artificial bugs.          “Shelley would have loved this,” he remarked at a press conference some years ago.           And, indeed, it is hard to think of a more remarkable reminder of how far science has come since the days of vitalism, where life was thought to be animated by a “vital spark,” “energy” or “élan vital,” which some equated with a soul.             To use these components to create the synthetic genome, his team has been making snippets of DNA, known as oligonucleotides or ``oligos”, up to 100 letters of DNA.           To build a primitive bug with around 500 genes in half a million letters of DNA, they have been stitching myriad tiny blocks of 50 or so letters into fewer small pieces, then growing them in the gut bug E coli, then turning these many small pieces into a handful of bigger ones - cassettes of genes - until he eventually gets two pieces which can finally be assembled into the circular genome of the new lifeform.          There are still many unknowns.          Journalists have often asked if the creation of artificial life is a step too far, whether Dr Venter and his team are ‘playing God’. (‘We don’t play,’ Ham Smith likes to joke.)           But Dr Venter has given the ethical fears serious thought, already having had a team of ethical and religious experts ponder the implications of a made-to-order organism.          The committee, led by Mildred Cho at Stanford University, had no objections to the work, but pointed out that scientists must take responsibility for any impact their new organisms had if they got out of the lab.          And, as with any new application of science, there are worries about how this work could be abused, for instance in bioweapons.          A few days ago, it emerged that Dr Venter’s team is applying for worldwide patents on methods to create “Mycoplasma laboratorium” .          The final step must now be close. ‘We will throw the soup together, give it a lightning bolt and see if we can start forming cells that have the machinery for self-replication,” he told me last year when I visited his laboratory in Rockville.          At that moment, he will hold his breath and see whether one or more microbes among the 100,000 million in a test tube ‘boots up’ with a strand of his synthetic DNA and starts metabolising and multiplying, according to his version of life’s recipe.            The Canadian ETC Group, which tracks developments in biotechnology, believes that this development in synthetic biology is more significant than the cloning of Dolly the sheep a decade ago, which is still sending out aftershocks in stem cell research.          “For the first time, God has competition,” said Pat Mooney of ETC Group. Indeed, given that today’s paper in Science gives a snapshot of Dr Venter’s work some time ago in his lab, he may have already created Genesis in a test tube.          Prof Brian Spratt, Imperial College, London said yesterday: “I think most people who know Craig believes he will make a synthetic bacterium, and I suspect he may well have already done it.”"
telegraph,7/11/2006 0:01,news,"            A squirt of 'scrounger virus' up the nose could soon see off the deadliest strains of bird flu, says Roger Highfield                                             Watch Professor Dimmock's computer animation of how the protecting virus works                               Sometimes a scientific idea is decades ahead of its time. Thirty years ago, researchers became intrigued by the discovery of what they thought was the Achilles' heel of all viral infections, from Aids to influenza. It seemed to herald that elusive cure for the common cold – actually a vast collection of viruses that inhabit the airways.          The average virus is no more than a clever chemical, a scrap of genetic material wrapped in protein that can help smuggle genes into a cell and pirate its molecular machinery to reproduce. But when they studied what happened during viral infections, scientists made a remarkable discovery that revealed a weakness in this parasitic life cycle.          When viruses multiply, most make faulty genetic codes – genomes – that miss out a critical piece of programming. These faulty viruses interfere with the replication of the normal virus. There is plenty of evidence of the effects of 'protecting viruses', notably in plant diseases caused by agents with arcane names such as turnip crinkle virus and broad bean mottle virus.          The best theory is that the protecting genomes act as a brake to prevent the normal virus killing the host, though the mechanisms are still not fully understood. Mathematical biologists have suggested these viruses are the equivalent of scroungers, cheats and frauds, that thrive by exploiting the hard work (in the form of proteins) of their normal peers.          Whatever the mechanism, scientists hoped decades ago to turbocharge this response as a way of defeating viral infections. But their efforts ran out of steam when overblown predictions failed to materialise. Now, however, the idea has been revived after animal tests have shown that this approach can provide instant protection against flu symptoms by slowing the development of an infection to such an extent that the body has time to build up immunity against influenza.          A squirt of a protecting virus up the nose would defend against any kind of influenza – such as the one that killed 50 million people in 1918. Such is the promise of the approach that its chief proponent in Britain says it is ready for testing on patients.          The work, by Prof Nigel Dimmock at the University of Warwick, provides an alternative to traditional vaccination methods, which depend on stimulating the immune system so that white blood cells produce antibodies that attach to the surface of the virus and start to kill it. This works well for diseases such as smallpox, polio and measles but is less effective with influenza, as the genetic code of the flu virus – written in 13,600 letters of the genetic chemical RNA, rather than DNA – is continually changing, presenting a moving target for vaccines.          Vaccination against one subtype of flu, such as H3N2, is ineffective against another, such as H5N1, the sometimes deadly bird flu circulating in the Far East. Indeed, when research on seasonal flu vaccines is scrutinised there is surprisingly little evidence they are effective, according to a study in the British Medical Journal.          In the past few days a hitherto unknown – and lethal – strain of H5N1 was reported by a team led by Prof Yi Guan of the University of Hong Kong. This has underlined fears that a mutant or hybrid virus could emerge that is able to spread between humans and for which existing vaccines would offer scant protection.          Enter the new form of protection based on reviving the old idea of a protecting virus. As Prof Dimmock explains, 'Through mistakes in replication, all viruses make versions of their genomes that carry huge deletions. At the same time these small, defective genomes become able to interfere in cells with the replication of normal virus RNAs. We thus call these interfering or protecting RNAs.'          The genetic material of a flu virus consists of eight segments of the genetic material RNA. Like normal viral RNA, the protective types – which contain as few as 400 letters of genetic code – are packaged in proteins that enable them to invade cells. They go to the same parts of the body – lungs and respiratory tract – as the virus. But interfering RNAs can only multiply with the help of a normal version of the infectious virus.          Replication takes place when there is an excess of infectious genomes over interfering genomes, while interference occurs when interfering genomes exceed infectious genomes. Eventually, interfering genomes make the major species of RNA as, being smaller, more of this RNA is made. 'As a result, interfering RNA has the potential to protect us,' says Prof Dimmock. 'But while these properties can be easily shown in cell culture, there are few examples of such therapy in the scientific literature.'          A big step has come with scientists' realisation that, while nature produces a cocktail of interfering RNA, the best effect is gained by using viruses with one type. This can be done by cloning RNA in the lab, or by selecting a virus that happens to contain a single dominant interfering RNA. 'The latter has given us our most active protecting virus,' he says.          Prof Dimmock's naturally occurring protecting virus lacks 80 per cent of one part of the viral genetic code. This makes the virus harmless and stops it reproducing by itself, so it cannot spread like a normal influenza virus. However, if it is joined in the cell by another influenza virus, it can exploit the latter's proteins to reproduce – at a faster rate than the new virus.          The invading influenza is therefore crowded out by the protecting virus. This vastly slows the progress of the new infection, prevents symptoms and gives the body time to build an immune response to the harmful invader. In this way the protecting virus converts the virulent virus into a live vaccine, blurring the distinction between an antiviral drug and a vaccine.          Research indicates that the protecting virus would only act against influenza A viruses, not common colds or other respiratory viruses. But it would not need to be tailored to a particular strain or mutation of influenza virus. 'Because it acts on the replication process, the protecting RNA should be active against any strain of type A influenza – past, present or future,' says Prof Dimmock.          This has obvious benefits in the face of a sudden epidemic, as one would not need to know the make-up of the new strain before deploying the protecting virus. Vaccines, which are effective only against particular known strains of virus, would take months to mass-produce from the moment a new strain of disease emerges.          In addition, the protecting virus – a natural by-product of infection – protects instantly, whereas defences built by conventional flu vaccination can take three weeks to be fully effective. Tests on animals show that a single dose of protecting virus can be given six weeks before an infection and still work. This could represent a major advantage over antiviral drugs, which give less than 24 hours' protection. And although drug resistance is a problem with many microbes, influenza virus does not appear to become resistant to protecting virus.          'Protecting virus also protects when given up to 24 hours after infection – and possibly longer,' says Prof Dimmock. 'It can counter an infection, and could be used to treat, say, the family of infected individuals.'          The Warwick research team has  a patent on the protecting virus and hopes to take the treatment through human clinical trials via a company the university has set up, ViraBiotech. Prof John Oxford, a virologist at Queen Mary's School of Medicine, London, said: 'This is cutting-edge, but it has a long way to go. To have something that guarantees coverage against anything this virus throws at us would be spot on. I'm amazed none of us have picked this up before, as it has been right in front of our eyes.'"

British scientists have applied for permission to create embryos that are part-human, part-animal.          Two teams of researchers yesterday submitted applications to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to carry out experiments in which human cells will be fused with rabbit, cow and goat eggs.                                        They want to create early-stage 'chimeric' embryos that would be 99.9 per cent human and 0.1 per cent animal in order to produce embryonic stem cells — the body's basic building blocks that can grow into all other types of cells.          Opponents called the plans 'abhorrent' yesterday and claimed that scientists were undermining 'the whole distinction between animals and humans'.          Chinese scientists have previously shown it is possible to harvest stem cells from embryos created by fusing human cells with rabbit or cow eggs. If licences to remove the nuclei from animal eggs, replace them with human cells and then grow stem cells are granted, the resulting embryos would be destroyed at 14 days — when they are no bigger than a pinhead.          Until now therapeutic cloning has been carried out using human eggs from consenting IVF patients, but these are in short supply.          Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, of the National Institute for Medical Research, said: 'This is a very rational step: to learn what you can using animal eggs, which are readily obtainable, before moving on to valuable human eggs when or if this becomes necessary.'          Dr Stephen Minger's group at King's College, London, want to use the cloned hybrid embryos to create embryonic stem cells carrying the defects responsible for conditions such as spinal muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.          Dr Minger said: 'We are concerned that the current state of the technology means that hundreds of eggs from young women will be required to generate a single human embryonic stem cell line. Therefore we consider it more appropriate to use non-human eggs from livestock as a surrogate to generate these disease-specific cell lines until the efficiency of this procedure is improved.'          The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 makes it illegal to mix human and animal eggs and sperm.          But there is an established exception in the so-called 'hamster test', by which fertility doctors test the quality of human sperm by fertilising a hamster egg and then destroying it no later than the two-cell stage.          The HFEA is known to have consulted lawyers on whether it has the power to approve yesterday's applications.          Their legal advice was that it did fall within their remit because the vast majority of the tissue involved would be human. But opponents will point out that, however small, the quantity of non-human material involved should mean that it falls outside their powers.          Dr Minger said that when it came to implanting human cells into animal eggs there was a 'regulatory void'. He added: 'Part of the reason we are doing this is to get some sort of clarification.'          Dr Lyle Armstrong and five colleagues at the North East England Stem Cell Institute in Newcastle want to insert human skin cells into cow eggs to study how eggs can reprogramme adult tissues into more primitive cells.          Their eventual aim is to develop a way of creating stem cells that could be used to grow new tissue — such as liver, heart and muscle cells — that genetically matches individual patients. This could then be transplanted without the risk of it being rejected by the immune system.          Josephine Quintavalle, the director of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: 'This is abhorrent. It sounds like the craziest kind of science imaginable.          'There is a basic human feeling that animals and humans do not mix in these areas. I think the public will be very upset by this because it makes people feel uncomfortable.'          Calum MacKellar, from the Scottish Council on Human Bioethics, said: 'In the history of humankind, animals and human species have been separated.          'In this kind of procedure you are mixing at a very intimate level animal eggs and human chromosomes, and you may begin to undermine the whole distinction between animals and humans.'          The HFEA, which would undertake regular audits of the laboratory work, is expected to reach decisions on the licence applications in around three months. But critics believe it will find in favour because, they claim, the regulator is trying to push the boundaries of reproductive medicine."
telegraph,16/09/2008 00:02,news,"            Britain's best young science writers pick the research vital to our future                   The hoopla that greeted the start-up of the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva has reignited public interest in science. But despite the atom-smasher's titanic scale - a collaboration between 10,000 scientists and engineers from 100 countries, at a cost of £4.4 billion - it is not the only colossal science project of recent years, and perhaps not even the most exciting one.          To celebrate the launch of the LHC, part of the Cern laboratory, and to mark the fact that a former winner of the Bayer/Daily Telegraph Young Science Writer competition, Professor Jonathan Butterworth, of University College London, is in charge of the British team working on its vast Atlas detector - we asked our latest generation of young science writers to name the recent research and new discoveries they think will do the most to change our understanding of the world.                                                      Full coverage of the Large Hadron Collider atom smasher                                                                        Hackers infiltrate Large Hadron Collider systems and mock IT security                                                                        UK to pull out of atom smasher project                                                         Miracle materials and the molecular bomb                               Sergei Palmer                  The experiments at Cern could change physics, but it will be chemists who will be at the forefront of solving the world's problems.          Research into nanotechnology and its applications could have a huge impact, while graphene, which consists of a sheet of carbon only a single atom in thickness, could be used to make lightweight, paper-thin aircraft parts or super-tough bullet-proof vests. Another technology of interest is the idea of using a type of acid to break down CFCs, in which the acid, which contains a form of silicon, acts as a 'molecular bomb'.                     Understanding the universe                              Matthew Wright                  There hasn't been any advance in fundamental physics for more than 30 years, but the LHC may finally give some answers. At the moment, we've got many theories about how the universe works - the Higgs boson, dark matter, dark energy, extra dimensions, string theory - yet they aren't backed up by experimental evidence. When we have the data from the LHC, the experts will finally be able to see if they are on the right lines. So there will be huge advances over the next 20 years - in fact, we are pretty much guaranteed to discover something new about the universe.                     'Junk' DNA and regenerative medicine                              Rebecca Robey                  The sequencing of the human genome in 2000 was a fantastic achievement, but the really exciting bit has come in the years since, with the explosion in genomics - the study of the entire genome. We have moved on to make direct comparisons between our genome and those of chimpanzees, and to track the variation between individuals.          In addition, the so-called 'junk' or 'non-coding' DNA that lies outside our genes has proved to play a vital role in controlling how genes are turned on and off, and in the development of diseases such as cancer.          Then there is adult cell reprogramming - the conversion of one type of adult cell into another. It's a long way off, but this may lead to the advent of regenerative medicine, the ability to replace cells that are damaged through accident or disease. This would help with a fantastic range of disorders, including Alzheimer's, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and even paralysis.                     The fight against climate change                              Rebecca Nesbit                  Scientists working on climate get a lot of bad press, but we need to give them much more credit. Our understanding of how human activity is modifying our climate has increased significantly in recent years - and how we respond to that knowledge will determine the future of our economy, environment and ultimately our species.          Climate change technology undeniably comes with risks and uncertainties, but I am excited by carbon sequestration techniques as a way of reducing warming - the problem will come if governments use its promise as an excuse to continue with business as usual.                     Small-scale surprises                              William Torgerson                  I have always had a passion for the science of the very small - indeed, the most important scientific advance of recent years has been the change in how we understand the structure of matter. I'm amazed by all the bizarre theories surrounding the LHC and what it will find - the existence of other dimensions, particles that can be in two places at once and the fact that the universe is packed with dark matter and dark energy.          Hopefully, by peering more deeply into sub-atomic structures, we will come to understand some of these ideas better.                     The genius of genes                              Katrina Megget                  I first got interested in science when I was about 15 or 16, and there was a big fiasco in New Zealand about genetically modified foods - putting frog genes in tomatoes and so on. Despite that backlash, and the ethical issues involved, stem cell research and genetic engineering could have so many benefits: cures for individual diseases, personalised medicine, even an end to poverty and over-population.                     The future is nano                              Arron Rodrigues                  The LHC is tremendously important, but on a more earthly level, I think nanotechnology has the potential to change many industries fundamentally - if any of the emerging technologies in the field proves successful and viable, the impact will be phenomenal. For example, nanotechnology could provide a replacement for the silicon we use in computer chips, which would reshape computing.                     Food and fuel for the world                              Teresa Livermore                  GM is a hotly debated and often controversial area, but one with massive potential in terms of economic and human benefits. We need to make progress in assessing the safety of GM plants and changing opinions among the general public.          If we are going to continue using biofuels, which take up much of the area that could be devoted to food crops, it will become ever more important to maximise agricultural productivity if we want to avoid sky-high food prices.                     Clean energy                               Simon Harold                  Everyone is concerned about climate change, but rather than being pessimistic, we should look at the advances that could result in terms of energy generation and carbon reduction. For example, the potential for nuclear fusion to produce clean, efficient energy is really exciting. If this can be harnessed and distributed worldwide, it could solve the world's energy crisis.                     Uncovering the nature of existence                              Samantha Carter                  I'm going to have to be predictable and say that the experiments at the LHC are the ones that really interest me, because nobody knows what is going to be found. Whatever happens, the results will change the face of physics forever, and give an insight into the very nature of existence, and other questions that people have been asking since the beginning of time.                     Genetics and organ transplantation                              Harriet Weller                  I'm still amazed by our discovery earlier in the decade that there are actually only about 25,000 genes in the human genome; a large discrepancy from the predicted 100,000 or more. This is an astonishing finding, considering the huge diversity there is between each human on the planet, and lays the foundation for many studies that could prevent genetic diseases.          At the moment, I'm especially excited by developments in organ transplantation. Will it soon be possible to produce a limitless number of organs, purely for transplantation, which will eliminate the need for human donors?                     Towards a 'theory of everything'                              Rory Reihill                  I'm more interested in the philosophical implications of science than in studying science itself - it's amazing to think about how our universe is so finely tuned to allow the existence of life. Even though I'm not all that attracted to the maths involved, it's also an exciting prospect to think about a unified theory of physics, and beyond that a 'theory of everything'. I hope that the LHC is able to push the standard model of how we understand the universe to the limits - after all, the physicists need the work!                     Stem cells and robot doctors                              Sophie McGlade                  The 21st century will be such an exciting time to be a doctor, with advances in nanotechnology and genetic engineering promising to transform the way that healthcare is administered. We'll not only be able to heal tissue damaged by heart attacks using stem cells, or offer new treatments for diseases such as cancer and diabetes, but the technology of medicine will change, too - for example by using robots to carry out surgery, increasing the precision and safety of operations.         • For full details of the writing competition, see www.science-writer.co.uk         "
telegraph,17/07/2005 00:01,finance,"            ReNeuron is returning to the stock market just two years after being taken private.  Sylvia Pfeifer examines whether investors should back the biotech company                  Investors in biotechnology companies are used to backing high-risk science that may never turn into a marketable product. Now a tiny company in Guildford, Surrey, is asking them to place an especially risky bet, but one with the potential for huge rewards.          The 20-strong company, ReNeu-ron, is working at the cutting-edge of medical science: stem cell research. Stem cells have the ability to grow into skin, bone, brain and other cells found in the body. Scientists are excited because they offer the potential to cure patients with little hope of other treatments, such as those who are paralysed or who have a debilitating disease such as Parkinson's.          Scientists believe stem cells could one day replace damaged cells and rebuild tissues to help restore a patient's health. For investors, the potential financial reward is enormous, but so is the risk.          Nobody knows this better than ReNeuron, whose scientists are working on treatments for brain damage caused by strokes and Alzheimer's disease.          Last week the company an-nounced plans to float on the Alternative Investment Market. It is looking to raise £10m to fund its first human trials in stroke patients. Including any money raised, the business could be valued at up to £30m.          If ReNeuron pulls it off, it will be the second time that the company has been listed on the stock market. It initially floated in November 2000 with a valuation of £65m.          However, the shares collapsed after the company discovered that its manufacturing process created unstable stem cells that divided too often and became impossible to control.           Its private equity backer, Merlin Biosciences, run by Sir Christopher Evans, eventually took it private for just £3.6m in April 2003 - less than the £5m to £6m cash ReNeuron still had on its balance sheet.          At the time, the collapse in ReNeuron's share price was viewed by investors as yet another salutary lesson of the dangers of investing in exciting but high-risk science.          Two years later, some of that scepticism remains. It will be at least six months before ReNeuron's first product begins human trials, making the company one of the youngest and most risky biotech businesses to try to float in London since the boom of 2000.          'I'm a big fan of stem cells but as a business, stem cell science is still too far away from reality,' a leading industry analyst commented.           So how confident should investors be about ReNeuron's prospects this time round? And is Merlin just looking to make a hefty profit?          Not at all, says Michael Hunt, ReNeuron's chief executive. 'Merlin are not making off like bandits,' he said. 'They have always backed this company to the hilt.'          'The company has changed in the past two and a half years,' according to Evans. He admits that ReNeuron considered changing its name in a bid to draw a line under its past problems, but in the end decided to stick with it.          'It's just being bold and honest and saying this is ReNeuron,' says Evans. 'We're back because we've got it right this time.'          Since going private the company has managed to stabilise its stem cell process and has developed and licensed technology that halts cell growth before implantation in humans.          'I am hoping that people will look at it and judge it for what it is now and not go harping on about the past,' Evans says. 'It was a research company then. Now it's a clinical company and it's got four projects all within short order in the next two years in the clinic.'          Evans rejects suggestions that the company is not worth the £15m to £20m pre-new-money valuation. ReNeuron has so far received £30m to fund its development, including about £14m from Merlin. The private equity company has not sold shares in ReNeuron and cash on the balance sheet at the time it was taken private has been reinvested.           Hunt is quick to stress that investors will not have to wait too long to see the company create true value.          'We are in a position now where we believe we can offer exciting value in the relatively short-term,' he says. 'We are very clear over what we can achieve in the next two to three years.'          He hopes the company will be ready to file for approval to start clinical trials in human stroke patients in the first half of next year. If everything goes to plan ReNeuron could license its lead product to a big pharmaceutical group within four years.           Whether investors are willing to back ReNeuron one more time will become clearer over the next two weeks as Hunt and his colleagues start marketing the float.          The company has been trying to raise funds from the US for the past six months. Evans warns that this is the last chance for UK institutions to ensure that ReNeuron does not quit Britain for the US, where investor appetite appears to be much greater. The country's three listed stem cell companies are each valued at more than $300m despite making heavy losses.          'We are coming to crunch time,' Evans says. 'If we don't float in London then we will go to America immediately after the summer.'"
telegraph,21/08/2007 02:10,news,"            Roger Highfield introduces the winners of our 20th annual hunt for young writers able to inspire a fascination for the wonders of science                                                               Video: why we need to get people excited about science                                                                        Video: Sir David Attenborough and the judges give their verdicts                                              How didgeridoos can snuff out snoring, the link between obesity and viral infections and why wasps have a streak of spitefulness; these are just three of subjects tackled in the vast range of articles submitted to the nation's most prestigious science writing competition, the winning entries of which are printed here.         The latest mission to find future popularisers of science, engineering and technology was launched with an article by Boris Johnson, the Telegraph columnist and shadow minister for higher education.          He emphasised the need to keep a grip on the way science was changing society and asked for entries that showed 'powerful thinking, but expressed so clearly that even people like me can understand it'.         His appeal to Britain's 16-to 28-year-olds ('Come on, folks. This is the nation of Newton and Boyle, and Faraday and Davy!') to compete for the chance to see their name in print and win thousands of pounds worth of prizes led more than half a million people to visit the competition's website,                www.science-writer.co.uk            .         I selected a third of the 350 entries that I thought were good enough to be considered for this page and sent them in batches to pairs of judges. They sorted out the best in terms of style, novelty and difficulty in popularising the subject - while watching out for poor grammar, jargon and plagiarism.         Finally, we all gathered at the Royal Society in London. There was much good-humoured debate about the merits of an unusually long shortlist - from whether a photo used by one entrant really showed a chortling chimpanzee ('almost certainly not,' said Sir David Attenborough) to why wobbles in stars reveal there is a planet tugging upon them. As the video summary of the judging shows, the overall standard was excellent.         Sir David summed up the panel's feelings when he said it was 'a delight to see the range of imagination at work to make all kinds of arcane subjects digestible'. The Daily Telegraph, Bayer and the Royal Society offer their warm thanks to the judges and to the hundreds of people who entered.                     The verdicts                              20-28 year olds: This category was tough to judge. 'I was really impressed,' said Jeremy Webb, editor of New Scientist. 'All the elements of science writing you would expect from a professional show up.' The first round of votes were split between five entries - Colin Barras, Stephen Smith, Hannah Devlin, and those from Blair Steel and Ed Yong, with Ed providing two entries good enough for final judging. After a show of hands, Colin was pushed into second place by Ed Yong, 25, who won £1,000.                     16-19 year olds: This category was not as strong as previous years, with physics, mathematics and technology unrepresented. But our winner, Matthew Jones, 16, from Grange School in Cheshire, who wrote on efforts to grow replacement teeth in the lab, stood out immediately for his neat blend of style and information on stem cell research. Laura McGuinness impressed with her account of scarless healing in a strain of mice, as did Joanne Marlor, who described the remarkable work on epigenetics, the effects of turning genes on and off, rather than mutations in genes. Second place was won by Joanne, also a Grange School pupil.                     Schools prize: Grange school in Cheshire had the highest number of finalists, winning it the special Bayer Award of £500. Once again, Andy Milne, the head of biology, won the Teacher's Prize, a £200 book token. He said: 'The willingness of Grange School students to pursue academic challenge outside of the classroom has impressed me hugely. It is testament to their perseverance, ingenuity and self-motivation that we have attained these results; I am one proud teacher.'

The grammatical rules that govern our languages have now inspired scientists to create a powerful line of synthetic proteins that could give us an edge over deadly drug-resistant bacteria.           At first glance, languages and proteins could not be more different. The former is the stuff of human minds and the latter are responsible for building those minds in the first place.          But, on closer inspection, they share uncanny similarities. Genes and proteins have their own parallels of letters, words, sentences and even grammar. Proteins are built from chains of molecules called amino acids, in the same way that sentences are chains of words.          But random strings of words are pointless. To form sentences and carry meaning, they must be united in specific ways defined by a set of rules – a grammar.          A protein's amino acids must be connected using similar 'grammatical' rules.          Their order determines the protein's shape and function, and haphazard combinations would result in molecular gibberish. For years, popular science writers have used this linguistic metaphor to help people appreciate and understand the genetic world.          But Christopher Loose and colleagues from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, near Boston, have used it in a more practical way – to design new medicines.           Loose focused on a group of small proteins called anti-microbial peptides, or AmPs. AmPs are normally deployed by the immune system to destroy bacteria and other infectious invaders and they have tremendous potential as cures for bacterial diseases.          Unlike conventional antibiotics such as penicillin, they don't seem to trigger resistance in their targets, and they conveniently give the rest of the host's immune system a boost.  As a group, AmPs carry out similar functions and individual members have many amino acid sequences in common.          For example, nine in every 10 insect AmPs, known as cecropins, contain the sequence QxEAGxLxKxxK, where each capital letter represents a specific amino acid and each small x can be filled by any of them.          Loose likened these shared sequences to common phrases in a language. He identified over 700 such 'phrases' that commonly occur in more than 500 well-known AmPs, Each one describes a sequence of 10 amino acids, and together these rules make up the grammar of an 'AmP language'.          In a spark of creativity, Loose realised that he could use this language to design all-new AmPs that might outperform their natural counterparts.          He designed a set of synthetic 'gramatically correct' AmPs, each just 20 amino acids long. In each of these designs, every set of 10 consecutive amino acids matched at least one of the 700 phrases.          He excluded any designs that were too similar to a naturally occurring AmP, leaving behind 40 promising candidates.          These were synthesised in the lab and tested against living bacteria.  Amazingly, they worked.          Eighteen of the synthetic AmPs blocked the growth of common species of bacteria and Loose picked the two best ones, snappily named D28 and D51, for further development.          Both successfully killed a bacterium called Bacillus cereus, at the same sorts of concentrations as natural AmPs.          Bacillus cereus causes mild food poisoning, but belongs to a bacterial group that includes Bacillus anthracis, the bug that causes anthrax, and Staphylococcus aureus, the basis of the drug-resistant MRSA strain.          Low concentrations of D28 and D51 stopped both bugs from growing.  Deploying naturally occurring AmPs against bacteria is risky; if the bugs then developed resistance, it could put public health in serious jeopardy. But synthetic proteins only bear passing resemblance to our natural arsenal.          If their targets developed resistance, it wouldn't compromise our own defences.  The study proves that language-based models can help scientists to design new medicines. This method could give us a multitude of new weapons against bacterial infections, greatly reducing the chances of resistance.          With an enemy that evolves so quickly, this is an invaluable advantage.                        Growing human teeth in the lab             By Matthew Jones Matthew Jones is from Grange School, Cheshire          In today's society, where capitalism runs rampant, you can't just be smart; you have to look the part.          So you've got the haircut and the shoes, you've done the diets and got the body to prove it, and you've got the clothes.          Everything looks good – you've had plastic surgery to make sure that it does –and then you smile. Too much red wine, too much social smoking and too much good food at those high-powered business parties have taken their toll and your teeth are a mess.          But, as they say, money solves everything. Recently, cosmetic dentistry has been one of the most rapidly growing markets.          Alistair Kennedy, a dentist at Gaskall Avenue Dental Practice in Knutsford, said: 'The market is growing almost exponentially. It's a huge area of growth, in an already multimillion-pound industry'.          He said: 'Prices start at around £60 for a tooth?whitening process, but can reach £20,000 or more for major changes, such as the implantation of titanium slugs as substitute teeth.'          An alternative to the metal slug procedure may soon become commercially available, due to pioneering research into the field of stem cells by Professor Paul Sharpe, of King's College London.           His research explores the possibility of producing new teeth that can be grown in the lab or even inside the mouth as a replacement for lost, damaged or discoloured teeth. Say goodbye to your malignant mouthful and hello to those perfect pearly whites.          Such an idea would have been outlandish even 15 years ago – a testament to how far biotechnology has come.           The research uses a property of stem cells – that they are pluripotent, or able to develop into any cell type in the species from which they were taken, given the right chemical stimuli.  Prof Sharpe's team has been primarily working with mice and their stem cells in order to prove that the principle of growing a biologically engineered tooth is sound.          This is one of four theoretical ways to produce a 'BioTooth' – the others are: to reconstruct the mature tooth as it appears in the mouth; to induce a third dentition, or natural tooth growth; to create a biological 'scaffold' and attempt to culture the tooth layers on this foundation.          However, the stem cell method seems to be the most successful, and the techniques could pave the way for more vital organ replication.           Prof Sharpe's team is working to reproduce the conditions found when teeth are first produced by the body.          They are trying to grow new teeth in a tooth bed, a specialised collection of tissues in which teeth develop.           This is done by implanting a pellet of stem cell-derived mesenchymal cells – the cells that produce the soft tissues – before coating this in epithelial tissue from the mouth, again stem cell-derived, and implanting it into a region of plentiful blood supply in an animal host, such as the kidney, and allowing it to develop for 25 to 30 days.          The professor said culturing such cells in the lab was the most difficult part, especially because of the lack of diverse, healthy stem cell lines from human sources.          However, his team has grown a human tooth in a mouse entirely from cultured cells. The teeth were of an appropriate size, surrounded by new bone and connective tissue, and showed evidence of root formation.          However, all this occurred in stable, controlled environments with few stresses.          Prof Sharpe wanted to see if the same would occur in the mouth, and so tooth beds were implanted into the mouths of mice.          After three weeks, despite the more demanding environment, teeth were easily identifiable in the region and they had oriented and affixed themselves.  "
telegraph,11/3/2004 0:01,news,"            Scientists believe they have     discovered a new way to defy the menopause which raises the     prospect of extending childbearing years and offers a more     natural alternative to HRT, writes Roger Highfield, Science     Editor                  Scientists have discovered a new way to defy the     menopause which could change women's lives, they     announce today.            Their research raises the prospect of extending     childbearing years and offers a more natural alternative to     HRT to offset ageing and maintain youthful vigour.             The discovery that women may make eggs after     birth, rather than be born with all the eggs they would     ever have, could provide profound insights into the timing     of the menopause.             It is also likely to help to improve the success     of grafts of ovary tissue to restore fertility in women     after chemotherapy for cancer.             The study overturns a theory of female fertility     that has persisted for more than half a century and     discloses that ovaries may have hidden reserves, a find     with 'significant clinical implications'.             The work, published in the journal Nature, was     carried out at Massachusetts general hospital, Boston.             Dr Marian Damewood, the president of the American     Society for Reproductive Medicine, said it 'could be     the most significant advance in reproductive medicine since     the advent of IVF more than 25 years ago'.             That depends on whether the research is confirmed     and a way is found to tap this new-found reserve of female     fertility.             Every textbook on reproductive science indicates     that women are born with their lifetime's complement     of eggs which are steadily lost until the supply is     exhausted, leading to menopause.             But the textbooks may have to be rewritten. The     study suggests that women continue to produce eggs after     birth from special stem cells, which have been overlooked     until now.             The eggs derived from these cells also form new     follicles, where eggs ripen, which drive the production of     hormones. The project's leading author, Prof Jonathan     Tilly, said yesterday: 'These are basic biological     findings that may change everything in our field. Although     there is no way to say how long it may take for these     findings to actually affect the care of patients, we are     very excited.'             However, the study was done on mice and a leading     figure in the field, Prof Roger Gosden, was cautious.             He welcomed the research, but said:     'Reproductive biology is very variable between species     and, as yet, there is no evidence in humans contrary to the     old dogma that egg production ceases before birth.             'If we have been wrong, I will be     astounded.'             If today's findings hold in humans, 'all     theories about the ageing of the female reproductive system     will have to be revisited,' said Prof Tilly. The study     raises the issue of whether such things as smoking,     chemotherapy and radiation could harm these stem cells and     prematurely age the ovary, he said.             Now the cells have been identified, ways to delay     ovarian ageing - and extend fertility - can be studied.               Removing, storing and reimplanting these stem     cells could offer an alternative to storing mature eggs,     which is difficult, for fertility preservation in cancer     patients.             The same approach could be used to delay the     menopause. 'That is something we are very excited     about,' said Prof Tilley.             The work also suggests that therapeutic cloning -     where stem cells are derived from an early cloned embryo -     could make eggs for infertile women, though Prof Tilly said     this was difficult to achieve.             The team made the find by uncovering a     'dramatic inconsistency' in the numbers of dying     eggs and the reserve of eggs in juvenile and adult     life.             Treating prepubertal female mice with a chemical     known to kill stem cells caused ovarian failure by a     mechanism that did not involve destruction of eggs present     at the start of the treatment.             Examination of ovaries of young and mature mice     identified cells on the organs' outer surface that     resembled cells which are the source of eggs in foetal     animals - now recognised as stem cells.             The team showed that new egg cells develop and     form follicles in ovarian tissue in genetically altered     mice.             If the work applies to women, it may explain why     fertility declines after 30: that this might be due to     depletion of stem cells, rather than exhaustion of an egg     reserve laid down before birth.             The team is trying to isolate and store the stem     cells in mice so they can investigate how to prevent     ovarian failure and infertility caused by ageing or cancer     treatments, with a view to applying this research to     women.             Charlotte Woodhouse went through the menopause at     the age of 14 and pins her hopes of raising a family on a     breakthrough in research.             For the past few years the thought of a scientific     advance that could help delay or even reverse the menopause     has brought comfort to the 23-year-old, who lives in Biggin     Hill, Kent.             In her case, the new understanding of stem cells     would have to be combined with therapeutic cloning, a     contentious method under development that is more hope than     real substance.             No matter how experimental, she hopes the work can     help all women in her predicament. 'It would not     bother me being a guinea pig,' she said.

telegraph,22/12/2006 00:01,news,"            Stem cells could one day be extracted from milk teeth and used forfuture repair, reports Roger Highfield                  Stem cells extracted from teeth left by children for the tooth fairycould one day be stored and used to build new teeth in case of damageand decay.          Stem cells are the subject of research worldwide because they have thepotential to develop into a wide range of other cell types to carry outrepairs of a body damaged by disease or injury.          Now a multi-national research team has successfully regenerated toothroot and supporting ligaments in tests on pigs that it says mark abreakthrough that 'holds significant promise for clinical application inhuman patients.'          The study headed by the University of Southern California School ofDentistry researcher Dr Songtao Shi  appears  in the inaugural issue ofthe journal PLoS ONE.          Using  human stem cells harvested from the extracted wisdom teeth of18- to 20-year olds, Dr Shi in Los Angeles and colleagues in China havecreated sufficient root and ligament structure to support a crown inpigs The resulting tooth restoration closely resembled the originaltooth in terms of function and strength.          The technique relies on stem cells harvested from the root apicalpapilla, which is responsible for the development of a tooth's root andperiodontal ligament, the connecting ligament between a tooth and itsbony socket.          Previous studies conducted by Drs Shi and collaborator Stan Gronthos atthe National Institutes of Health had used dental pulp stem cells butthe team  found the new technique to be superior.          'The apical papilla provides better stem cells for root structureregeneration. With this technique, the strength of the tooth restorationis not quite as strong as the original tooth, but we believe it issufficient to withstand normal wear and tear,' says Dr Shi.          He hopes to move the technique to human clinical trials within the nextseveral years, a potential boon for dental patients who are notappropriate candidates for dental implant therapy or would prefer livingtissue derived from their own teeth. 'Implant patients must havesufficient bone in the jaw to support the implant. For those who don't,this therapy would be a great alternative,' says Dr Shi.          The stem cells can be isolated from extracted wisdom teeth and bankedfor future use. But, according to Dr Shi, the not-so-distant future maybe one in which not only wisdom teeth, but those baby teeth once left tothe tooth fairy for a pittance, will become valuable to patients anddentists alike.           'We will be able to provide not only this technique, but other newtherapies utilizing a patient's own stem cells harvested from theirpreserved teeth. This is a very exciting discovery and one that I hopeto see in wide-spread clinical use in the near future,' says Dr Shi."
telegraph,29/09/2010 11:55,news,"A doctor who charged vulnerable multiple sclerosis patients thousands of pounds for ''pointless'' and ''unjustifiable'' stem cell treatments was struck off today by the General Medical Council.Robert Trossel, 56, was told his actions had done ''lasting harm'' after a   long-running GMC disciplinary hearing into his involvement with nine MS   patients who sought his help in ''desperation'' to find a cure for the   disease. Brian Gomes da Costa, chairman of the GMC fitness to practise panel, told Dr   Trossel: ''You have exploited vulnerable patients and their families. ''You have given false hope and made unsubstantiated and exaggerated claims to   patients suffering from degenerative and devastating illnesses. ''Your conduct has unquestionably done lasting harm, if not physically, then   mentally and financially, to these patients and also to their families and   supporters.'' Prof Gomes da Costa told Dr Trossel that his misconduct was 'fundamentally   incompatible' with being a doctor. 'You have repeatedly demonstrated deep-seated attitudinal problems and a   propensity for misleading conduct which is unlikely to be remediable,' he   said. Dr Trossel, who admitted he was 'too enthusiastic' about the use of stem cell   therapy, was found by the panel to have exploited vulnerable patients by   offering them 'unjustifiable' and 'inappropriate' treatments. Five were injected between August 2004 and August 2006 at his Rotterdam clinic   with a substance said to contain stem cells, in a move described as   medically unjustifiable, 'inappropriate' and exploitative of vulnerable   patients. Two of the patients, along with another MS patient, were advised by Dr Trossel   to undergo a treatment called Aqua Tilis therapy (AQT)- described by one as   'completely bizarre' - involving 'antioxidant steam' with 'magnetic fields   made from generators'. There was 'scant', if any, prospect of alleviation of the MS symptoms by stem   cell therapy and AQT, the GMC ruled. Dr Trossel exaggerated the benefits of stem cell treatment, did not describe   accurately how the stem cells would work and overstated his success in   treating patients with MS, the panel said. The GMC heard that he had no background in neurology or haematology and that   he was not an expert in stem cell research. He was also found to have used   stem cells that were not designed for human use. Earlier this month the panel ruled his actions constituted 'repeated and   serious' breaches of many of the 'essential tenets' of good medical practice   and that his fitness to practise was impaired. But it ruled that he was not dishonest because he believed the claims he had   made about stem cell therapy and AQT. The patients, the majority of whom were suffering from the 'progressive and   aggressive' form of the disabling neurological disease, raised thousands of   pounds to fund the therapy, in many cases through donations or sponsored   events. He was found to have injected four patients with material containing bovine   brain and spinal cord live cells without obtaining informed consent. Dr Trossel said he only discovered a batch of vials - sent to him in 2006 by   Advanced Cell Therapeutics (ACT) - were not designed for human use when he   took part in a BBC Newsnight programme. After contacting California-based All Cells and failing to get confirmation   the cells could be used on humans, Dr Trossel told the hearing he stopped   using the ACT products. From that point, he said patients were only treated with cells bought from a   supplier in Pakistan which provided necessary certification for human use. ACT's bosses, Laura Brown and Steve van Rooyen, underwent investigation by US   authorities and were facing extradition proceedings from South Africa, the   panel heard. As well as his Preventief Medisch Centrum clinic in Rotterdam, Dr Trossel had   consulting rooms in Wimpole Street, central London. He was described by his QC, Robert Jay, at the hearing earlier this week as a   'compassionate' doctor who continues to be a 'successful and sought-after'   practitioner in Rotterdam. He said Dr Trossel was 'neither driven by love of money nor love of self' and   had made it clear to patients that stem cell treatment was an experimental   and untested therapy. The patients involved in the case were named as James McCorrisken, Malcolm   Pear, Stephen Murphy, Rebecca Parker, Tracy Wagstaff, Karen Galley and   Deborah Sandford. Allegations against Dr Trossel in relation to two more patients - Catherine   Neal and Anita Knowles - were found not proved. "
telegraph,15/01/2007 00:01,news,"A flock of designer hens, genetically modified with human genes to lay eggs capable of producing drugs that fight cancer and other life-threatening diseases, has been created by British scientists.          Researchers at the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, which created pioneering GM animal 'drug factories' such as Tracy the sheep as well as Dolly the clone, have bred a 500-strong flock of ISA Browns. These are a prolific egg laying French cross between Rhode Island Red and Rhode Island White chickens.          Because they make proteins used as drugs in the whites of their eggs, they offer the prospect of mass-producing at a fraction of the price drugs that cost thousands of pounds a year per patient. This marks an important advance in the use of farm animals for the production of pharmaceuticals.             Existing methods for producing protein drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies used to treat cancer and arthritis, are expensive and time-consuming.             Using GM — 'transgenic' — farm animals for the mass production of such drugs is potentially cheaper, faster, and more efficient than standard methods, but researchers so far have been unable to make 'pharming' workable.          The GM chickens are reported today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Dr Helen Sang and colleagues in the Roslin Institute and the companies Oxford Biomedica, which specialises in gene therapy, and Viragen, which is commercialising the technology.          They describe how they have produced transgenic hens by using a particular virus — an equine infectious anemia lentivirus — to insert the genes for desired pharmaceutical proteins into the hen's gene for ovalbumin. This is a protein that makes up 54 per cent of egg whites, around 2.2 grams for each egg — a massive amount by the standards of biotechnology.          They inserted the human genes into chicken embryonic stem cells, then blended those cells with those of a normal chicken embryo to create a chimera, a blend of GM and normal cells.          Crucially, the cells in the oviduct (which lays eggs) consisted of GM cells and so passed on the implanted gene so the egg could make the drug protein.          The working proteins in these hens included miR24, a monoclonal antibody with potential for treating malignant melanoma, and human interferon b-1a, an antiviral drug.          Just as important, the genes were passed on to the next generation.          Although there have been attempts to make protein drugs in the milk of sheep, goats, cattle and rabbits, the team believes that the conversion of chickens into 'bioreactors' offers many advantages.

'We have bred five generations of chickens so far and they all keep producing high concentrations of pharmaceuticals.'

telegraph,26/10/2008 20:35,news,"A leading British adult stem cell scientist has announced he plans to quit the UK for France because he has not been given enough funding or support.  Colin McGuckin, professor of regenerative medicine at Newcastle University and an expert in adult stem cells, claimed that the Government and funding bodies are biased towards embryonic stem cell research, even his work has more immediate clinical benefits. He claimed his university has failed to provide him with adequate facilities, adding: 'You would barely know that adult stem cells exist at Newcastle.'Professor McGuckin, a Catholic, pioneered the extraction of stem cells from babies' umbilical cord blood in 2005 for the creation of skin and liver tissue. The method generates similar material to embryonic stem cells but is less controversial because no embryo is destroyed in the process. Prof McGuckin said it could yield livers for transplant within a decade. After a series of public warnings of a need for more funding, he has now decided to move to the University of Lyon in January to open the world's biggest institute devoted to cord blood and adult stem-cell research. He will take a 10-man research team from Newcastle with him, including his research partner Nico Forraz. Speaking to Times Higher Education, Prof McGuckin said France offered a 'much better environment' to cure and treat more people. 'The bottom line is my vocation is to work with patients and help patients and unfortunately I can't do that in the UK,' he said. 'France is very supportive of adult stem cells because they know that these are the things that are in the clinic right now and will be more likely in the clinic. 'A vast amount of money in the UK from the Government has gone into embryonic stem-cell research with not one patient having being treated, to the detriment of (research into) adult stem cells, which has been severely underfunded.'Stem cell ethics groups said his departure would create a 'huge hole' in Newcastle's research portfolio and another leading scientist, Anthony Hollander, a professor of tissue engineering at the University of Bristol, agreed funding was unbalanced. But the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust said they funded the best proposals across all areas and Chris Day, pro vice-chancellor for medical sciences faculty at Newcastle insisted it was improving facilities for academics.

But that method, pioneered in Japan, required a virus to genetically alter adult cells, such as skin cells, to convert them into embryo-like cells and there were safety concerns.          Now a team led by Prof Konrad Hochedlinger at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Centre and Harvard Stem Cell Institute has developed a safer approach.          His team's work, published in Science, deals with one of the major drawbacks of the technique developed by Japanese researcher Prof Shinya Yamanaka to reprogram cells.          Prof Yamanaka used a so called retrovirus - one from the same family as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus - to introduce four genes into, say, skin cells to turn back the clock, so they became more embryo like.          However, there are safety worries because a virus usually parachutes the new genes into the genetic code and this can cause damage or disruption, potentially triggering cancer.          'There is already evidence that one in five mice generated with such induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) develops cancer,' says Prof Hochedlinger.          Now Prof Hochedlinger and his team say that they have developed a method for generating these cells using a type of common cold virus, called an adenovirus, that does not knit the new genes into the genetic code, or genome.          This new finding represents a major step forward in the future use of the cells in the hospital and clinic, though it is less efficient.          Prof Hochedlinger, Dr Matthias Stadtfeld and colleagues grew their stem cells, which show potential for growing into a variety of other specialised cells including lung, brain, and heart cells, and they say that they have not observed any unwanted side effects yet.          In the past, similar reprogrammed cells have been shown to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and sickle cell anaemia in mice, so this new discovery could lead to advances in cell therapy and treatments of human disease as well.          However, the researchers say that it will be important to determine if human cells generated in the future using this kind of virus are as potent as human embryonic stem cells for potential clinical applications.          'It remains unclear how long it will take until 'safer' iPS cells can be used to treat patients.          Our work rather provided a conceptual advance showing that IPS cells in general can be produced without permanent genetic alterations of the genome, a pre-requisite for any therapeutic application of this technology,' said Prof Hochedlinger."

It is the first time cloned human embryos has been produced from adult cells, and raises the prospect that further embryos could be used to provide stem cells tailored to any patient.         Although the embryos only lived for five days, the breakthrough is seen as an important step towards new treatments for incurable diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.         In 2005 Prof Woo Suk Hwang at Seoul National University in South Korea claimed to have produced human embryonic stem cells, the research was later shown to be fraudulent.         The only confirmed cloned human embryo was created by a team at Newcastle University, however this was made by cloning human embryonic stem cells that are not routinely available from patients.         Dr Miodrag Stojkovic, a member of the Newcastle team and co-editor of the journal Stem Cells, which published the research yesterday, said: 'These researchers have for the first time developed cloned embryos up to blastocyst [five-day-old embryo] stage using adult cells as donor cells.         'This is a key advance in the development of patient-specific stem cell lines for therapeutic and drug development purposes.         'Although these results are preliminary since no stem cell lines have been derived from the cloned embryos, this may now be attempted.'         The researchers from the Stemagen Corporation based in La Jolla, California, used 29 eggs donated by three women in their early twenties.         Using a technique known as somatic cell nuclear transfer - involving hollowing out an egg and injecting it with the nucleus of a cell from a donor - they grew five early-stage embryos consisting of 40 and 72 cells. Three of these contained DNA from either Dr Wood or the other man who provided skin cells.         Asked whether it was true that Dr Wood was one of the men who gave skins cells to produce the clones, a spokesman for Stemagen, said: 'Yes, that is true. It stands to reason, we had to use somebody's skin cells and the review board said it should not be a patient who might be given false hope.'         Dr Stephen Minger, a stem cell expert at King's College London, said: 'This is academically interesting research that shows that another group have managed to create clone human embryos using nuclear transfer.         'Disappointingly the researchers did not go on to do the next step - to create embryonic stem cell lines from cloned embryos.         'The community is waiting to baited breath to see if anyone can do both steps together.'         However pro-life groups accused the scientists of reducing human embryos to nothing more than a factory of spare parts.         John Smeaton, of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, said: 'We have got scientists wandering around in an ethical wilderness, completely forgetting about matters of justice relating to our fellow human beings.'"
dailymail,14/07/2015 00:58,news,"A stem cell injection that could kill pain for more than a month has been tested by scientists.Many people suffering from chronic pain caused by the nerve damage of type 2 diabetes, surgical amputation, chemotherapy and other conditions find current painkillers have little or only short term effect.The breakthrough could provide advance cell-based therapies for chronic pain conditions, lower back pain and spinal cord injuries.The Duke University study found the stem cell therapy relieved neuropathic pain in mice caused by nerve damage.It used a type of stem cell known as bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), which are known to produce an array of healing factors and can be coaxed into forming most other types of cells in the body.These cells are already being tested in small-scale clinical studies of people with inflammatory bowel disease, heart damage and stroke.They have also shown promise for treating pain however it was not clear how they work.Mice treated with the bone marrow stromal cells were much less sensitive to painful stimuli after their nerve injury compared with the untreated mice.Professor Ru-Rong Ji in the Duke School of Medicine said: “This analgesic effect was amazing.“Normally, if you give an analgesic, you see pain relief for a few hours, at most a few days.“But with bone marrow stem cells, after a single injection we saw pain relief over four to five weeks.“Based on these new results, we have the know-how and we can further engineer and improve the cells to maximise their beneficial effects.”The study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation involved the delivery of the cells by a lumbar puncture, infusing them into the fluid that bathes the spinal cord.Pictures of the animals’ spinal cords showed that the injected stem cells had set up shop alongside the nerve cells in the spinal cord.To understand how the stem cells alleviated pain, levels of anti-inflammatory molecules that had been previously linked to pain were measured.One in particular, TGF-*1, was present in higher amounts in the spinal fluid of the stem cell-treated animals compared with the untreated animals.TGF-*1 is a protein that is typically secreted by immune cells and is common throughout the body.Previous studies has shown people with chronic pain have too little TGF-*1.In the new study, chemically neutralising TGF-*1 reversed the pain-killing benefit of the BMSCs, suggesting that the secretion of this protein was a major reason why the cells helped with pain.Injecting TGF-*1 directly into spinal cord fluid provides relief too, but only for a few hours.By contrast, bone marrow stromal cells stay on site for as much as three months after the infusion.This is the right length of time because if the stem cells stayed permanently there could be risk of them becoming cancerous.Importantly, BMSCs also migrate to the site of injury because a molecule emitted from the injured nerve cells called CXCL12 - previously linked to neuropathic pain - acts as a homing signal of sorts, attracting the stem cells.The next step will be to find a way to make the stromal cells more efficient.Prof Ji added: “If we know TGF-*1 is important, we can find a way to produce more of it.” "
telegraph,3/4/2011 9:00,news,"As Chinese researchers reveal they have created genetically modified cows that produce 'humanised' milk, we answer some of the key questions in the GM food debate. What is a genetically modified animal?Animals that have had genes artificially added or removed from their DNA are   described as genetically modified.How were the genes inserted into the cow genome?Artificial DNA, also known as recombinant DNA, was used to make genes with the   codes for human milk proteins. These was were then integrated into a   specially designed virus that was able to insert the artificial DNA into the   genome contained within cells from dairy cows. The new genetic material was   transferred into a cow egg using a process called Somatic Cell Nuclear   Transfer – the process used to clone Dolly the Sheep.Why create genetically modified cows?Scientists believe that it is possible to enhance the cattle in some way. In   the case of the Chinese research they wanted to make cows' milk more   nutritious by giving it the antimicrobial and immune boosting components   found in human breast milk. Generally genetic modifications to foods are   claimed to bring benefits such as disease resistance, increased yield,   drought resistance or greater nutritional value.Could genetically modified animals pose a risk to the environment?There are concerns that artificial genes in GM plants could pose a risk to the   environment if they were to pollinate other plants in the wild or other   non-GM crops. If this were to happen it would mean the artificial genes from   the GM plant would spread uncontrollably in wild plants and give them   whatever properties the gene conveys. In the case of genes causing crops to   produce pesticides or give them resistance to herbicides, it could damage   insect populations or allow weeds to grow uncontrollably. As most crops that   use GM technology are quite different from plants in the wild, the risk of   this transfer of genes is relatively low as it relies upon the ability of   the GM plants crossing with wild plants and producing viable offspring that   would survive. There is a theoretical risk that non-GM crops of the same   species could become contaminated though. In livestock, the risk of   artificial genes escaping from the GM population is even lower. The majority   of livestock breeding is now done using artificial insemination and is   carefully managed. Livestock animals have also been selectively bred for   thousands of years by humans and so are unable to interbreed with wild   species.Are there any risks to human health?GM foods are assessed on a case-by-case basis by the European Food Safety   Authority and other international food safety organisations. There are three   main issues that are debated as potential risks to human health. The first   is the risk of the genetically modified food provoking an allergic reaction   when eaten. Some proteins can trigger allergic reactions in people who are   sensitive to them and if genes that encode these allergenic proteins are   added to a food, it can trigger reactions. The transfer of genes from the GM   food to human cells or bacteria in the human gut is also a theoretical   concern. The probability of this happening is considered to be low by the   World Health Organisation. There is also a small risk that incorrectly   inserted genes could produce toxins were expressed in a food stuff, this   could also be harmful, but in most cases this would probably kill the GM   animal in the first place. Such incorrectly inserted genes would also be   picked up in the process that screens the cells before they are inserted   into an egg. Such food products would also never pass through food safety   assessments.Can it provide any benefits?Scientists say GM technology could bring benefits. By creating cattle or other   livestock that are resistant to disease, it could help to reduce the use of   veterinary drugs in the farming industry. Disease resistance could also help   to prevent devastating outbreaks that can threaten a country's entire   farming industry, like foot and mouth and bluetongue. Researchers in   Cambridge have been working on chickens that are resistant   to bird flu. Scientists have also been attempting to produce animals and   crops with greater ability to cope in drought conditions, a trait they say   could be essential as the climate warms. Introducing added nutrients and   vitamins to food products is also seen as being hugely beneficial in   developing countries where access to the varied diet enjoyed in the Western   world is harder to achieve. There is also the hope it can increase the yield   of foods by making animals produce more meat and milk, or allowing crops to   produce more food per acre.Will products from GM animals be sold in the UK?It depends on two factors - the regulatory authorities, and the customers.   Genetically modified crops and livestock are subject to control under   European regulation. Safety assessments on all GM foods are carried out by   the European Food Safety Authority before they can be marketed and sold in   Europe. These assessments include detailed studies of the potential for   toxic, nutritional and allergenic effects. The UK's Food Standard Agency   also carries out its own assessments through its independent scientific   Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes. More significantly,   consumer opposition to GM foods has meant that food producers and   supermarkets have adopted a cautious approach to using GM products. Without   appreciable consumer demand, there will be little desire among supermarkets   to stock such products."

Capita is everywhere but success makes it pricey         Capita Group                      519p+442p                        Questor says Hold                   By now Capita watchers should be accustomed to pleasant surprises from the company best known for collecting the congestion charge. But still the support services firm manages to beat expectations. Analysts were once again upgrading their numbers yesterday after Capita reported pre-tax profits had jumped 28pc in the first half.          As always, taxpayers have been the source of much of Capita's good fortune. Central and local government work accounts for nearly a third of the company's turnover, which rose 23pc to £845m. Nearly half the growth in turnover came from new contract wins including a 10-year, £132m deal to manage the BBC's human resources department, and a three-year, £120m deal with the Department of Trade and Industry.          Capita's pipeline is unlikely to dry up anytime soon, given Gordon Brown's commitment to slash costs by 20pc over the next five years. Capita reasons the Government will be unable to cut spending on frontline services any further, so all the efficiencies will have to come out of back office functions. Capita has a 15-year track record of reducing costs by a quarter when it takes over back office operations.           Meanwhile, after 18 months of stalling on outsourcing decisions, the private sector has started tendering again. Capita argues its biggest competitor is not another company, but inaction by the private sector. It is currently on the shortlist for 21 separate bids, both public and private sector, worth a total of £2.8bn. Capita is expected to post a full-year pre-tax profit of £199.3m, rising to £226.7m in 2007.           Capita's sparkling operational performance has been reflected in the share price, which has outperformed the market by 6pc this year. At 519p, it is trading around 21 times earnings to 2007, which is usual for the stock. But at these levels, investors could find better value in Serco, on 16 times earnings, until Capita's share price drops back.          Scott Wilson                      215p+54p                               Questor says Buy                   Scott Wilson. Sounds like an ageing Sixties pop star but actually was the ninth-largest British engineering consultant in 2005, and floated on the junior Alternative Investment Market in March this year. The company, led by chairman Geoff French, moved on to the market to sort out its long-term liabilities, as well as raising money to expand both here and abroad. To expand, it has £26m in cash reserves, and bank facilities of a further £35m, which is not bad for a company with a market value of £152m.          French sees much of the growth coming from new economies such as India, China and the rest of south-east Asia, and Scott Wilson already has a presence in most of the perceived key markets.           Closer to home, the focus is on growing the already-sizeable order book, with recent notable wins including a good chunk of the £200m the Government is spending on scoping out the Crossrail project for London. As French explains, even if Crossrail does not get the go-ahead, it doesn't matter, as the consultancy work is merely a precursor and not dependent on getting the green light.           Scott Wilson reported an in-line operating profit of £10.4m, producing profit before tax of £8.3m. Broker Brewin Dolphin is forecasting a 2007 profit of £14.1m, giving earnings per share of 12.9p next year, putting the company on a price-earnings ratio of 16.6 times. This looks slightly cheaper than rivals such as Mouchel Parkman and WSP Group, and with the shares on an upward trajectory, now could be the time to take a closer look.           Stem cell research                      Sector comment                   Could George Bush's veto of a US Bill that would have allowed federal funding for embryonic stem cell research create opportunities for the nascent companies in this field in the UK?          The disgruntlement among some US scientists would suggest the answer is yes. But while Mr Bush's move has closed off an opportunity for America to accelerate, the status quo has not changed.           Privately-funded research on embryonic stem cells can still be done in America and as the US's biotechnology industry has by far the deepest pockets in the world, there will be plenty of money to further development.          Yet Mr Bush's hostile position on stem cells in human embryos - the most controversial but useful sort of stem cells because of their versatility - can only help UK companies working in this area, including ReNeuron and Scotland's Stem Cell Sciences (SCS).          ReNeuron re-listed on Aim last summer after being taken private in 2003. SCS and Manchester-based Intercytex have also joined Aim.          Issues to be cautious about include the fact that therapies based on stem cells remain years in the future. In addition, the area is still a sensitive one for ethical reasons. But given the generally-accepted promise stem cells offer, some of these emerging companies are worth a long-term investment.                      james.quinn@telegraph.co.uk         "
telegraph,10/9/2013 8:48,news,"Britain’s rich can now freeze their stem cells for future use. Is it worth it, asks Michael Hanlon A future where the human race divides into two species – genetic haves and   have-nots – has been a trope of science fiction ever since HG Wells   populated the distant future with the childlike Eloi and the cannibalistic,   troglodyte Morlocks.More recently, the American biologist Lee Silver predicted, in his book   Remaking Eden, that future advances in genetics and cloning would allow the   rich of the 22nd century and beyond to produce “boutique babies” –   disease-resistant, genetically enhanced for strength, attractiveness and IQ,   and perhaps even unable to mate with the un-enhanced Untermensch majority.Speculation and sci-fi aside, the fact is that health and wealth have been   positively correlated for a long time. We in the rich world live longer,   healthier lives than those in poor countries thanks to our better diets,   medicines and sanitation.But in the past decade or so, scientific advances in genomics and stem-cell   therapies have promised – or threatened – a future much like that predicted   by Prof Silver and others, where the hyper-rich can buy their way out of   senescence (biological ageing) and live, if not forever, then into a hale   and healthy old age.Yesterday, it was announced that a French genomic technology company called   Cellectis is to launch a service in Britain whereby a sample of cells will   be taken from your skin,  turned into a special tissue called Induced   Pluripotent Stem (IPS) cells, with almost magical properties of   regeneration, and frozen. In the future, doctors will be able to take some   of these cells and use them to culture replacements, to exchange with those   damaged by the ravages of time.Because of its hefty price tag – the procedure costs £38,400 – the company   anticipates that only the rich will avail themselves of this service,   raising the prospect of a future world dominated by healthy-but-ancient rock   stars, hedge-funders and oligarchs.The basic science is sound. Stem cells can develop into any kind of tissue,   meaning that a patient suffering the early signs of Alzheimer’s could be   treated by an injection of their own healthy tissue to replace the damaged,   senile brain cells. It may even be possible to grow whole organs – hearts   and kidneys, say – derived from frozen IPS cells.So how solid is the science behind this? Or is it just another version of   cryonics, the process whereby American companies take huge sums of money to   freeze people’s bodies (or, for a lower price, just their heads) in the hope   that unspecified “medical advances” will be able to revive them.Certainly, Cellectis is a serious outfit, with heavyweight scientists on its   payroll. It will be utilising very recent breakthroughs in stem cell   research. Last year, a Japanese scientist, Prof Shinya Yamanaka, won the   Nobel Prize for medicine after he showed that it was possible to convert   adult, specialised cells (those that make up one kind of tissue) into   general-purpose (or “pluripotent”) stem cells by injecting just four genes –   called Klf4, Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc. In effect, these “Yamanaka factors” tell   the cell nucleus to “forget” that it is a bit of brain, skin or blood and to   reboot genetically, returning to the state it was in the embryo – capable of   becoming almost any kind of tissue.The process is extremely clever. The genes, identified by studying the stem   cells found naturally in embryonic tissue, are cultivated in bacteria, and   then transferred into retroviruses – agents similar to HIV, but disabled so   they cannot cause disease. These are then used to infect the adult cells,   and turn them back into stem cells.Previously, the best hope of obtaining stem cells was to harvest them from   embryos. However, this process is time-consuming and riddled with ethical   problems, not least that you have to create embryos in order to destroy   them. Many faiths, including the Catholic Church, oppose such research.Another stem-cell “insurance policy” is cord-blood banking, popular in the US,   whereby blood from the umbilical cord is extracted at birth and stored for   future use. Cord blood contains stem cells – but of a type that could only   treat a limited range of blood disorders.The real question is how wide the gap is between Prof Yamanaka’s Nobel-winning   breakthrough and a therapy that will change lives. According to Prof Wolf   Reik, a geneticist at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge, there are many   hurdles before IPS becomes a routine treatment.“While producing IPS cells is straightforward, there are real safety issues,”   he says. For a start, the genes from the virus remain in the cell, to   unknown effect. “You can carry out additional manipulations to excise the   viral DNA, but so far no one has made a completely clean cell.”It is also not clear how much of the “memory” of its differentiated state   remains in an IPS cell derived from the donor’s skin. Some studies have   shown that, in fact, these cells do not completely forget what tissue they   came from. Reprogramming cells to be able to turn into any tissue also   raises the risk of cancer. Overcoming this will take years of further   research.Scepticism aside, there is no doubt that stem cell treatments represent a   possible new dawn in medicine. In July, a pilot study in Japan was approved   in which IPS cells will be used to generate retinal cells to treat   volunteers suffering from age-related macular degeneration.If this is successful then, just perhaps, we could be seeing the dawn of   something very exciting. If you have got a spare £38,400, you may well feel   it’s a future worth investing in.  "
telegraph,22/09/2010 20:00,news,"Britain's world-leading position in stem cell research faces its own 'valley of death' if government cuts are too deep, claim leading scientists. Trailblazing researchers and their work will be forced to move abroad in order   to maintain their position at the forefront of this exciting and potentially   lucrative medical science, they said.That will mean that once again Britain pioneers a science only for the rest of   the world to cash in on it. The warning from a group of scientists including Sir Richard Sykes, the   biochemist and new chair of the Royal Institution, came on International   Stem Cell Day marking 25 years of the fledgling science. Sir Richard Sykes, who is also chairman of the UK Stem Cell Foundation, said   the UK's position was under 'threat'.  'The UK is without doubt a leader in stem cell research,' he said. 'We   need to translate and commercialise stem cell therapies, or scientists will   move away.  'I believe that the UK's position is under threat at the moment because   there is a funding gap which is currently filled elsewhere by private and   government funding.  'People call that the valley of death, and that's what it is.  'We are doing well but I think we have to be careful because we could   lose it.' Stem cells are immature cells from embryos, foetuses or adults that have the   ability to transform into different kinds of tissue. They hold out the promise of revolutionary regenerative treatments for a host   of conditions, including cancer, heart disease, blindness and liver disease   – as well as dementia and joint replacement. At present, Britain is a world leader and if it can turn research into   clinical treatments could build a multi-billion industry supplying stem   cells and services to the rest of the world. But the research is at a crossroads and faces enormous threats from America   and the Far East, both of which are investing billions in the research. Now with the government's austerity drive, the scientists are worried that it   could end our supremacy. Professor Chris Mason, an expert in regenerative medicine at University   College London, said the current funding was not enough to take the next   step.  'It is highly important to note that this fledgling industry represents   as big an opportunity to future UK health and wealth as biotech was in the   1970s,' he said.  'However, we must break with the mantra of 'invented here and   commercialised elsewhere'.  'This is a very big chance for us to deliver a stem cell therapies for   the benefit of NHS UK PLC and the benefit of patients.  'However as the sector matures there is a great risk that the UK will   lose momentum. The ability of the UK to benefit from our world class stance   rests with our politicians.  'The government must finish the job and provide the necessary   environment for the clinical commercialisation stage before our hard fought   lead is lost together with future health and wealth benefits for the UK.  'The rewards will be a multi-billion pound industry.' Professor Pete Coffey, of the London Project to Cure Blindness, at University   College London, who is working on a stem cell-based therapy for the eye   condition age-related macular degeneration, reckons a 10 per cent drop in   funding could spell disaster. He admitted that the investment levels in places such as California and   Singapore made them 'very attractive' but added: 'I'm loyal   to where I was born. I was educated here, I have family here, I don't see   why I should move out of the UK.' But if funding fell by a certain level, he feared having to make people   unemployed.  'The pressures are becoming huge,' he said. At the same meeting the government did announce some extra funding for stem   cell research. The exact amount of the cash boost unveiled by universities and science   minister David Willetts is subject to overall Government spending but   industry chiefs said it was expected to be around £10 million. It will be used from next March to fund competition by companies seeking to   bring new therapies to the marketplace. Mr Willetts said: 'We are a world leader. Stem cells do have enormous   potential, for health benefits, and contributing to our wealth and economic   growth. We are a world leader.  'It is an exciting area of scientific advance. Although money is tight   we are committed to this area of medicine.' "
telegraph,12/4/2008 7:11,news,"By Roger Highfield          Science Editor          A FLOCK of designer hens, genetically modified with human genes to lay eggs capable of producing drugs that fight cancer and other life-threatening diseases, has been created by British scientists.          Researchers at the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, which created pioneering GM animal 'drug factories' such as Tracy the sheep as well as Dolly the clone, have bred a 500-strong flock of ISA Browns. These are a prolific egg laying French cross between Rhode Island Red and Rhode Island White chickens.          Because they make proteins used as drugs in the whites of their eggs, they offer the prospect of mass-producing at a fraction of the price drugs that cost thousands of pounds a year per patient. This marks an important advance in the use of farm animals for the production of pharmaceuticals.          Existing methods for producing protein drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies used to treat cancer and arthritis, are expensive and time-consuming.          Using GM — 'transgenic' — farm animals for the mass production of such drugs is potentially cheaper, faster, and more efficient than standard methods, but researchers so far have been unable to make 'pharming' workable.          The GM chickens are reported today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Dr Helen Sang and colleagues in the Roslin Institute and the companies Oxford Biomedica, which specialises in gene therapy, and Viragen, which is commercialising the technology.          They describe how they have produced transgenic hens by using a particular virus — an equine infectious anemia lentivirus — to insert the genes for desired pharmaceutical proteins into the hen's gene for ovalbumin. This is a protein that makes up 54 per cent of egg whites, around 2.2 grams for each egg — a massive amount by the standards of biotechnology.          They inserted the human genes into chicken embryonic stem cells, then blended those cells with those of a normal chicken embryo to create a chimera, a blend of GM and normal cells.          Crucially, the cells in the oviduct (which lays eggs) consisted of GM cells and so passed on the implanted gene so the egg could make the drug protein.          The working proteins in these hens included miR24, a monoclonal antibody with potential for treating malignant melanoma, and human interferon b-1a, an antiviral drug.          Just as important, the genes were passed on to the next generation.          Although there have been attempts to make protein drugs in the milk of sheep, goats, cattle and rabbits, the team believes that the conversion of chickens into 'bioreactors' offers many advantages. They produce more quickly and are much cheaper to look after.          'This is potentially a very powerful new way to produce specialised drugs,' said Dr Karen Jervis of Viragen Scotland, which worked with the Roslin team.          'We have bred five generations of chickens so far and they all keep producing high concentrations of pharmaceuticals.'          Andrew Wood, of Oxford BioMedica, whose researchers collaborated on the project, said: 'This could lead to treatments for Parkinson's disease, diabetes and a range of cancers.'"

Both were suffering from advanced melanoma but the technique could be customised to attack other common cancers.         Although scientists remain cautious because there have been many false dawns in the use of gene therapy, the results show, in principle at least, that aggressive cancer can be treated this way, even after it has spread and the outlook is grim.         Mark Origer, 53, told The Daily Telegraph last night how, after five years of losing the battle with the disease, he was made well enough to attend his daughter's wedding last year.         'She wanted me to be there for her and she wanted me to be there for me,' he said.         Mr Origer was diagnosed with melanoma — the most aggressive form of skin cancer — in 1999.         A cyst which grew on the same area of his back in 2002 was found to have malignant cells and the cancer continued to spread until, in June 2004, it was found in his liver. He underwent various chemical and surgical treatments, but none was found to stop the spread of cancer.         In December 2004, he was given the gene therapy and was discharged the same month. By January 2005, his tumours had shrunk by half and by last September, when he attended his daughter Katie's wedding, one small spot remained in his liver which surgeons removed.         Last week, doctors pronounced him completely clear of cancer cells.         Of the 17 patients with advanced skin cancer who underwent gene therapy, the treatment worked only on Mr Origer and 'Thomas M', aged 39, clearing the disease from liver, lymph node and lung.         But scientists believe they can improve the response and adapt it to fight other cancers, notably breast, colon and lung.         The success using the patients' genetically modified white blood cells is reported today in the journal Science by a team at the US National Cancer Institute led by Dr Steven Rosenberg, a pioneer in the field.         He said: 'Both patients are still free of the disease, after 18 months.'         During the study tumours shrank in other participants, all of whom had exhausted other forms of treatment.         'It is the first time, with all the hype of gene therapy, we have managed to use genetic engineering to treat cancer patients,' Dr Rosenberg said.         Dr John Niederhuber, the institute director, said: 'These are very exciting successes. They bring hope that this type of gene therapy could be used in many types of common cancers and could be achievable in the near future.'         Prof Alan Kingsman, of Oxford BioMedica, a British company developing gene therapy and vaccines to fight cancer, said: 'This is an excellent piece of work and shows the huge therapeutic potential of immune therapy.'         The treatment relies on the body's protective immune system, in this case a type of white blood cell, or lymphocyte, called a T-cell. Although they attack tumours, these alone are no match for an aggressive cancer.         Dr Rosenberg created billions of T-cells by removing the patients' cells and modifying them so they developed a certain receptor, a protein that helps them to recognise and kill tumours.         Genetically engineered cells were transfused into 17 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, where the disease had spread.         The study shows that the engineered cells can shrink large tumours.         Dr Rosenberg has found a more potent class of receptors, up to 100 times more effective at helping immune cells attack the cancer. His team has also engineered immune cells to attack breast, lung and liver cancers.         'We have now expressed other lymphocyte receptors that recognise breast, lung, and other cancers,' he said. 'They are present on half of all common cancers.         'We can, with these powerful receptors, convert any patient's normal cells into cells that will recognise these common cancers.'         Trials will start within a month, subject to approval by the US authorities, though Dr Rosenberg did not want to identify which cancer types would be involved."
telegraph,14/11/2010 09:00,foodanddrink,"Chocolate capable of fighting heart disease and offering other major health benefits could be available within five years following work by scientists to unlock the genetic code of the cocoa tree. Researchers working with confectionary giant Mars are scouring the genome of   the tree Theobroma cacao to find ways of enhancing the health   benefits of cocoa beans produced by the plant.Scientists took two years to unlock the genetic code of the tree and now hope   to use the information it contains to improve the quality, flavour and   nutritional value of the beans, which are used to produce chocolate.They believe they can boost the levels of compounds known as flavonols in the   beans. Flavonols have been found in recent research to improve blood   pressure and have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. The researchers also hope to increase other health qualities that have been   attributed to chocolate such as increasing brain function and combating   diabetes, while also working to make the fat it contains healthier.Dr Howard-Yara Shapiro, who is global director of plant science and research   at Mars Incorporated, said: 'The idea is that this is something that   will become the norm – healthy fats, high levels of flavonols. 'Chocolate will become something quite different in 10-15-20 years and we are   on that track now.'Flavonols have been shown to be good for your heart in many trials. The   genome can help us enhance these molecules in cocoa plants. We believe we   can increase the quality of the cocoa fat to make it healthier. 'It is not as easy as it sounds but it is one of our key targets.'It is not something we can deliver tomorrow, but maybe in five years we   can. Having the genome will speed up the process because we will be able to   locate which genes are responsible for high levels of flavonols and help us   select for those plants.'Dr Shapiro, who is also a professor of environmental sciences at the   University of California, persuaded Mars to fund the $10 million project to   decode the genome, with the help of computer firm IBM, which analysed the   data, and the US Department of Agriculture.In a little over two years they were able to disentangle the 420 million units   of DNA that make up the plant and in an unusual move for a private company,   rather than patent the genome, they have now published   it online making it available for anyone to use for free.Dr Shapiro and his team are now searching the cocoa tree's 34,997 genes in the   attempt to select key traits that will improve the plants and the chocolate   that comes from them.Traditional breeding techniques can take years to produce trees with the   traits they want as thousands of plants must be bred together and then   breeders have to wait for the offspring to grow into adult trees before they   can see if they have the required physical traits.Mars initially intends to use natural breeding of the cocoa plants rather than   genetic engineering to produce new varieties of trees with boosted traits,   but armed with the genome, the process will be sped up massively.Scientists will be able to take DNA samples from the leaves of the offspring   while they are saplings to check if they have carried the genes they want.But Dr Shapiro added it was possible that some researchers could also use the   publicly available genome to create new plants using genetic engineering   techniques, but insisted that Mars intended to use traditional breeding   techniques.He said: “Rather than having to wait until those trees grow up over five years   or so to look at the physical traits of the trees, we can instead take the   DNA from the sapling once it sprouts and find out what traits it has. 'It speeds up that screening process hugely.“We are still going to have to breed millions of trees and evaluate every   single one, but we will very carefully and slowly add traits to the plants   that will be sent out to the farmers.“These traits will increase the yield of the plants, give them drought   resistance and disease resistance while also making the cocoa bean   healthier.”There are currently three million tonnes of cocoa produced every year, but the   crops are vulnerable to pests and disease, often causing hundreds of   millions of pounds worth of damage. The production of cocoa has also   resulted in large swathes of rainforest being destroyed.Scientific studies on the health benefits of currently available chocolate   have provided mixed results and last week the European Food Safety Authority   ruled that manufacturers should not be allowed to advertise these health   benefits due to the inconsistent evidence.Flavonols, which are credited with providing most of chocolate's health   benefits, are typically found in dark chocolate and are what helps to give   it the bitter taste. Research has shown they can decrease blood pressure and also increase the   function of the vascular system. They have also been linked to increasing blood flow to the brain, and have   been suggested as useful for helping treat stroke patients. There is also   some evidence that they can help reduce insulin resistance in diabetics.Scientists believe that the genome could help them to identify new flavonols   that have a less bitter taste and so their levels can be increased in   chocolate bars without making them unpalatable. They also hope it will lead to other discoveries about other nutrients in the   cocoa beans that could be boosted.Dr Baukje De Roos, from the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health at the   University of Aberdeen who has been studying the effect of chocolate on   cardiovascular health, said boosting the flavonol content of chocolate could   give people the health benefits without them having to eat large quantities   of the sweet, fatty foods which can be harmful.She said: “We only know the actions of a couple of hundred compounds in the   cocoa bean but there are thousands there. “The genome is a really good start, but hopefully in the future we might even   identify a lot more bioactive compounds from cocoa that could be beneficial   to human health.”"
telegraph,21/05/2010 03:21,news,"Craig Venter, the American biologist who has created artificial life in a laboratory for the first time, has defended himself against accusations he was ''playing God''.The creation of the ''synthetic cell'', described as a ''landmark'' by one   British expert, is a 15-year dream come true for maverick genetics   entrepreneur Dr Venter.He breathed life into a bacterium using genes assembled in the laboratory in a   development with major implications for genomics, including the manufacture   of artificial organisms designed for specific tasks such as making vaccines   or cleaning up pollution.But experts recognise that there are potential dangers too. Synthetic life   could, for instance, pave the way to biological weapons.Speaking from Washington on BBC2's Newsnight, Dr Venter dismissed suggestions   that he was ''playing God''.He said: ''That's a term that comes up every time there is a new medical or   scientific breakthrough associated with biology. It's been a goal of   humanity from the earlier stages to try and control nature.. that's how we   got domesticated animals.''This is the next stage in our understanding, it is a baby step in our   understanding of how life fundamentally works and maybe how we can get some   new handles on trying to control these microbial systems to benefit   humanity.''Asked if the technique could be bought by the highest bidder, he replied:   ''The technology is not for sale, the cells are not for sale. We are trying   to use this technology to advance vaccine protection, we are trying to use   it to advance the basic understanding of cellular life.''He also dismissed the danger of bio-terrorism, stating: ''Most people are in   agreement that there is a slight increase in the potential for harm but   there's an exponential increase in the potential benefit to society.''Dr Venter's researchers explain in the journal Science how they effectively   ''re-booted'' a simple microbe by transplanting into it a set of genetic   code sequences that were built from scratch.The genome was copied from the blueprint contained in Mycoplasma mycoides, a   simple bacterium that infects cattle and goats.After first constructing short strands of DNA, the scientists used yeast cells   as natural factory assembly lines.The sequence was built in a step-by-step process. DNA repair systems in the   yeast attached the pieces together, gradually lengthening the strands to   finish up with a chromosome more than a million ''letters'' of genetic code   long.The final test came when the completed chromosome was transplanted into   another bacterium, Mycoplasma capricolum, replacing its native DNA.After a failed first attempt, the scientists brought the cells to life. Driven   by the new genome, the bacteria took on the appearance and behaviour of M.   mycoides, generating different proteins and multiplying.Describing the achievement, Dr Venter said: ''This is the first synthetic cell   that's been made, and we call it synthetic because the cell is totally   derived from a synthetic chromosome.''This is an important step we think, both scientifically and philosophically.   It's certainly changed my views of the definitions of life and how life   works.''To prove the recipient bacteria contained the synthetic genome, the scientists   effectively signed their names in DNA.Four of the DNA sequences included coded ''watermarks'' - strings of   ''letters'' corresponding to the names of people involved in the project, an   e-mail address, and some famous quotations.Commenting on the breakthrough in Science, Professor Mark Bedau, editor of the   journal Artificial Life, called it ''a defining moment in the history of   biology and technology''.US biologist Dr Jef Boeke, from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,   Maryland, told the journal: ''It represents an important technical milestone   in the new field of synthetic genomics.''British expert Professor Paul Freemont, co-director of the EPSEC Centre for   Synthetic Biology at Imperial College London, said: ''The paper... is a   landmark study that represents a major advance in synthetic biology.''The applications of this enabling technology are enormous and one might   argue this is a key step in the industrialisation of synthetic biology   leading to a new era of biotechnology.''Dr Venter, who runs the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland, came   to fame when he controversially challenged publicly-funded scientists   working on the international Human Genome Project, the first attempt to   produce a complete map of the human genetic code.He set out to construct his own private version of the human genome, using a   different ''short cut'' method, and succeeded. The race ended in a dead heat   when both versions were published simultaneously in Science in 2001.Even before the human genome milestone, Dr Venter was working towards the   creation of synthetic life.The research published today marks the culmination of 15 years' effort at a   total cost of around £30 million.Dr Venter obtained ethical approval for the research before embarking on it.He insists the work is harmless, pointing out that the bacteria involved do   not infect people. However, a relative of M. mycoides, M. pneumonia, does   cause lung infections in humans.The watchdog group Human Genetics Alert called for a moratorium on ''synthetic   life'' research until there had been a full public debate and an effective   system of global regulation was in place.Director Dr David King said: ''What is really dangerous is these scientists   ambitions for total and unrestrained control over nature, which many people   describe as 'playing God'. The claim of authorship of nature goes   hand-in-hand with the claim to monopoly patent rights over it.''Scientists' understanding of biology falls far short of their technical   capabilities. We have already learnt to our cost the risks that gap brings,   for the environment, animal welfare and human health.''"
telegraph,27/08/2008 18:45,news,"Diabetes patients have been offered hope of a treatment that could free them from injections after scientists converted cells from the pancreas into insulin-producing cells.                                                       Scientists use 'biological alchemy' to convert one cell type into another                                                                        Stem cell technology may make blood donations thing of the past                                                                        Stem cell technique is 'significant advance'                                              In the quest for the next generation of treatments, scientists have spent the last decade working on human embryonic stem cells, parent cells which have the potential to turn into any of the 200 plus types in the body, for a vast range of treatments, from diabetes to Parkinson's disease.           Rather than use embryos, or obtain embryonic stem cells by the use of cloning or genetic modification, a new front has opened up in the field: the conversion of one cell type, say a skin cell, into another, say a brain cell or a pancreatic cell, by a kind of extreme makeover they call 'direct reprogramming.'           Pioneering work in Oxford University by Prof Tariq Enver showed it is possible, turning white blood cells into red cells, suggesting that biological alchemy is a possibility, sidestepping ethical concerns about the use of embryos.           Today in the journal Nature, Harvard Stem Cell Institute co-director Prof Doug Melton and Dr Qiao 'Joe' Zhou report having directly turned one type of fully formed adult cell into another, rare, type of adult cell that could have direct uses in treating diabetes.           Prof Melton, who began his diabetes research in 1993 when his infant son was diagnosed with the illness, says he is obsessed with trying to find a new treatment for Type 1 diabetes, in which beta cells are destroyed. 'I wake up every day thinking about how to make beta cells,' he said.           Now, by introducing genes into a cell with a virus, the team is able to turn mouse exocrine cells, which make up about 95 per cent of the pancreas, into precious and rare insulin-producing beta cells. These beta cells, which comprise about one per cent of the pancreas, are the cells that die off in Type I diabetes.           The team says this is a major step forward toward eventually developing a treatment for the adult Type II - and eventually Type I - diabetes, a treatment that might someday eliminate the need for patients to constantly monitor their blood sugar and take insulin-adjusting medications, or even insulin.           However, the team stresses that there are numerous hurdles that lay ahead before a treatment could be tested in humans.           Prof George Daley, immediate past president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research, where the results were recently previewed, says Prof Melton's findings 'will revolutionize what is already a revolutionary field.'           Unlike the process involved in creating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), which have caused enormous excitement ever since their introduction two years ago by Japanese researcher Prof Shinya Yamanaka, this direct reprogramming technique does not require turning adult cells into embryonic like cells and then figuring out how to induce them to differentiate into a desired cell type.           Prof Melton emphasises that his new work does not in any way eliminate the need for, or value of, work with iPS cells or human embryonic stem cells.         'We need to attack problems from multiple angles,' adding that his lab is using several approaches Prof Melton did his graduate work at Oxford University with Sir John Gurdon, who did pioneering work with the clawed frog to show the cells of an adult contained the recipe to make an individual half a century ago.           Sir John says: 'What you really want is a missing cell type, one that is not functioning properly to be derived from something else. But you only want that cell type. So I think this is a really important step forward in exercising what people really wanted and showing how well it can work.'           Prof Joan Brugge, Chair of the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School, says the study ' offers great potential therapeutically. Direct reprogramming represents a more straightforward strategy to treat diseases involving loss of function of specific cell populations than approaches requiring an intermediate embryonic stem cell.'           The team achieved the feat by hunting for special genes that control how the genetic code is interpreted by cells to turn them into brain, bone, heart cells or whatever. They found that just three so called transcription factor genes that seemed critical for beta cell development, called Ngn3, Pdx1, and MafA.           'We're intrigued by the possibility that this approach, which has worked for pancreatic insulin-producing cells, could be more widely applied to many kinds of cells, especially those that are lost in disease or following injury,' Prof Melton says."
telegraph,23/10/2010 21:00,news,"Europe's largest stem cell clinic which treats hundreds of British patients a year is at the centre of a scandal following the death of an 18-month-old baby who was given a controversial injection in the brain, it can be revealed. A doctor who worked at the clinic is now under criminal investigation over the   child's death in August and the serious injury caused to a second child in   another alleged botched operation three months earlier. The clinic has been accused of bungling the operations and failing to respond   quickly enough when the surgery went wrong. The XCell-Center, based in Düsseldorf, has attracted thousands of patients   with incurable illnesses from all over the world. The clinic claims its technique for stem cell transplantation has had success   in treating 17 different diseases including cerebral palsy, multiple   sclerosis, autism, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart disease, diabetes and   spinal cord injuries. Such stem cell treatments, which typically cost between £10,000 and £20,000,   are banned in the UK and most other European countries unless as part of a   clinical trial because there is still no scientific proof that they work. A Sunday Telegraph undercover reporter who suffers from multiple   sclerosis and is confined to a wheelchair was told last week during a   consultation at the XCell-Center that he could walk again. According to XCell, about 25 British patients a month – including children   with severe disabilities – are treated at its clinic in Düsseldorf and at   another in nearby Cologne. The treatment involves taking bone marrow from patients, harvesting stem cells   from the bone marrow and then reinjecting those stem cells into other parts   of the body, including the brain, the spine and the neck. But XCell is now under scrutiny following the death of a child in August, The   Sunday Telegraph can reveal. The 18-month-old boy, whose Romanian parents lived in Italy, was injected in   the brain with stem cells and subsequently died. In May a 10-year-old boy from Azerbaijan almost died when the same procedure   went wrong. His family is suing the clinic. Criminal prosecutors are investigating the death and the case of the other   child, who is now understood to be more severely disabled than when first   treated at the clinic. Dr Michael Sabel, chief neurosurgical consultant at the University Hospital   Düsseldorf, has accused XCell of failing to react quickly enough when the   10-year-old boy began to suffer internal bleeding in the brain. The child was brought to his hospital where he underwent life-saving emergency   surgery. Dr Sabel then wrote a letter to authorities warning them a child could die if   the procedure was repeated at the clinic. Three months later the Romanian boy died after being rushed to a hospital,   about a 15-mile drive from Düsseldorf. Dr Sabel is mystified why the child   wasn't brought to his hospital five minutes away. Dr Sabel told The Sunday Telegraph: 'What we had was an   unjustified surgical procedure with complications which was then not   properly dealt with. They had injected the stem cell into the brainstem,   which is the most delicate structure in the brain.' Dr Uta-Kristein Tamaschke, the doctor who injected the children and who had   pioneered the stem cell transplant into the brain, is no longer working at   the XCell-Center. Christoph Kumpa, the public prosecutor in the case, said: 'The inquiry as   far as I am concerned is directed towards this specific doctor and her   actions and not the firm.  'We are dealing with a mountain of medical paperwork at the moment.   Should it come to legal proceedings, they will not take place before the   summer of next year at the earliest.' He said XCell was co-operating   with his office. The Paul-Ehrlich Institute, which regulates medicines in Germany, produced a   report following the death which concluded that XCell's procedure for   injecting stem cells into the brain had been conducted with 'damaging   consequences'. It said the treatment was 'precarious' and that under German law   such 'precarious' treatments are illegal and should stop. The XCell-Center was sent a list of questions by The Sunday Telegraph   to respond to last week. In an email sent on Thursday, the clinic promised   to answer but had failed to do so by the time of going to press yesterday. Additional reporting: Allan Hall and Susanne   Kutter"
telegraph,4/6/2008 17:00,news,"Evidence that brain injections of stem cells could help to treat cerebral palsy and many other severe childhood neurological diseases is published today.                                                      Embryo-free stem cell research gets boost                                                                        Obitaury: Lorenzo Odone                                             Just last week, Lorenzo Odone, whose battle with one such disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, was featured in the film Lorenzo's Oil, died and there is no effective treatment for any of these conditions.         Now preparations are under way for human trials of stem cells, after a team found that they can dramatically improve the condition of mice with a neurological condition similar to these childhood diseases, many of which are fatal.         In the journal Cell Stem Cell, a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre, New York, reports how they injected approximately 300,000 human stem cells into the brain of each mouse, choosing five particular spots because of their ability to serve as 'launch pads' for stem cells to migrate and colonise the entire brain and spinal cord.         With a one-time injection of stem cells just after birth, the scientists were able to repair defective wiring throughout the brain and spinal cord - the entire central nervous system - of mutant 'shiverer mice,' so called because of the way they shake and wobble. The work marks an important step toward the day when stem cells become an option for the treatment of neurological diseases in people.         The team used a type of foetal human cell - glial stem cell - to treat a condition that normally claims their lives within about 20 weeks of birth, after a lifetime of seizures and other serious consequences.         While most of the 26 mice that received transplants still died, a group of six lived far beyond their usual lifespan, and four appeared to be completely cured - a first for shiverer mice. 'We kept expecting them to die. Not only did they not die, but they improved day by day,' says the head of the team, Prof Steven Goldman         The scientists plan to gather more evidence before trying the approach in sick children. 'It's extremely exciting to think about not only treating but actually curing a disease, particularly an awful disease that affects children,' says Prof Goldman.         'Unfortunately, right now, we can do little more for many of these conditions besides tell parents to prepare for their kids to die.'         Thousands of children with rare, fatal disorders known as pediatric leukodystrophies share a central problem with the shiverer mice: their brain cells lack sufficient myelin, a vital fatty coating that wraps around cells in the brain like insulation around an electrical wire.         Myelin loss is at the heart of multiple sclerosis, and also plays a role in the symptoms of diabetes, high blood pressure, and other diseases.         In children, diseases of myelin go by a host of names but share the same features: a childhood and young adulthood that may include weakness, difficulty standing or walking, seizures, dementia, paralysis, and ultimately, death.         These diseases, which include Tay-Sachs, Krabbe's, Canavan's, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher, Vanishing White Matter Disease adrenoleukodystrophy, and a host of others are each rare, but collectively they kill thousands of children every year.         'Our hope is to use this approach on infants with pediatric leukodystrophies and some forms of cerebral palsy, all of which are prototypic disorders of childhood myelination,' he says.         However, there is much more preparatory work to be done, he tells the Telegraph. 'Our time frame to clinical trials remains unclear though, since we need to first gain US Food and Drug Administration approval, which is itself contingent on the proper manufacture of the cells under appropriately regulated conditions- what's called GMP manufacture here - an expensive affair for which we've not yet identified sponsors.         'If there's a consolation, it's that preclinical work is now sufficiently compelling that I'd be relatively confident of an outcome that will justify the effort - which is to say provide real benefit - once we finally do get to trials'"
dailymail,1/6/2015 17:11,sciencetech,"Female members of a critically endangered species of sawfish are reproducing in the wild - without sex.The discovery marks the first time living offspring from 'virgin births' have been found in a normally sexually reproducing vertebrate in the wild, the researchers said.Earlier evidence that vertebrates might sometimes reproduce via the process called parthenogenesis had primarily come from isolated examples of captive animals - including birds, reptiles, and sharks. In those instances, the animals in question surprised their keepers by giving birth despite the fact that they'd had no opportunity to mate. In addition, researchers recently reported two free-living female snakes, each pregnant with a single parthenogen, but it was not known if these embryos would have lived in the wild. Therefore, it was unknown whether this phenomenon took place to any significant extent in wild populations.Demian Chapman of Stony Brook University in New York and his colleagues from the Priztker Laboratory at the Field Museum of Chicago and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission made the discovery that vertebrate parthenogens can and do live in the wild after conducting routine DNA fingerprinting of smalltooth sawfish in a Florida estuary.This analysis revealed around 3 per cent of the sawfish in their studies are products of an unusual form of reproduction. 'We were conducting routine DNA fingerprinting of the sawfish found in this area in order to see if relatives were often reproducing with relatives due to their small population size,' said lead author of the study, Andrew Fields, a PhD candidate at the Stony Brook University's School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.'What the DNA fingerprints told us was altogether more surprising: female sawfish are sometimes reproducing without even mating.'Parthenogenesis is common in invertebrates but rare in vertebrate animals, the researchers explained. Vertebrate parthenogenesis is thought to occur when an unfertilised egg absorbs a genetically identical sister cell. The resulting offspring have about half of the genetic diversity of their mothers and often die.'There was a general feeling that vertebrate parthenogenesis was a curiosity that didn't usually lead to viable offspring,' added Gregg Poulakis from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, who led field collections of the sawfish.And yet the seven parthenogens the researchers found appeared to be in perfect health. All of the animals were tagged and released back into the wild as part of an ongoing study of sawfish movements.'Occasional parthenogenesis may be much more routine in wild animal populations than we ever thought,' said Kevin Feldheim of the Pritzker Laboratory at the Field Museum of Chicago, where the DNA fingerprinting was conducted.It's possible this form of reproduction occurs mainly in small or dwindling populations. The researchers are now encouraging others to screen their DNA databases in search of other hidden instances of vertebrate parthenogens living in the wild.As for smalltooth sawfish, it's possible this ability could keep them going for a little longer. But it won't be enough to save them.'This should serve as a wake-up call that we need serious global efforts to save these animals,' Feldheim said.The findings are reported in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on 1 June. "

'She wanted me to be there for her and she wanted me to be there for me,' he said.          Mr Origer was diagnosed with melanoma — the most aggressive form of skin cancer — in 1999.          A cyst which grew on the same area of his back in 2002 was found to have malignant cells and the cancer continued to spread until, in June 2004, it was found in his liver. He underwent various chemical and surgical treatments, but none was found to stop the spread of cancer.          In December 2004, he was given the gene therapy and was discharged the same month. By January 2005, his tumours had shrunk by half and by last September, when he attended his daughter Katie's wedding, one small spot remained in his liver which surgeons removed.          Last week, doctors pronounced him completely clear of cancer cells.          Of the 17 patients with advanced skin cancer who underwent gene therapy, the treatment worked only on Mr Origer and 'Thomas M', aged 39, clearing the disease from liver, lymph node and lung.          But scientists believe they can improve the response and adapt it to fight other cancers, notably breast, colon and lung.          The success using the patients' genetically modified white blood cells is reported today in the journal Science by a team at the US National Cancer Institute led by Dr Steven Rosenberg, a pioneer in the field.          He said: 'Both patients are still free of the disease, after 18 months.'          During the study tumours shrank in other participants, all of whom had exhausted other forms of treatment.          'It is the first time, with all the hype of gene therapy, we have managed to use genetic engineering to treat cancer patients,' Dr Rosenberg said.          Dr John Niederhuber, the institute director, said: 'These are very exciting successes. They bring hope that this type of gene therapy could be used in many types of common cancers and could be achievable in the near future.'          Prof Alan Kingsman, of Oxford BioMedica, a British company developing gene therapy and vaccines to fight cancer, said: 'This is an excellent piece of work and shows the huge therapeutic potential of immune therapy.'          The treatment relies on the body's protective immune system, in this case a type of white blood cell, or lymphocyte, called a T-cell. Although they attack tumours, these alone are no match for an aggressive cancer.          Dr Rosenberg created billions of T-cells by removing the patients' cells and modifying them so they developed a certain receptor, a protein that helps them to recognise and kill tumours.          Genetically engineered cells were transfused into 17 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, where the disease had spread.          The study shows that the engineered cells can shrink large tumours.          Dr Rosenberg has found a more potent class of receptors, up to 100 times more effective at helping immune cells attack the cancer. His team has also engineered immune cells to attack breast, lung and liver cancers.          'We have now expressed other lymphocyte receptors that recognise breast, lung, and other cancers,' he said. 'They are present on half of all common cancers.          'We can, with these powerful receptors, convert any patient's normal cells into cells that will recognise these common cancers.'          Trials will start within a month, subject to approval by the US authorities, though Dr Rosenberg did not want to identify which cancer types would be involved."

telegraph,22/06/2007 00:01,news,"Heart attack victims are to be injected with stem cells from their own bone marrow in a groundbreaking trial that could improve patient survival rates.         Doctors hope the injections will repair the cell scarring caused during major heart attacks, and allow patients to enjoy an improved quality of life.         Dr Raimondo Ascione, the consultant cardiac surgeon leading the team from the Bristol Heart Institute, said: 'We have elected to use a very promising stem cell type selected from the patient's own bone marrow.         'This approach ensures no risk of rejection or infection. It also gets around the ethical issues that would result from use of stem cells from embryonic or foetal tissue.'         Britain has one of the worst heart attack rates in the world, with someone suffering an attack every two minutes.         Heart attacks are responsible for one in four deaths in men and one in six deaths in women.         An attack is caused when blood flow to a section of heart muscle becomes blocked. Cells in part of the heart die, leaving areas of scarring. These areas are less effective at pumping blood around the heart and body, which can lead to patients going on to develop heart failure.         Current techniques, such as coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty, can improve blood flow around the heart, reducing the risk of further attacks. But they cannot return the scarred tissue to its pre-heart attack condition.         The Bristol team's trial hopes to restore the damaged scar tissue, which has the potential to improve the survival rates and quality of life of heart attack victims.         Dr Ascione said: 'Around one in five heart attack victims will go on to develop heart failure. A number of these will die within two or three years and those remaining will have a very poor quality of life.         'If this trial is successful it could be a major breakthrough with major clinical implications. It could allow heart attack patients to have a good quality of life.'         Patients will be injected with stem cells from their bone marrow during a routine coronary bypass operation.         It is hoped that the stem cells will go on to reduce or repair the heart scarring, which will vastly improve the health of the heart.         Up to 60 recent heart attack victims will undergo this revolutionary technique from August. Under the trial some patients will be given a placebo injection rather than a stem cell injection, enabling doctors to prove conclusively if the stem cell treatment is effective.         Dr Ascione said: 'Current treatments aim to keep the patient alive with a heart that is working less efficiently than before the heart attack.         'Cardiac stem cell therapy aims to repair the damaged heart as it has the potential to replace the damaged tissue.'         Dr Ascione and the team from the Bristol Heart Institute have been awarded a grant of £210,000 from the British Heart Foundation to conduct the clinical trial.         Prof Jeremy Pearson, the Associate Medical Director of the British Heart Foundation, said: 'We hope that this exciting Bristol project will provide information taking us a step nearer to the day when stem cells can be used routinely to help repair damaged hearts.'"
telegraph,23/02/2014 06:30,news,"It is possible to work out the identities of anonymous people who participate in genetic-research studies by cross-referencing their data with publicly available information The genetic information of hundreds of thousands of Britons could be revealed   through ‘hacking’ into the DNA of their relatives who sign up for genome   projects, it has been warned.Scientists have shown that it is possible to work out the identities of   anonymous people who participate in genetic research studies by   cross-referencing their data with publicly available information.And they have found that the genetic data of their relatives can also be   inferred, even if they have never signed up for a study.It could mean that highly personal information, such as a person’s risk of   developing Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s or muscular dystrophy could be   discovered, even if they do not know it themselves.It could also lead to personal family histories being made public.In 2012, David Cameron announced that 100,000 people in England will have   their genome sequenced in the first stage of an ambitious public health   programme which the government hopes could revolutionise treatments.But there have been growing concerns that huge medical databases could be   hacked and data made public breaching privacy and even harming employability   and insurability. Earlier this week the roll-out of new NHS medical database care.data was   halted for six months after risk analysts said it could undermine patient   confidentiality.Yaniv Erlich, a geneticist and former hacker of MIT, discovered that it was   possible to find the surname of a person simply by looking at their genome   and comparing it with online genealogy databases whose participants were   identified.In western societies men usually pass down their surname to their sons, and so   rare variations in their Y chromosome – known as short tandem repeats - are   inherited and stay linked to their names.Erlich decided to test if it was possible to find a surname from an anonymous   genome after reading of how a 15-year-old boy, born from a sperm donor, had   managed to track down his real father using a genealogy database.He invented a piece of software called LobSTR which scours the genetic   sequences of anonymous genomes and generates a profile of short tandem   repeats which can then be compared with other databases.By cross-referencing these profiles with public ancestry databases he was able   to find the surname of the donor in 12 per cent of cases.And by working out the link between the genome donor and the identified   genealogy database donor he could build family trees.Erlich said it would be possible to determine if a close family member was   predisposed to a genetic disease by looking at the DNA of their relatives.“Genetic data of other family members can be identified even if these people   didn't contribute directly to genetic genealogy databases.“For example, finding a genome with two ApoE4 alleles reveals a 15 fold   increase in the risk of developing Alzheimer’s.“It doesn’t work all the time. The success rate is around 12 per cent. But if   you think about the ubiquitousness of genetic information, that is millions   of people, then you can get quite a large number of surnames.”Erlich carried out the experiment to prove that genetic databases are   vulnerable to hacking and that even if data is anonymised it is still   possible, by jigsaw identification, to find out personal details of   individual donors. Many ancestry databases give surnames, age and a rough location for a   participant and so a simple directory programme like 192.com could reveal a   street name.Erlich proved that he could find the name and home address of American   biologist Craig Venter – one of the first people to ever sequence his genome   – simply by running his genome through the lobSTR algorithm, comparing it   with a genealogy database, then running a simple address search. Although the study was carried out in the US, Erlich said that similar UK   databases were likely to show a similar result.“A significant number of the US surnames were derived from the UK population.   Therefore, I expect it could it is possible to use the US databases for UK   surname inference,” he added.However he does not believe his results should dissuade people from allowing   their genetic data to be used.“It’s good to do these processes to try and find breaches accurately and to   stop them before there is real catastrophe,” said Erlich.“We are entering the age of ubiquitous genetic information. The question is   how we should move forward how we should be able to collect genetic data   while protecting their privacy preferences.“We have a certain rhetoric saying we will anonymise your data but that is   quite a difficult promise to keep. We understate the risk of identification   but we overstate the risk of harm.“What I am trying to push is the idea that we need to have a more honest   conversation with people about the actually risks or harm.”Earlier this week NHS England agreed to the delay of the care.data database   following days locked in talks with The British Medical Association (BMA).The NHS has also agreed to launch a publicity campaign to explain the scheme   and ensure individuals are aware of their right to opt out.But Erlich claims there is also a danger in waiting.“There is a trade off. I don’t think we will ever be able to say we have   mapped all the vulnerabilities because technology is moving so fast,” he   said.“Genetic information is highly important for biomedcial research. We can't   deliver the promise of personalized medicine without processing such   information. However, we cannot fully guarantee privacy.“We need to communicate the benefits and the risks of genetic research to   participants in a transparent way, make sure to have enough safeguards   against harm and respect the participants' decision.”"
telegraph,19/05/2000 00:00,comment,"IT seems to me both sad and shocking that the Prince of Wales has used his considerable influence, in his Reith Lecture on sustainable development this week, to cast grave doubt upon science. He suggested that science is somehow at odds with nature; that 'scientific rationalists' are at odds with proper feeling and a sense of wonder at the world; in his call for a sense of the sacred, he even suggested that a purely secular approach is more or less bound to be environmentally irresponsible; in other words, the godless are unlikely to be green, and so are 'scientific rationalists'.He spoke of balance, but in effect he has set up a series of false dichotomies. It is bad enough that this kind of thinking represents a serious misunderstanding of what science truly is; worse still, it will support the Luddite tendencies of this country's highly professional environmental pressure groups, in their irrational and unscrupulous determination to prevent scientific developments that could do wonderful things - that already have done wonderful things - to feed the hungry, enrich the poor and protect our environment.That is precisely the opposite of what they say they want to achieve, of course, but they are opposed to reason and to scientific investigation; Prince Charles's Reith Lecture will only encourage them. They will also have been very encouraged by the news story of the day after Prince Charles's speech, that, as one headline put it, 'Rogue GM seeds taint UK crops'.The Ministry of Agriculture had to admit, after a highly questionable delay of about a month, that large quantities of genetically modified oilseed rape had been sown by mistake, both last year and this, in British farmland; unknowing farmers had been sold, by mistake, Canadian seed of which about one per cent was genetically modified. Of course, this added to the deep opposition in this country to anything to do with biotechnology, and a general New Age feeling that we must stick to what is 'natural' and 'organic'.It's a wholly understandable feeling, and very powerful. It is sometimes right, too, as with feeding carrion to cows, in the case of BSE. But it is very usually wrong - feelings are of no use in judging empirical evidence, or indeed without it. The public was disgusted by Jenner's experiments in the 18th century with cowpox, and his invention of vaccination seemed horribly unnatural. There were cartoons at the time of humans with lots of little cow's udders growing from their arms. Had public sentiment prevailed, smallpox would probably be still with us.Tinkering with nature, flying in the face of common sense, as science seems to do, can be very scary. But the truth is that tinkering with nature, and flying in the face of common sense, to put it in those emotive and misleading terms, are what has made the West rich, powerful and in a position to be compassionate to less developed countries. Tinkering with nature has freed the West from back-breaking peasant labour, famine, malnutrition and disease - all those evils from which mankind has begged the gods for deliverance. But deliverance came from science; scientists have been the great heroes and heroines of the modern era, and not least among them many great British scientists.Prince Charles's opposition to genetically modified crops is well known; he expressed it again very firmly in his Reith Lecture, arguing instead for traditional systems of agriculture; 'genetic manipulation [sic]' he said, 'seeks to transform a process of biological evolution into something altogether different'. What a pity it is that someone of his stature has not taken the opposite position. For the truth is that traditional or organic farming, however desirable it might be in some ways, cannot feed the world.What's more, genetic modification is, in fact, very much the same as evolution, but simply speeded up. Its risks are largely misunderstood, and usually wildly exaggerated. Its benefits could be dazzling. Many minds in this country and in the European Union generally are no longer open. In the United States, by contrast - home of extreme consumer caution and massive class-action lawsuits - a House Committee on Science sub-committee has very recently issued a report on the risks and benefits of GM plants, named Seeds of Opportunity.It concluded that there is no significant difference between GM plants and similar plants created using traditional cross-breeding. Biotechnology can reduce farmers' reliance on chemicals. The report dealt with many of the common fears about biotechnology, including the scares about the monarch butterfly, antibiotic resistance, allergens, cross-breeding with nearby plants and so on, and concluded that GM plants and foods pose no greater risks than those developed through traditional methods.It also found that there is no evidence that transferring genes from unrelated organisms to plants - stories of fish genes in tomatoes and so on - poses unique risks. (Incidentally, humans share 50 per cent of their genes with bananas.) In fact, according to this report, biotech procedures allow for much more careful control and monitoring of risk than classical breeding techniques. According to Nick Smith, the chairman of the committee, 'in the case of agricultural biotechnology, the scientific community is as united as I have ever seen it on any major issue'.This won't be enough for anti-science, anti-any-unknown-risk zealots, but isn't it enough for the rational man or woman? One of the most exciting things about biotechnology is that it is actually very green. GM plants can produce higher yields, in less favourable climates, with less ploughing, less fertiliser and less insecticide, or less toxic insecticide. That means less pollution, less soil erosion, less soil exhaustion, fewer chemicals in the food chain and less back-breaking work for humans and animals.It means using less or no new land, leaving more land uncultivated and wild; organic farming would certainly mean cultivating more land than now. It means that more wild life could survive; scares about butterflies have proved insubstantial. Of course there are all kinds of problems. The worst is the problem of trust. Hardly anyone really trusts big business or governments any more; perhaps we should have an international Citizens' Advice Bureau of disinterested, world-class scientists. But biotechnology for farming is an opportunity not to be missed. As Darwin said: 'It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.'"
telegraph,18/04/2007 00:01,finance,Key European legislation to allow companies to register medicines made from stem cells could be scuppered by a Slovakian politician.         The biotechnology industry is waiting today to see whether the Euro-MP Miroslav Mikolasik will table last-minute spoiling amendments to a law that would create a uniform system for registering advanced new medicines.         The law has been in the making since 2001 and is seen as crucial for pushing forward Europe's stem cell industry.         Several medicines based on embryonic and adult stem cells are on the market in the US but have not been registered in Europe.         Biotechnology companies say it is too difficult and expensive to gain approval in Europe because countries' regulations vary dramatically.         The biotechnology industry and patient groups have lobbied for medicines from stem cells and gene therapy to be registered at a Europe-wide level.         Mr Mikolasik said he would table two amendments that would remove stem cells from the impending law on advanced medicine.         The European Parliament will vote early next week.
telegraph,24/10/2006 00:01,news,"Michael J Fox, the Hollywood actor stricken by Parkinson's Disease, has pleaded with American voters not to restrict research into stem cell technology in an emotional intervention on the eve of mid-term elections.                                        Fox appeared in a television advert for the Missouri Democratic candidate Claire McCaskill. She is challenging the sitting senator Jim Talent in a state that is also voting to amend its constitution to protect stem cell research within its borders.          Since retiring from acting after being diagnosed with the disease, Fox has become an outspoken campaigner for stem cell research. 'In Missouri, you can elect Claire McCaskill, who shares my hope for cures,' Fox, best known for his role in Back To The Future, said.          'Unfortunately senator Jim Talent opposes expanding research. Senator Talent even wanted to criminalise the science that gives us a chance for hope.          'What you do in Missouri matters to millions of Americans — Americans like me.'          The issue of stem cell research is deeply divisive in America. Conservative politicians face a delicate balancing act when considering the demands of voters, particularly older citizens, and the concerns of religious groups over stem cell research.          Missouri Amendment 2 guarantees all citizens rights to the benefits of stem cell technology and affirms that researchers in the state can conduct experiments into stem cell therapies permitted by federal law. While Sen Talent supports research on adult stem cells, he opposes the amendment because it opens the way to use of embryonic cells.          In September, President George W Bush used his legislative veto for the first time to stop a relaxation of federal funding rules on stem cell research. He said: 'If this bill were to become law, American taxpayers would, for the first time in our history, be compelled to fund the deliberate destruction of human embryos.'          Fox's private foundation for research into Parkinson's Disease is the second-largest source of funding for research into a cure for the condition after the American state."
telegraph,30/10/2014 00:01,news,"More than twenty of Europe's most prominent plant scientists today signed a joint letter warning that Europe will never meet agricultural targets unless it starts allowing GM crops 'We all depend on plants for providing us with food, building material,   textiles, medicine and fuel. Among the greatest challenges facing mankind   are the provision of healthy and nutritious food, feed and fuel to a   burgeoning population using agricultural and forestry practices that are   environmentally and economically sustainable. Thanks to basic research on   plants, we now understand well how plants grow, how they protect themselves   against disease and environmental stress, and what factors limit production   in agriculture and forestry. Europe has a strong history of plant science. Robert Hooke introduced the   concept of the “cell” in the 17th century after looking at cork slivers in   his microscope. Carl Linnaeus developed systematics after his studies of plants and Gregor   Mendel deciphered the laws of genetics after meticulous counting of plants   in his monastery garden in Brno. Plant scientists discovered chromosomes,   enzymes and viruses, and Charles Darwin spent a large part of his scientific   career as a plant biologist; “The origin of species” starts “When we look to   the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated   plants and animals...”. Curiosity-driven plant research has been important both to deepen our   understanding of nature and take benefit of it, still we lack basic   understanding of many complex phenomena in plants. 27 of the “30 most cited   authors in plant science” in Europe hold at present a position at a publicly   funded research organization in Europe, and 21 out of the 27 have signed   this letter. We work on various aspects of plant science, for example   systematics, physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics,   ecophysiology, ecology, pathology, biodiversity and effects of climate   change. It is possible to perform good curiosity-driven plant science in   Europe and we acknowledge our support from various funding bodies, in many   respects plant science in Europe is doing well. However, well is not good enough. Plant science has arguably contributed more   to the reduction of human suffering than biomedical research, yet compared   with the latter it is hugely underfunded worldwide. Norman Borlaug’s dwarf   and rust-resistant varieties of wheat saved many millions from hunger. Basic   science performed in Europe is also an efficient way of supporting applied research in poorer   countries. We are concerned that Europe will have serious problems in reaching its   ambitions of Horizon 2020: to “tackle societal challenges” and “to ensure   Europe produces world-class science, removes barriers to innovation and   makes it easier for the public and private sectors to work together in   delivering innovation” and see three outstanding issues for decision makers   to address. First, to provide solutions to the societal challenges outlined in Horizon   2020 funding for fundamental and applied plant science should be maintained   or, if possible, be increased. Most importantly, serious challenges are not   adequately addressed, such as developing plants resilient to climate change,   preventing loss of crop biodiversity, and creating an agriculture that   avoids unsustainable demands for water, energy, fertilizers and pesticides.   These tasks must be addressed in forthcoming Horizon 2020 calls. Secondly, plant scientists must be able to perform field experiments. Many of   us work with genetically modified plants as research tools, for example to   understand how native plants and crops protect themselves against pests and   will react to climate change. However, in most European countries permits to   perform field experiments with transgenic plants are blocked, not on   scientific but on political grounds. In countries that do permit field   experiments, these are often systematically vandalized, causing huge   scientific and financial losses. Some of us have even been threatened and   had private property vandalized. This is a serious threat to science, to   publicly funded research, and to European society itself. European   authorities must ensure that approved and safe field experiments with   transgenic plants are made possible. Vandals must be prosecuted and held   accountable for scientific and financial damage. Thirdly, Europe must allow prompt authorization of genetically modified plant   varieties that have been found safe by the competent authority following a   thorough science-based risk evaluation. This is essential to meet the   Horizon 2020 goal of removing barriers to innovation and making it easier   for the public and private sectors to work together in delivering   innovation. The de facto moratorium on transgenic plant approvals has been   detrimental for applied plant science and has effectively eliminated   possibilities for publicly funded scientists and small companies to address   the big challenges for society. The resulting reduced competition has   enhanced the dominance of the major seed and agrochemical corporations. We   believe that a fundamental revision of GM regulation is needed that strictly   follows principles of a science-based evaluations and approvals, based on   evaluation of the trait, rather than the method by which it is achieved. Our scientific credibility comes from our work on basic plant science. Some of   us also apply our knowledge to improving plants for the human society, but   the reason that we make this statement is not commercial interests or hope   of attracting more funding for our own research. Instead, we are seriously   concerned that lack of adequate funding and safe infrastructures will   relegate European basic and applied plant science to a second tier status.   If plant scientists cannot apply their knowledge for the benefit of society,   Europe will be unable to lead in global efforts to build a sustainable   agricultural system and plant-based bio-economy. The most pressing global   problems – how do deal with environmental change and secure food supply for   all – arguably will only be solved with a massively increased worldwide   investment in plant research.'

telegraph,11/5/2011 20:00,news,"Patients with advanced liver disease can be treated with stem cells taken from their own skin or blood in a breakthrough that could save thousands of lives and cut transplant waiting lists.Researchers have found a way to cheaply produce millions of the cells that can   be injected into the organ and help regenerate it. The technique involves converting skin and blood cells back to their original   stem cell state and then into liver cells. These were then injected into a liver with cirrhosis. More than a tenth of the stem cells – – the most basic form of cell that can   convert into any other cell – grafted on to the liver and started working   without any significant side-effects. The advantage of using stem cells taken from skin or blood – known as   induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) – is that they are cheap and can be   multiplied easily in the laboratory. Because they are from the patient there is also less danger of the body having   a reaction to it. The only other source of stem cells at the moment is from embryos and this is   fraught with ethical issues.  'Our findings provide a foundation for producing functional liver cells   for patients who suffer liver diseases and are in need of transplantation,'   said Professor Yoon-Young Jang, at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, in   Maryland.  'iPSC-derived liver cells not only can be generated in large amounts,   but also can be tailored to each patient, preventing immune-rejection   problems associated with liver transplants from unmatched donors or   embryonic stem cells.' Although the liver can regenerate in the body, end-stage liver failure caused   by diseases like cirrhosis and cancers eventually destroy the liver's   regenerative ability, Jang says. Currently, the only option for those patients is to receive a liver organ or   liver cell transplant, a supply problem given the severe shortage of donor   liver tissue for transplantation iPSCs are made from adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to   revert to an embryonic stem cell-like state, with the ability to transform   into different cell types. Human iPSCs can be generated from various tissues, including skin, blood and   liver cells. For the study, Prof Jang and colleagues generated human iPSCs   from a variety of adult human cells, including liver cells, bone marrow stem   cells and skin cells. Next, they chemically induced the iPSCs to differentiate first into immature   and then more mature liver cell types. Using mice with human-like liver cirrhosis, the researchers then injected the   animals with two million human iPSC-derived liver cells or with normal human   liver cells. They discovered that the iPSC-derived liver cells engrafted to the mouse liver   with an efficiency of eight to 15 per cent, a rate similar to the   engraftment rate for adult human liver cells at 11 per cent. Researchers also found the engrafted iPSCs worked well behaving like normal   liver cells. Now the researchers hope to carry out trials in humans. One concern has been the potential for embryonic stem cells or iPSCs to cause   tumours, though no tumours formed in any of the transplanted mice during the   seven months they were studied – the equivalent to more than 30 years in a   human life. The research is published in the journal of Science Translational Medicine. "
telegraph,6/5/2010 16:17,news,"Physical exercise may help to protect memory as it triggers the regeneration of brain cells that are lost with age, a study suggests.Scientists believe the discovery may lead to new ways of tackling age-related   memory loss or the effects of brain injuries or Alzheimer's disease.It used to be thought that from birth onwards brain cells died off but were   not replaced.Now it is known that at least some nerve cells can be replenished in the   hippocampus, the brain region that plays a key role in learning and memory.However, a large proportion of the stem cells that give rise to new neurons   remain dormant in adults.The new research in mice shows how these cells can be ''kick-started'' into   action by physical activity or epileptic seizures.Scientists in Germany found that physically active mice developed more newborn   hippocampal neurons than inactive animals.''Running promotes the formation of new neurons,'' said study leader Dr Verdon   Taylor, from the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology in Freiburg.Abnormal brain activity, as occurs during epileptic seizures, also appeared to   trigger neuron generation.Excessive formation of new nerve cells is thought to play a role in epilepsy,   said Dr Taylor, whose research appears in the journal Cell Stem Cell.The scientists identified different populations of neuronal stem cells in the   brains of mice, some of which were active and others dormant.''In young mice, the stem cells divide four times more frequently than in   older animals,'' said Dr Taylor. ''However, the number of cells in older   animals is only slightly lower. Therefore, neuronal stem cells do not   disappear with age but are kept in reserve.''In physically active mice, some previously dormant stem cells were seen to   come back to life and start to divide.Other sporadically dormant stem cells were unaffected by physical activity but   awakened by epileptic seizures.A similar pattern of active and inactive stem cells probably occurs in the   human brain, said the scientists. It was likely that dormant stem cells   could be reactivated in humans in the same way they were in mice."
telegraph,3/3/2002 0:01,news,"PRO-LIFE groups are planning legal action to block embryonic stem cell research by scientists in Edinburgh and London.The Pro Life Alliance said yesterday that the research was legal only if the scientists could prove that it could not be carried out without using stem cells from human embryos. The Alliance claimed that the experiments could be performed using adult stem cells or embryos from animals such as gorillas. It said that it intended to seek a judicial review in the High Court.The Alliance also accused the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), the agency that granted the licences allowing the research to proceed, of refusing to disclose details of the proposed research.Religious and pro-life groups have condemned the use of human embryos, in spite of claims that the projects might lead to cures for illnesses such as diabetes, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Experiments on cloned and surplus human embryos were approved last week by a House of Lords committee.The committee ruled that the ethical objections were not sufficient to outweigh the potential benefits. It rejected claims by pro-life groups that advances in research using stem cells grown in adults have made embryo experiments unnecessary.On Friday, researchers at Edinburgh University's Centre for Genome Research and King's College London were given permission by the HFEA to use cells cultured from donated surplus embryos to work on treatments.Bruno Quintavalle, the director of the Pro Life Alliance, said, however, that the law made it 'quite clear' that a licence could be issued only if it was necessary for the research being pursued. 'So the question is, can any of this research be done in any other way? If it can, those licences are unlawful.'He said the organisation would want to seek a ruling from a judge when it had acquired more information about the nature of the research.'The trouble is that we don't know what factors the HFEA has taken into account or whose opinions it has sought. It has operated under a veil of secrecy.'If this research is all pure altruism, the scientists shouldn't mind the world knowing what they are getting up to. Perhaps commercial interests are at the forefront of what these scientists are getting up to. They want all the patents and commercial rights from their research.'He said that the Pro Life Alliance would write to the HFEA this week to press it to disclose full details of the licences. Prof Jack Scarisbrick, the chairman of Life, another pro-life group, said that experts now believed that most research could be carried out without using human embryos.High-profile figures including Christopher Reeve, the paralysed actor, and Nancy Reagan, the wife of the former American president, Ronald Reagan, who suffers from Alzheimer's, have backed the research. Despite this, pro-life groups said yesterday that hundreds of people suffering from these illnesses opposed it.Jenny Mackay, a 57-year-old mother of two from Scunthorpe, who has Parkinson's, said that experimenting on embryos was the equivalent of taking life. 'The scientists try to deceive people by calling it a pre-embryo or an early embryo but it is still an embryo. They are playing God.'Alison Davis from Dorset, who is confined to a wheelchair after being born with spina bifida, said: 'If this research could help someone like Christopher Reeve, then it might well help me. Nevertheless, I think it is profoundly wrong.'The scientists claim that the research will help to develop treatments for a range of degenerative and chronic diseases including strokes and heart conditions.The Centre for Genome Research is to establish stem cell lines to be deposited in a national stem cell bank next year. The HFEA was unavailable for comment yesterday."
telegraph,13/05/2010 18:00,news,"Scientists have artificially grown stem cells that can sense sound in the ear in a break through that could pave the way to a cure for deafness.The research, which involves regenerating the sensitive hair cells that turn   sound vibrations into nerve signals, was described as 'really exciting'   and could benefit millions of people. Humans are born with 30,000 hair cells in each ear. When the cells are lost or damaged – possibly due to exposure to excessive   loud noise or injury – it can lead to permanent hearing loss or tinnitus   (ringing in the ears). Damage to hair cells may also affect balance, causing symptoms of vertigo and   dizziness. Regenerating the sensory hair cells of the inner ear has been the holy grail   of deafness research. The new breakthrough is the culmination of 10 years' work by scientists in   California. A team led by Professor Stefan Heller, from Stanford University School of   Medicine, succeeded in programming mouse stem cells to develop into immature   hair cells. Viewed under an electron microscope, they were seen to have bundled structures   reminiscent of the hairlike tufts of 'stereocilia' that give the   cells their name. 'They really looked like they were more or less taken out of the ear,'   said Prof Heller. Most importantly, tests showed that the cells responded to being moved the way   hair cells do, by converting mechanical signals into electrical ones. Experts hope the cells, which could be made in large numbers from multiplying   stem cells, will provide an invaluable research tool for studying the   molecular basis of hearing and deafness. Further down the line, they may also help scientists find a way of coaxing a   patient's hair cells to renew themselves. The research is already being taken forward by scientists supported by the   Royal National Institute for Deaf people (RNID). Dr Ralph Holme, head of biomedical research at the charity, said: 'The   possibility that stem cells could one day be used to restore hearing is   really exciting and could benefit millions. 'RNID-funded research has shown that human stem cells can also give rise   to hairlike cells, an important step forward in developing a clinically   relevant therapy. 'We are now supporting research to investigate whether hearing can be   restored using these cells in preclinical models of deafness and to find   ways of scaling up the production of safe, clinical-grade cells.' David Corey, Professor of Neurobiology at Harvard University in Boston, said: 'This   gives us real hope that there might be some kind of therapy for regenerating   hair cells. It could take a decade or more, but it's a possibility.' The Stanford research, the first to create functional inner-ear cells, is   reported in the journal Cell. Prof Heller's team used both mouse embryonic stem cells and artificially 'induced'   stem cells made by reprogramming ordinary skin cells. Embryonic stem cells, removed from early-stage embryos, are 'mother'   cells with the ability to transform into virtually any kind of tissue in the   body. Induced stem cells have similar 'pluripotent' properties. In both cases, the cells were exposed to special cocktails of chemicals that   caused them to pass through a range of development phases normally seen in   the womb. 'We looked at how the ear develops in an embryo, at the developmental   steps, and mimicked these steps in a culture dish,' said Prof Heller. 'These cells have a very intriguing structure. They look like they have   hair tufts of stereocilia.' Inside the fluid-filled inner ear, hair cells respond to currents set up by   the vibrating ear drum via a set of tiny bones. The movements trigger electrical nerve impulses from the cells that are   transmitted to the brain. A similar property was observed in the lab-manufactured cells. "
telegraph,11/3/2004 0:01,news,"Scientists have discovered a new way to defy the     menopause which could change women's lives, they     announce today.                Their research raises the prospect of extending     childbearing years and offers a more natural alternative to     HRT to offset ageing and maintain youthful vigour.             The discovery that women may make eggs after     birth, rather than be born with all the eggs they would     ever have, could provide profound insights into the timing     of the menopause.             It is also likely to help to improve the success     of grafts of ovary tissue to restore fertility in women     after chemotherapy for cancer.             The study overturns a theory of female fertility     that has persisted for more than half a century and     discloses that ovaries may have hidden reserves, a find     with 'significant clinical implications'.             The work, published in the journal Nature, was     carried out at Massachusetts general hospital, Boston.             Dr Marian Damewood, the president of the American     Society for Reproductive Medicine, said it 'could be     the most significant advance in reproductive medicine since     the advent of IVF more than 25 years ago'.             That depends on whether the research is confirmed     and a way is found to tap this new-found reserve of female     fertility.             Every textbook on reproductive science indicates     that women are born with their lifetime's complement     of eggs which are steadily lost until the supply is     exhausted, leading to menopause.             But the textbooks may have to be rewritten. The     study suggests that women continue to produce eggs after     birth from special stem cells, which have been overlooked     until now.             The eggs derived from these cells also form new     follicles, where eggs ripen, which drive the production of     hormones. The project's leading author, Prof Jonathan     Tilly, said yesterday: 'These are basic biological     findings that may change everything in our field. Although     there is no way to say how long it may take for these     findings to actually affect the care of patients, we are     very excited.'             However, the study was done on mice and a leading     figure in the field, Prof Roger Gosden, was cautious.             He welcomed the research, but said:     'Reproductive biology is very variable between species     and, as yet, there is no evidence in humans contrary to the     old dogma that egg production ceases before birth.             'If we have been wrong, I will be     astounded.'             If today's findings hold in humans, 'all     theories about the ageing of the female reproductive system     will have to be revisited,' said Prof Tilly. The study     raises the issue of whether such things as smoking,     chemotherapy and radiation could harm these stem cells and     prematurely age the ovary, he said.             Now the cells have been identified, ways to delay     ovarian ageing - and extend fertility - can be studied.               Removing, storing and reimplanting these stem     cells could offer an alternative to storing mature eggs,     which is difficult, for fertility preservation in cancer     patients.             The same approach could be used to delay the     menopause. 'That is something we are very excited     about,' said Prof Tilley.             The work also suggests that therapeutic cloning -     where stem cells are derived from an early cloned embryo -     could make eggs for infertile women, though Prof Tilly said     this was difficult to achieve.             The team made the find by uncovering a     'dramatic inconsistency' in the numbers of dying     eggs and the reserve of eggs in juvenile and adult     life.             Treating prepubertal female mice with a chemical     known to kill stem cells caused ovarian failure by a     mechanism that did not involve destruction of eggs present     at the start of the treatment.             Examination of ovaries of young and mature mice     identified cells on the organs' outer surface that     resembled cells which are the source of eggs in foetal     animals - now recognised as stem cells.             The team showed that new egg cells develop and     form follicles in ovarian tissue in genetically altered     mice.             If the work applies to women, it may explain why     fertility declines after 30: that this might be due to     depletion of stem cells, rather than exhaustion of an egg     reserve laid down before birth.             The team is trying to isolate and store the stem     cells in mice so they can investigate how to prevent     ovarian failure and infertility caused by ageing or cancer     treatments, with a view to applying this research to     women.             Charlotte Woodhouse went through the menopause at     the age of 14 and pins her hopes of raising a family on a     breakthrough in research.             For the past few years the thought of a scientific     advance that could help delay or even reverse the menopause     has brought comfort to the 23-year-old, who lives in Biggin     Hill, Kent.             In her case, the new understanding of stem cells     would have to be combined with therapeutic cloning, a     contentious method under development that is more hope than     real substance.             No matter how experimental, she hopes the work can     help all women in her predicament. 'It would not     bother me being a guinea pig,' she said."
telegraph,21/03/2014 07:00,news,"Scientists have discovered that overweight teenagers who eat too much salt have shorter telomeres, the ends of the chromosome which protect the cells from harm Eating too much salt may speed up the ageing process, scientists have   discovered for the first time. Although sodium is known to raise the blood pressure, which can lead to fatal   heart attacks and strokes, it is the first time it has been linked to   cellular ageing. Scientists found that overweight or obese teenagers who had a high salt diet   had shorter ‘telomeres’ – the protective caps at the end of chromosomes –   compared with those who ate a low salt diet. Telomeres have been compared with the plastic tips that stop shoe laces   fraying. Each time a cell divides the telomeres get shorter and when they get too short   the cell stops dividing and dies. The same genetic process has been linked to conditions associated with old age   such as heart disease, cancer, type-2 diabetes and dementia. High levels of body fat were already known to hasten the shortening of   telomeres. But the new study found that sodium in salt seems to work hand-in-hand with   obesity to speed the effect up still further. Lead scientist Dr Haidong Zhu, from Georgia Regents University in Augusta, US,   said: 'Even in these young people, we can already see the effect of   high sodium intake, suggesting that high sodium intake and obesity may act   synergistically to accelerate cellular ageing. “Lowering sodium intake, especially if you are overweight or obese, may slow   down the cellular ageing process that plays an important role in the   development of heart disease. 'The majority of sodium in the diet comes from processed foods, so   parents can help by cooking fresh meals more often and by offering fresh   fruit rather than potato chips for a snack.' The glowing blue tip at the end of the chromosome at the top of the   picture represents a telomereDr Zhu's team divided 766 teenagers aged 14 to 18 into different groups   according to their reported sodium intake. Low-intake teens consumed an average of around 5g of salt a day, compared with   more than 10g grams for the high-intake group. In Britain the recommended   intake is 6g. A recent study showed the majority of teenagers exceed their   daily limit, mainly through eating bread and cereal. Researchers found that overweight or obese teenagers who at the most salt had   significantly shorter telomeres than those who ate the least. But high sodium intake did not have a significant effect on telomere   shortening in normal-weight teens. Although the salt link was only found in obese people it is the first time   that salt has been shown to affect cellular ageing. The research, presented at an American Heart Association meeting in San   Francisco, suggests a possible link with inflammation, said the scientists. Inflammation is known to hasten telomere shortening and is linked to obesity.   It also increases a person's sensitivity to salt. Katherine Jenner, Campaign Director at Consensus Action on Salt and Health   said: “Lowering your salt intake is essential to lower your risk of not just   heart disease, but also stroke, heart attack and chronic kidney disease. “As you might expect, teenagers often have a high salt diet, but it’s not just   pizza, crisps and chips that are the culprits, every day foods such as   breads, breakfast cereals and sauces can be surprisingly high in salt.”Nutritionist Sonia Pombo added: “Children are eating a worryingly high amount   of salt. “Dietary habits in childhood and adolescence are likely to influence eating   patterns in later life. “Liking salt and salty foods is a learned taste preference and the   recommendation that the adult population reduce their sodium intake will be   more successful if children do not develop a preference for salt in the   first place.”"
telegraph,17/02/2002 00:01,news,"SCIENTISTS have moved closer tocuring haemophilia and other inherited diseases after success in using gene therapy to treat dogs suffering from the disease.Gene transplants into the livers of people who have the crippling bleeding disorder haemophilia B are under way in America following the results, which are seen as an important test of whether gene therapy can cure such illnesses.Two patients have received small doses in their liver, Dr Katherine High told the American Association for the Advancement of Science's annual meeting in Boston.To date, gene therapy has had only limited success, such as in treating rare disorders of the immune system. The haemophilia trials may represent a milestone in gene-based medicine, with implications for many other genetic and acquired diseases.Haemophilia B, an inherited bleeding disorder that affects around one in 30,000 males worldwide, lends itself to gene therapy because even small increases in the deficient blood-clotting factor can result in great improvements.Currently, patients with severe haemophilia receive frequent intravenous infusions of a clotting factor made by biotechnologists, which can cost up to $300,000 annually and sometimes trigger an immune response that makes the treatment ineffectual.Earlier gene transplants into muscle have cut the dependence of eight haemophiliacs on the expensive injections. Experiments on dogs, however, suggest that significantly greater levels of the missing factor can be made - about 10 per cent of normal levels - if genes are injected into the liver, rather than muscle, without any risk of an immune response.Late next month four men will be injected with large dose of the genes in the liver, enough to produce a significant improvement in quality of life if it works.Dr High said that if they make just five per cent of the normal amount of clotting factor, they would be free of the need for injections.Dr High, a haematologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, is one of the world's pre-eminent gene therapy experts and has conducted work with Avigen, the biotechnology company.She explained that because a single defective gene causes haemophilia B, gene therapy involves inserting a normal version of the gene, which makes a normal protein - the clotting factor IX - using a genetically engineered form of a common virus called adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a vector, or delivery vehicle.In partnership with Stanford University, the Children's Hospital carried out early-stage clinical trials in adult patients with hemophilia B and reported in 2000 that the gene introduced with the virus induced patients' cells to produce clotting factor IX.There were no serious side-effects of the treatment, which delivered the gene by direct injection into the patients' leg and arm muscles, and they managed to generate about one or two per cent of normal levels of the factor, which reduced dependence on injections.Last August in Philadelphia the first patient, a 67-year-old man whose grandson also had the disease, was treated in the liver, though researchers became concerned when tests revealed that the virus had also got into his semen. The trials were halted.This contamination did not persist beyond a few weeks, and new safety studies and studies of rabbits indicated that gene transfer probably does not occur in the sperm cells. Gene therapy researchers must strictly avoid altering the DNA of germ line cells, such as sperm, to avoid the potential of transferring unknown effects to a patient's children.In response to the safety studies, the US Food and Drug Administration permitted the liver-directed clinical trial to resume in December last year.In Britain, a team from the Royal Free Hospital in London has had talks with the Government's gene therapy advisory committee, which regulates genetic experiments on patients, to carry out similar treatments."
telegraph,21/11/2014 01:00,news,"Specialists discovered a tapeworm living in a British man's brain A parasitic tapeworm lived in the brain of British man for four years before   doctors realised it was there, it has emerged. The 50 year old first visited doctors in 2008 suffering from headaches,   seizures, memory loss and complaining that his sense of smell had changed. An MRI scan showed a cluster of what appeared to be lesions in his brain, but   specialists were baffled as to the cause. And they were more surprised to   find that the lesions kept moving. Brain scans over the next four years   showed that the anomaly had travelled at least 5cm through the tissue. Over the years, doctors at St Thomas’ Hospital in London took biopsies and   tested the man for a number of diseases included HIV, lime disease,   syphilis. However in 2012 they were amazed to find that among brain tissue   was the remains of ‘10 cm ribbon-shaped larval worm.’ Once diagnosed the man   was treated easily with drugs to kill the worm and has now completely   recovered. The tapeworm, Spirometra erinaceieuropaei, has been reported only 300 times   worldwide since 1953 and has never been seen before in the UK. The worm causes ‘sparganosis’ inflammation of the body’s tissues in response   to the parasite. When this occurs in the brain, it can cause seizures,   memory loss and headaches. The worm’s rarity means that little is known about its complex lifecycle and   biology, however it is thought that people may be infected by accidently   consuming tiny infected crustaceans from lakes, eating raw meat from   reptiles and amphibians, or by using a raw frog poultice – a Chinese remedy   to calm sore eyes. It is unclear how the patient picked it up, but he is of Chinese origin and   frequently returned to his home country. The tapeworm can be seen in slide ANow scientists have sequenced the genome of the worm to try and learn more   about the dangerous parasite. “We did not expect to see an infection of this kind in the UK, but global   travel means that unfamiliar parasites do sometimes appear,” says Dr   Effrossyni Gkrania-Klotsas, study author from the Department of Infectious   Disease, Addenbrooke’s NHS Trust. “We can now diagnose sparganosis using MRI scans, but this does not give us   the information we need to identify the exact tapeworm species and its   vulnerabilities. “Our work shows that, even with only tiny amounts of DNA from clinical   samples, we can find out all we need to identify and characterise the   parasite.”Spirometra erinaceieuropaei’s genome is 1.26Gb long, making it ten times   larger than other tapeworm genomes and one-third the size of the human   genome. Some of this seems to come from an increase in the number of genes that may   help the parasite to break up proteins and invade its host, coupled with the   fact that the genome is much more repetitive than other tapeworm genomes. “For this uncharted group of tapeworms, this is the first genome to be   sequenced and has allowed us to make some predictions about the likely   activity of known drugs,” says Dr Matt Berriman, senior author and member of   Faculty of the Sanger Institute. “The genome sequence suggests that the parasite is naturally resistant to   albendazole – an existing anti-tapeworm drug. “However, many new drug targets that are being explored for other tapeworms   are present in this parasite and could offer future clinical possibilities.”The case was presented in the journal Genome Biology.

A study found that too much sitting down shortens telomeres, the protective   caps which sit at the end of chromosomes. Scientists found that the less time a person spent sitting, the longer   their telomeres, and the greater their chance of living longer Short telomeres have been linked to premature ageing, disease and early death.   So spending less time on the sofa could help people live longer by   preventing their DNA from ageing The research found that people who were frequently on their feet had longer   telomeres, which were keeping the genetic code safe from wear and tear. Intriguingly taking part in more exercise did not seem to have an impact on   telomere length. Prof Mai-Lis Hellenius, from Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, said   : 'In many countries formal exercise may be increasing, but at the same   time people spend more time sitting. 'There is growing concern that not only low physical activity but   probably also sitting and sedentary behaviour is an important and new health   hazard of our time. 'We hypothesise that a reduction in sitting hours is of greater   importance than an increase in exercise time for elderly risk individuals.' Telomeres stop chromosomes from fraying, clumping together and 'scrambling'   genetic code. Scientists liken their function to the plastic tips on the ends of shoelaces,   and say that lifespan is linked to their length. Researchers looked at 49 overweight sedentary adults in their late sixties and   measured the length of the telomeres in their blood cells. Half of them had been part of an exercise programme that lasted six months,   while the other half had not. Physical activity levels were assessed using a diary and pedometer to measure   the amount of footsteps taken each day. The amount of time spent sitting down was worked out through a questionnaire. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, revealed that although   people who did more exercise tended to be healthier, the most important   factor was how much time they spent sitting down. Scientists found that the less time a person spent sitting, the longer their   telomeres, and the greater their chance of living longer. The study was published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. "
telegraph,18/01/2009 19:50,news,"Stem cells are to be injected into patients to try to repair brain damage in a medical first that will put British scientists at the forefront of research into incurable diseases. The controversial treatment involves taking stem cells from an aborted foetus and injecting them into the brain of stroke victims. It is hoped the cells, which can renew themselves, will regenerate areas damaged by stroke, and increase patients' movements and mental abilities. If the trials are successful, they could replicate the achievements of scientists in Spain who in November last year announced the world's first tissue-engineered whole organ transplant using a windpipe made with the patient's own stem cells.However, the move has been described as 'sick' by pro-life groups who say the use of aborted foetuses is unethical.Four groups of three patients will be given the treatment over the next two years, starting with a low dose of two million foetal stem cells and rising to 20 million.Dr Keith Muir, the consultant surgeon leading the trial at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow, said: 'If it works, as it has done in animal model systems, it may allow new nerve cells to grow or regeneration of existing cells and actual recovery of function in patients who would not otherwise be able to regain function.'Stroke is the largest cause of disability in Britain – affecting 150,000 people a year – and the third commonest cause of death after heart disease and cancer, according to The Stroke Association. The only current treatment is physiotherapy which aims to restore brain function.Dr Muir said: 'You can reorganise the brain, you can help that reorganisation with physiotherapy but you cannot cause new nerve cells to grow. The hope with stem cell therapy is that by putting in new cells and new tissue that you can further improve on that recovery.'The trials are being funded by ReNeuron, a stem cell research company based in Guildford, Surrey. It applied to begin trials two years ago in the United States but could not secure permission from the US Food and Drug Administration. However, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency has given its approval for trials in Britain. Dr John Sinden, ReNeuron's chief scientific officer, predicted that the decision, coupled with the recent transplant in Spain, would encourage other research firms to seek permission for trials in the UK and Europe rather than the United States. 'Europe is going to be the centre in stem cells and regenerative medicine and that is very exciting,' he said.Professor Sir Christopher Evans, biotech entrepreneur and one of the founders of ReNeuron, added: 'This is a hugely important milestone for stroke victims and British science.'The Society for the Unborn Child described the proposal as 'sick', saying it involved 'cannibalising an unborn child'.Stem cells for the trial need only be taken once from a foetus because they can be copied by scientists. However Josephine Quintavalle, a director of the Christian campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: 'Even using just one foetus in this way is wrong. The stem cells will have been taken from a healthy foetus. Would any woman want her unborn baby have its brain used in this way?' "
telegraph,11/6/2013 20:30,news,"Stress really can cause your hair to turn grey, according new research.But for those hoping to avoid going grey by relaxing on the beach this summer,   there could be further bad news – too much time in the sun can also have the   same affect. A new study has shown that high levels of stress hormones in the skin can   cause hair follicles to be stripped of a type of stem cell that gives hair   its colour. Over time, these stem cells, known as melanocytes stem cells, can be reduced   to the point that strands lose their natural colour, leaving them grey or   white. The researchers also found that damage to skin caused by ultraviolet light   could also cause these stem cells to leave the hair follicle as the body   uses them to aid any repairs. “Our results may provide insight into the relationship between stress hormones   and hair greying,” said Dr Mayumi Ito, assistant professor of dermatology at   New York University’s Langone Medical Centre. “Ultraviolet type b irradiation induced similar melanocyte migration,   suggesting that melanocyte stem cells residing in the hair follicle may   contribute to ultraviolet light induced skin tanning.” Melanocytes are cells that produce a pigment known as melanin, which is   responsible for skin and hair colour. When a person tans, their skin   produces more melanin. However, the new findings, which are published in the journal Nature   Medicine, suggest that the skin can steal melanocyte stem cells from   a reservoir in the hair follicle. In mice with high levels of a stress hormone known as melanocortin 1, more of   these stem cells migrated from the hair follicles to areas of damaged skin   than in those unable to produce the hormone. Using mice and samples of skin from human scalps, the researchers also found   that ultraviolet light caused the stem cells to leave the hair follicle. The research, however, has raised hopes that it may lead to new treatments   against premature greying. The findings build on previous research that has suggested while premature   greying can be inherited genetically, environmental factors such as   pollution, diet and smoking can all play a role. Researchers at cosmetic company L’Oreal have been developing a new treatment   by mimicking   an enzyme that helps to protect the melanocyte stem cells from being   used up. However, the treatment would need to be taken many years in advance of hair   turning grey to have an affect. Frauke Neuser, principal scientist at Procter and Gamble, added that for most   people, hair dye may still be the best solution to greying. She said: “Genetic predisposition is the main factor determining when and how   quickly we turn grey. 'However, recent research suggests that environmental factors, such as   oxidative stress, might also contribute to greying, although the full extent   of their impact is not fully known yet. “It is unlikely that a cosmetic product will ever be able to solve this and it   will probably require a medical intervention. “Anything that can shed light on why we may go grey could help people to   change their behaviour to delay it for as long as possible.” "
telegraph,28/09/2007 00:01,news,"Tens of thousands of patients with MS could benefit from the revolutionary treatment if the tests taking place at the Frenchay hospital, near Bristol, are successful.                                       The procedure involves patients being injected with stem cells taken from their own bone marrow, in the hope that they will travel to damaged parts of the brain and repair them.         It could take months or years for the treatment to begin to undo the damage caused by the incurable disease, which affects the central nervous system, and it is not known for sure that it will work.         But researchers are confident the stem cell therapy will be a major breakthrough for the 85,000 people in Britain who suffer from MS, many of whom are left wheelchair-bound and paralysed.         Neil Scolding, professor of clinical neurosciences for North Bristol NHS Trust, who is leading the trial, said: 'We believe that bone marrow cells have the capability to repair precisely the type of damage that we see in the brain and spinal cord in MS.         'So by giving patients very large numbers of their own bone marrow cells we hope that this will help stabilise the disease and bring about some repair.'         The trial, which started six months ago, is one of the first to use patients' own bone marrow stem cells to treat their MS.         It involves six people with MS, aged between 30 and 60, having a pint of bone marrow extracted from their pelvises.         The processed material, containing stem cells, is then injected on the same day into the patients' arms.         Over a period of months, the patients will be monitored closely and given regular brain scans to see what impact the treatment has had on them.         Previous studies have shown that stem cells are able to develop into other cell types, travel through the bloodstream to the brain and are actively taken up by damaged areas.         The Frenchay trial avoids the ethical controversy that surrounds many stem cell studies because it does not use human embryos.         Although the first patients in the trial underwent the stem cell therapy six months ago, Prof Scolding said it was still too early to tell whether there had been any benefits. It is not yet known whether the MS sufferers will need more than one injection of stem cells.         Liz Allison, an MS patient taking part in the trial, told the BBC: 'I'm hoping there will be some improvement.'         Christine Jones, the chief executive of the MS Trust, said: 'We're delighted that this new trial is going ahead and there will be an awful lot of people with MS watching it very closely.'         MS sufferers have previously been offered stem cell therapy in Holland. But those tests have proved controversial because they are expensive and because the cells are taken from babies' umbilical cords. This raises the risk that they will be rejected by the patient receiving them."
dailymail,22/06/2015 14:58,health,"The humble starfish may hold the secret of eternal youth, new research suggests.Swedish scientists say they have discovered that starfish - which can reproduce by cloning themselves - produce a special kind of DNA that doesn't age as it does in humans.However this unique genetic trait was only found in starfish that reproduced by cloning, rather than  sexually.The discovery relates to what are known as tiny structures called telomeres - biological caps found at the ends of chromosomes.They protect the DNA in  chromosomes from damage, much like the caps on the ends of shoelaces prevent fraying.As we get older, our telomeres get shorter and shorter, leading to DNA becoming damaged and raising the odds of age-related illnesses such as Alzheimer's, diabetes and heart disease.Shorter than average telomeres are seen as a sign of ill health and premature death.Lengths of telomeres protect genetic data, make it possible for cells to divide, and hold some of the secrets of how humans age and develop cancer.Project leader Helen Nilsson Skold, of Gothenburg University, explained: 'Each time a cell divides the telomeres shorten in length and as they shorten so we age.''Starfish, unlike humans, can reproduce both through cloning and sexually. 'When starfish clone the telomeres of the newly formed tissue emerge longer than the old tissue,' she added.The research could show how to make human DNA follow the same pattern, producing humans that could, in theory, stay young for their entire lives.Dr Skold explained: 'You can say that there is a rejuvenation when new tissue is formed during cloning as opposed to sexual reproduction.' In the study, the researchers examined the length of telomeres and population genetics of a starfish called coscinasterias tenuispina, which can reproduce both by cloning and sexually.The researchers wanted to find out whether the populations of starfish that were more likely to clone enjoyed better health and signs of delayed aging compared to those populations more prone to sexual reproduction.Both populations in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean were investigated.This rejuvenation of telomernivå in connection with the formation of new tissue during the cloning is probably one of  several explanations for the extraordinary good health and long telomeres in clones.'In addition, we saw that the telomeres were longer in the newly formed tissue than in the 'old' tissue of the same animal, says Helen Nilsson Sköld. The research is published in Heredity, an official journal of the Genetics Society.   "
telegraph,25/09/2010 23:00,finance,"The valley of death might bring to mind a hot, dusty desert in California, but it is also the name scientists give to the no-man's land that they must navigate to make their cutting-edge stem cell research a reality. That stark warning came last week as they urged the government to step up its   support for the field, or else risk a brain drain. 'There is a funding gap between the discovery and the translation. People   call that the 'valley of death' and that's what it is,' said Sir   Richard Sykes, chair of the UK Stem Cell Foundation. 'We need to translate and commercialise stem cell therapies, or   scientists will move away.' His comments highlight the central challenge facing scientists and businesses   in this space - how to take ground-breaking research from the laboratory to   market and turn a profit. Cell therapy, including stem cells, seeks potentially to use living cells as   cures or treatments for a range of conditions including debilitating   illnesses such as Parkinson's Disease, and sits within the scope of   regenerative medicine. This umbrella term encompasses a diverse range of technologies, but all are   concerned with the replacement or regeneration of human cells, tissues or   organs to restore or establish normal functions. What was once the preserve of academia and start-ups, regenerative medicine -   and its potential to treat significant diseases where mainstream medicines   have limitations - is proving increasingly attractive to big drug makers. During the past two years, GlaxoSmithKline has struck a $25m (£15.8m) alliance   with the Harvard Stem Cell Institute; Pfizer has established a dedicated   regenerative medicine unit; and earlier this month, AstraZeneca took its   first significant step into regenerative medicine using stem cells, signing   a deal with University College London to develop ways to repair eyesight in   people with diabetes. Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine bioprocessing at UCL, said the   'real buzz is turning cells into therapies'. 'Pharma is...looking for new products and the technology is now getting   to a stage where it's ready for prime time, it's ready for translation and   commercialisation,'Small and large companies alike, however, face the challenge of making the   leap from bench to bedside. ReNeuron, an AIM-listed stem cell therapy business, is trying to navigate that   gap. Before the year is out, the company hopes to be the first to embark on   early-stage clinical trials where stem cells will be injected into patients'   brains to assess whether they can repair areas damaged by stroke. Michael Hunt, ReNeuron chief exectuive, said they had first put a lot of time   and effort into assessing whether their cells would be capable of scale-up   and commercialisation. 'It's all very well having a cell that might have an effect, but how are   you going to convert that into something that is a marketable therapeutic?' That is a question also being asked by big pharma. Dr Ruth McKernan, Pfizer's   chief scientific officer for regenerative medicine, said: 'How [cells]   behave in the lab and how valuable they are as a therapy doesn't always   translate. We can only really understand their usefulness from doing   clinical studies and those take a long time.'That is echoed by Dr Jason Gardner, head of Glaxo's stem cell discovery unit,   who said: 'In order to make this into a viable medicine, you have to   demonstrate clinical benefit otherwise you're not going to be able to get   those medicines reimbursed and doctors will not use them.'But if the science can be translated, regenerative medicine could ultimately   be a route to a cure for certain diseases. 'The business opportunity here is to potentially offer the patient a cure   for certain diseases or recovery of a function or capability that had   previously been damaged or lost,' said Dr Alan Lamont, director of   science and technology alliances at Astra. 'For example, the opportunity to repair cardiac damage following a heart   attack...may provide a significant improvement to these patients and would   complement existing medicines in these areas.'But if and when such therapies become available remains a moot point. Prof Mason   thinks that within the next two decades, there could be around 100   cell-based therapies on the market, while David Bott - a director at the   Technology Strategy Board, which supports regenerative medicine companies -   says he would be surprised if 20 years out, these therapies were not having   a 'real impact'. As for the value of these therapies, Prof Mason said the market for cell   therapies approved by Europe or the US, is currently worth between $100m and   $200m. But he believes that within the next two to three decades, it could   become a 'multi-billion pound-a-year industry'. But the question remains, how large pharma companies would drive sales from a   product that could prove fundamentally different from their traditional   drugs in terms of distribution and application.Where they are used to marketing medicines taken to manage a condition, cell   therapies would potentially be a one-off, or short course of treatment, that   cures a disease. 'The value proposition is completely different,' said Navid Malik,   an analyst at Matrix. 'It doesn't fit well with an approach whereby   it's a chronic treatment and you take a pill forever. It fits with the model   that you're trying to treat the underlying disease in its entirety. If   successful, the patient will not need additional therapy.''Quite frankly, it's probably not a perfect product space for   pharmaceutical companies because it will not allow them to drive an annuity   revenue stream. It will be a finite revenue stream but it will be a   significant benefit for the patient.'But, added Dr Malik, regenerative medicine is not a space that big pharma can   afford to ignore. 'At some point, the products that come through in this area are going to   compete directly with the pharmaceutical products themselves and the   pharmacuetical companies will have to change or adapt their business model   to embrace that.' Prof Mason believes that big pharma will move to encompass these therapies.   Two decades from now, he thinks they could comprise a major part of a   pharmaceutical company's portfolio, as companies adopt an 'arsenal of   approaches'. 'I think there will be a time 20 to 25 years from now where we may well   see small molecule, biologic and cells roughly one equal thirds of a large   company's portfolio. I don't think it will be the majority, but it will be a   significant part.'"

For Women in Science                                              UNESCO will announce five 2008 'laureates' at an event in Paris on 6 March to celebrate 10 years of the global For Women In Science programme, backed by the international cosmetic company L'Oréal.          While women have broken through the glass ceiling in many industries, female scientists still find it hard to reach the top. According to a recent UNESCO report, women account for only 27 per cent of researchers worldwide.         Women are still critically underrepresented in science professions, making up only 19 per cent of the UK's total science, engineering and technology workforce. Within the upper levels of science, women constitute an even greater minority, holding just 6 per cent of professorships.          No wonder then, when asked to name five famous female scientists, most people would struggle to get beyond Marie Curie. That's not surprising given that of the 521 Nobel prizes for science and medicine awarded between 1903 and 2007, only 12 were awarded to women: 7 in medicine, 3 in chemistry (Marie Curie, her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie and Dorothy Hodgkin) and 2 in physics (Marie Curie and Marie Goeppert-Mayer).         Baroness Susan Greenfield, the first female Director of The Royal Institution, and chair of the UK and Ireland for Women in Science programme, has complained that it is ' crazy to eliminate 50 per cent of the talent. It's also crazy to invest in educating and training people and then ignore them and their talent in later life.'          Since 1998, UNESCO and L'Oréal have awarded an annual prize of $100,000 to five leading women scientists, one per continent, to recognise exceptional research and identify role models for the science community, marking the first award of its kind.          The event in Paris will bring together Laureates and Fellows from around the world, to celebrate their remarkable achievements.                     Elizabeth Blackburn, US Laureate, 2008            Named one of Time magazine's '100 Most Influential People of the Year' in 2007, it was Elizabeth Blackburn's early research with pond scum, that has initiated her ground-breaking research that may lead to innovative ways to treat cancer and explore the process of ageing.         Blackburn was working on Tetrahymena, a pond protozoan, when she discovered telomerase, an enzyme that regulates the activity of telomeres. Blackburn describes telomeres as the 'protective caps at the ends of chromosomes in cells. Chromosomes carry the genetic information; telomeres are the buffers. They are like the tips of shoelaces. If you lose the tips, the ends start fraying.'         Chromosomes that lose their protective caps (telomeres) lose the ability to replenish themselves and no longer divide normally to give rise to healthy new cells. As we grow older, telomerase is not always active, and telomeres shorten. Conversely, telomeres also play a role in uncontrolled cancer growth. Telomerase levels are high in 80 to 90 per cent of malignant tumors, where the enzyme's activity causes the cancer cells to grow and divide rapidly.         Professor Blackburn's research has opened up a new area of inquiry into potential cancer treatments that would block production of the telomerase enzyme and thus hinder cancer cells' ability to replicate. The opposite approach could be considered for the treatment of age-related and neurodegenerative diseases: reactivating the enzyme to prolong cell life.         Professor Blackburn and her colleagues have recently reported that chronic psychological stress takes a toll on telomerase. Stress reduces the restorative effect of telomeres, decreasing the cell's capacity for self-renewal. This finding has implications for how stress may promote the earlier onset of age-related disease.                     Indira Nath, Asia Laureate, 2002            Winner of a L'Oréal-UNESCO Laureates award in 2002, Indira Nath is India's leading female scientist and an internationally renowned expert on leprosy.         In her role as Director of the LEPRA - Blue Peter Research Centre in Hyderabad (built with money raised through an appeal on the BBC children's programme) she works at the fore of India's fight against leprosy.         Of the numerous people who may contract the leprosy bacillus, not all of them develop the same form of the disease. Among those who develop lepromatous leprosy, its most serious form, Professor Nath identified a deficiency in the immune response system that was causing the disease. This discovery constituted a significant advance towards the development of treatments and vaccines.         When Nash started her career in the 1970s India had the largest number of leprosy patients in the world - 4.5 million people. Nath's work has helped see that number fall to less than 1 million today, with earlier detection and better treatment meaning that the awful disfigurements that were commonplace are now rare.                     Christine Van Broeckhoven, European laureate, 2006            Christine is a Professor in Molecular Genetics and Biology and a world authority on Alzheimer's.         A prolific scientist, Christine Van Broeckhoven has made seminal contributions to the understanding of the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and is recognised as a world authority on the disease.         Alzheimer's is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to its causes. One of Professor Van Broeckhoven's key contributions was to help identify the responsible genes and hence open up prospects for new therapies to slow the disease's progress.         Talking about her work she says; 'I am profoundly fascinated by the brain and all its activity … Direct contacts with my patients and their families have helped motivate me to continue my research even when things were not always going well. The fact that dementia takes away a person's being, his or her whole life, has enormously stimulated me to work hard to produce results.'                     Valerie Mizrahi, African laureate, 2000            A Research Professor, School of Pathology, University of the Witwatersrand Medical School, Johannesburg, Valerie Mizrahi's research in molecular biology has led to significant contributions in the fight against HIV, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases.         When still in her early 40's, she made significant contributions to the enzymology of HIV, the virus that causes Aids. Her recent work has focused on the mechanisms of DNA metabolism, culturability, and resuscitation in Mycobacteria tuberculosis, the organism that causes human tuberculosis.         In addition to her professorship at the University of the Witwatersrand Medical School, she is Alternate-Director, DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research, and Director of the Molecular Mycobacteriology Research Unit of the South African Medical Research Council, National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg.         Through these activities, she has become renowned for training a growing number of highly talented researchers.                     Mayana Zatz, South American laureate, 2001            Mayana Zatz has dedicated her life in science to research related to neuromuscular disorders, in particular Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a severe disease that affects young boys, causing progressive muscle degeneration. The Professor of Genetics and Director of the Human Genome Research Center, University of São Paulo, has also been active in working to improve the quality of life of affected families.         Neuromuscular disorders affect 1 in 1,000 individuals worldwide. Among the 30 different forms of muscular dystrophy, the Duchenne type is considered the most severe and the most prevalent, afflicting one out of every 3,000 baby boys.         Deeply concerned with the social and ethical difficulties facing families affected by these diseases, Mayana Zatz founded the Brazilian Muscular Dystrophy Association in 1981 to help families in any aspect that may improve their quality of life.         This includes material assistance, psychological support, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. Through diagnosis and genetic counseling, she has assisted almost 22,000 individuals in families affected by inherited neuropathies."
telegraph,25/06/2000 00:00,comment,"THERE are two golden ages: the mythical one in the past, and the mythical one in the future. While it is naive to believe in the former, it is now a sign of sophistication to believe in the latter. What will bring the imminent golden age to pass? The deciphering of the human genome, that makes man what he is, of course.Thanks to a hard-driving and brilliant maverick scientist called Craig Venter, this milestone in the history of science will be reached tomorrow, sooner than scheduled. The successful mapping of human DNA promises us - in the not very distant future - a life without cancer, without ageing, practically without death itself.Not only will our life expectancy be doubled, according to the optimists, so that we shall live to be 150 at least, but those genetic diseases that are not screened out during pregnancy and eliminated from the population by selective abortion will be treatable by gene therapy. We shall all be incomparably healthier, and therefore happier. Thanks to science, Man will have escaped what have hitherto seemed to be the inherent limitations of his existence. And death shall have no dominion.Of course there have been such dreams before, but never as well-founded as now. In the first third of this century, the heyday of endocrinological discovery (that is to say in hormonal science) it seemed that hormones held the key to eternal life and sexual potency. Even within my lifetime, ageing celebrities (including men of some intellect) would disappear to expensive Swiss clinics for 'rejuvenation' therapy. They thought that because they were rich and famous, they were entitled to live for ever: and since one cannot be entitled to something that is impossible, it followed that eternal life must be possible.Well, now it really is possible, or nearly so, if our newspaper headlines are to be believed. More than once in the recent past the discovery of the gene which causes ageing has been announced in our more serious journals, with the implicit promise that wrinkles and other undesirable concomitants of advancing years will soon be abolished. But is this belief any better founded than that in the table-rapping and ectoplasm of the spiritualists of the end of the last century, who did not want to admit to human mortality either, but were unable to accept the tenets of traditional religion?There is no disputing the scale of the technical achievement, whose pace is ever-increasing. Texts written this year refer to the 'primitive' techniques once employed - six or seven years ago. Texts of that era themselves refer to the 'primitive' techniques of six or seven years before that. A week is a long time in molecular biology.Of the 1,600 human disorders known to be inherited in simple Mendelian fashion - that is because of a defect in a single gene - the genes for 1,300 at least have been identified. The rest will not long resist the enquiries of researchers. And with the increasing automisation of genetic analysis, the day is not far off when it will be possible to have one's complete gene make-up tested in the same simple way (simple, that is, for the subject of the test, though far from simple technologically) as it is now possible to have one's haemoglobin and white cell count measured.No child need ever again be born with a straightforwardly inheritable disease: that is to say, 1,600 diseases will have been eliminated at a stroke. That is a lot of diseases, of course, but will their elimination mean the end of human suffering? No, for the obvious reason that only a very small proportion of the suffering caused by human disease (which itself causes only a small proportion of all human suffering) is caused by those 1,600 diseases.As to the diseases from which most people die (leaving aside the infectious ones which still cut a swathe through Africa), the role of the genes in their production is much more equivocal. It is true that there is an inherited predisposition to many, perhaps most, common diseases such as coronary artery disease, non-insulin dependent diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.There is even a genetic tendency to contract tuberculosis. But the way in which many genes operate to produce this predisposition is still not understood. And if the presence in an embryo of such predisposing genes were to result in an abortion in the same fashion as the presence of genes for any of the 1,600 straightforwardly inherited diseases will do so, the human race would soon abort itself to extinction.But is not gene therapy soon to put everything right? Again, no. It is perfectly possible for diagnostic techniques to run far ahead of therapeutic ones for many years. And so far effective gene therapy has proved much more difficult to achieve than was at first supposed. Even in those conditions in which there is a straightforward genetic error, leading to the absence of a protein, or the production of an ineffective or toxic one, gene therapy has not so far resulted in any curative advance.The reasons for this failure so far are easy to grasp. It is not just a question of introducing a gene into a cell (usually by means of a genetically engineered virus), but of introducing it into the right part of the pre-existing genome. So far, there is no means to do this.Moreover, the right protein has to be produced at the right time in the right quantities in the right place. It is not simply a question of whether the protein is produced or not. One might as well say that it doesn't matter when the clarinettist arrives in the orchestra, so long as he plays the notes. This attitude would very soon lead to cacophony, and a single human cell, let alone the entire organism, is incomparably more complex than any symphony.The way in which the cellular symphony is conducted is still not understood, though there is no reason why it should not come to be understood in the future. Knowledge is increasing almost exponentially, and what seemed impossible to know only a few years ago is now known. Nevertheless, there is still some way to go before gene therapy even of the straightforwardly inherited diseases becomes possible. The difficulties are even greater where the genetic contribution to the causation of disease is either slight or very complex.It is easy to be dazzled by the scientific and technological brio of the molecular biologists: perhaps it is more accurate to say that it is difficult not to be. And anyone who reads of the beautiful intricacy and the marvellous mechanisms of life is likely to be infused by an almost religious feeling of awe. With regard to the conditions of human life as it is experienced from day to day, however, we should keep our hats on. We should not exaggerate the importance of genetics in determining our fate.And it is very easy to exaggerate it. The predisposition to peptic ulcer was not so very long ago thought (on good evidence) to be genetic: but the discovery that it was caused by a hitherto ignored bacterium that lived in the stomach swamped and rendered irrelevant all speculation about the contribution of genetic predisposition. More recently, it has even been proposed that coronary artery disease (whose rise and decline in prevalence resembles an infectious epidemic) might be caused by an infectious organism.Genetic discoveries are sometimes distinctly oversold. The alleged discovery of genes for aggression, alcoholism, homosexuality and even criminality have all been announced in our press with considerable fanfare, a tentative and preliminary result being magnified and distorted. And though such findings have never yet been confirmed, the impression is undoubtedly created that an important aspect of human behaviour is inherited in the way that the colour of one's eyes is inherited.All such stories leave behind them a residue or sediment of belief, despite their subsequent undermining (rarely reported with anything like the same fanfare as the original story). The idea that how one behaves is inscribed in the genes like a recipe for fruit cake gains credence anyway.If we add the belief in the genetic determination of our behaviour to the belief that gene therapy will soon produce marvels, it is easy to see how completely unrealistic hopes about the geneticists' ability to solve all our problems can gain ground. Living well, indeed perfectly, will become a mere question of having - or if not of having, of inserting - the right DNA. By comparison with this belief, Madame Blavatsky's ideas were completely rational.Technical progress is technical progress, but it isn't anything else. Modern science is organised in such a way, on such a philosophical and administrative basis, that technical progress is inevitable, as long as there are no external forces to prevent science from continuing its activities. And most of us would not wish to forgo that progress once it has been made: few of us would wish, for example, to return to the days of the candle and the washing mangle.However, few of us would claim that the electric light bulb and the tumble dryer have eliminated human misery. Sorrows can be eliminated by technical means, but not Sorrow. The claim, therefore, that - thanks to the deciphering of the human genome - we are entering a completely new era of existence, which will exempt all those who are lucky enough to live in it both from illness and the travails of earthly existence, is false. And there is no better, more certain way to increase misery than to arouse false expectations of happiness."
telegraph,5/5/2010 18:00,news,"Thousands of MS sufferers could benefit from a revolutionary treatment that injects them with stem cells taken from their own bone marrow.Researchers have long believed that the stem cells could halt and even reverse   the effects of the disease by patching up the damaged parts of the brain and   spinal cord. Now British scientists carrying out one of the first ever trials into the   procedure believe that they have proved that it works. The research team, led by Professor Neil Scolding, at the University of   Bristol and North Bristol NHS Trust, believe that the treatment has   stabilised the condition and shown some 'benefits'.  'We are encouraged by the results of this early study,' he said.  'We believe that stem cells mobilised from the marrow to the blood are   responsible, and that they help improve disease in several ways.' MS or multiple sclerosis is an incurable disease that affects around 85,000   people in Britain slowly attacking the central nervous system and leaving   many sufferers eventually wheelchair bound. For some reason the immune system turns on healthy nerve cells and damages   them. Previous studies in the laboratory have shown that stem cells are able to   develop into other cell types, travel through the bloodstream to the brain   and are actively taken up by damaged areas. The trial, which lasted a year, is one of the first to use patients' own bone   marrow stem cells to treat their MS. It involved six people with MS, aged between 30 and 60, having a pint of bone   marrow extracted from their pelvises. The material is filtered of bone and fat leaving pure stem cells which are   then injected on the same day back into the patients' arms. Over the year, the patients were monitored closely and given regular brain   scans to see what impact the treatment has had on them. The study, journal Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, carried out at   Frenchay Hospital avoids the ethical controversy that surrounds many stem   cell studies because it does not use human embryos. Researchers found that the patients suffered 'no serious adverse effects'   from the treatment and tests suggested the disease was stable and there had   been improvement in the effectiveness of damaged nerve cells. They showed that the damaged nerve pathways were able to carry electrical   pulses more effectively after the treatment. Now the researchers want to carry out a longer and larger study to see if the   treatment can be improved and works consistently. Professor Neil Scolding said: “The safety data are reassuring and the   suggestion of benefit tantalising.' Dr Claire Rice, co-author, said: 'The results are very encouraging. We   would have expected these pathways to get worse but they have actually got   better.  'It is exciting because the treatment is relatively pain free and   patients do not need to stay overnight in hospital.' Bone marrow is known to contain stem cells capable of replacing cells in many   types of tissues and organs – and so is of great interest to those working   to develop new treatments for many diseases, including those affecting the   nervous system. An earlier study on 21 adults in the Lancet also showed that stem cells could   halt the progress of the disease and even show some improvement. The idea is that if caught early enough the stem cells could protect patients   from the permanent damage caused to nerve cells and prevent disability. "
telegraph,10/8/2012 7:00,news,"Tumour-treating electrical fields, a Victorian gout remedy, and an anti-cancer 'virus’. Meet the scientists tackling our most feared disease in some truly innovative waysEvery two minutes, someone in this country is diagnosed with it – and more   than one in three British men and women will develop it in their lifetime. Across the world, there are nearly 12.7million new cases every year. Of these,   about 7.5 million people will go on to die from the disease. The disease, of course, is cancer, the earliest evidence of which was   discovered in an Ancient Egyptian textbook on trauma surgery, describing   breast lumps removed by cauterisation and noting, grimly, that for this   disease “there is no treatment”. Over two thousand years later, the Greek   physician Hippocrates would use the terms carcinos and carcinoma to describe   non-ulcer forming and ulcer-forming tumours. Deriving from the word crab,   these words most likely referred to the shape of these malignant growths,   with their finger-like projections. “Cancer”, as we now know it, was born. And yet, despite the billions spent in   pursuit of cures ever since, it remains essentially mysterious. We do have a   far better idea of what might give us cancer. Fewer people smoke, dietary   awareness has increased and many known carcinogens have been removed from   the environment. Yet the disease goes on killing much as it has always done.   “If you look at the death rate from cancer, there’s no dramatic change over   the last five decades,” says the cancer specialist David Agus, author of The   End of Illness. A realist might say we are losing the battle against   cancer except where we are winning it. But there are grounds for optimism. New technologies are opening new avenues   of possibility. And at the cutting edge of the battle against cancer are   dozens of projects currently under way all over the world. Some are lavishly   funded, some operate on shoestrings, some are pursuing simple objectives,   others are pushing the frontiers of science. What they have in common is a   belief that humans can do far ­better against our most feared disease. Here   are just some of them. Prof Tim Illidge: the magic bullet In his laboratory in Manchester’s Christie Institute, one of the largest   cancer treatment centres in Europe, Prof Tim Illidge is busy developing what   he hopes will become a “magic bullet” against certain cancers. He is a   pioneer in the use of radio-immunotherapy, or training the body’s immune   system to recognise – and destroy – cancer cells. Immunotherapy — altering cells in a laboratory to make them better at fighting   cancer — has been known about for some time. The problem with it is that as   tumours become more advanced, they become less visible to the attacking   cells. Radio-immunotherapy adds the refinement of precisely targeted   radioactive molecules that can spot and “zap” cancer cells without damaging   healthy tissues. Prof Illidge gives the example of Mel, a retired ambulance driver who was   faced with an aggressive course of chemotherapy. “Instead, by attaching a   radioactive molecule to an anti-cancer antibody, we used his immune system   to kill the tumour cells,” Prof Illidge says. “It’s significantly better for   patients as it’s quicker with fewer side effects. We call it the 'magic   bullet’. Mel was delighted, and even managed to keep his ponytail.”Prof Jim Mccaul: the 19th-century gout cure Just as nothing can be too futuristic in cancer treatment, so nothing can be   too old-fashioned. Prof Jim McCaul, a head and neck cancer specialist at   Bradford Royal Infirmary, is conducting a trial using a 19th-century gout   remedy. Lugol’s Iodine was invented by French physician Jean Lugol in 1827, and has   been used for everything from cleaning cuts to purifying water. One of its   more interesting features is an ability to stain healthy cells – those   capable of storing glycogen – to a chocolatey-brown colour, while leaving   cancerous or pre-cancerous cells a paler hue. The importance of this   discovery is that surgeons operating on mouth and throat cancers currently   have no reliable way of knowing how much tissue to remove. Pre-cancerous   cells may be left behind or perfectly healthy ones cut out. The iodine trial, believes Prof McCaul, could lead to the current 10mm margin   around the cancer being reduced to 2mm. “It’s a simple idea,” he says, “but   it can take a lot of the guesswork out of surgery. We have tests going on in   12 sites and the results are encouraging. Previously, we would have expected   to have 32 per cent of patients left with pre-cancerous cells. That’s down   to four per cent.” Prof Jay Bradner: the miraculous molecule Every cancer pioneer builds on the work of others. Prof Jay ­Bradner, a   myeloma (bone marrow cancer) specialist at the Dana-Farber Institute in   Boston, took as his starting point the breakthrough discovery in the   Eighties that all cancer was tied into genetics. The problem might be   inherited or the result of exposure to outside agents such as smoke or   radioactivity, but in the end the cancer resulted from abnormalities in the   genes. Little wonder, then, that the Human Genome Project, which set out to   map the body’s 20,000-plus genes – and reveal the exact method by which the   genes went wrong – prompted such excitement. It didn’t turn out to be so simple. The genetic coding of a malignant cell   could look completely normal. Something else must be making it malfunction.   Many researchers, including Prof Bradner, believe that the epigenome –   basically the gene’s on-off switch – may hold the key. “You might ask yourself, with all the things cancer’s trying to do to kill our   patient, how does it remember it’s cancer?” Prof Bradner said in a recent   TED talk. “When it winds up its genome, divides into two cells and unwinds   again, why does it not turn into an eye, into a liver, as it has all the   genes necessary to do this? The reason is that cancer places little   molecular bookmarks, little Post-it Notes, that remind the cell: “I’m   cancer; I should keep growing.” Prof Bradner’s response? To develop a   molecule that would “prevent the Post-it Note from sticking” and trick   cancer cells into forgetting they were cancer. Focusing their research on a very rare but virulent cancer, midline carcinoma,   Prof Bradner and his team eventually came up with JQ1, a molecule to target   the protein that causes it. And as they watched their molecule in action   under the microscope, their excitement only increased: “The cancer cells,   small, round and rapidly dividing, grew these arms and extensions,” said   Prof Bradner. “They were changing shape. In effect, the cancer cell was   forgetting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell.”Prof Yoram Palti: the tumour-treating hat The key feature of cancer is mitosis, the phenomenon of errant cells dividing   and multiplying to form a tumour. One of the core goals of cancer   researchers has been to find a way to stop this, and prevent cancer’s   ability to spread. Prof Yoram Palti, founder of a small cancer treatment   company, Novocure Ltd, based in Haifa, Israel, has developed the idea of   using electrical fields that can disrupt the abnormal behaviour of   chromosomes in the affected cells and prevent them splitting. The company’s TTF (tumour-treating fields) device consists of a battery pack   and electrode pads that are worn under a hat for 20 hours a day. Roger   Stupp, a prominent American researcher who has championed it, says: “When I   first saw it I thought it was completely voodoo, goofy, nuts.” Yet trials   suggest TTF can significantly slow the spread of brain cancers, and the   company is developing a new range for breast and lung cancers. Danny Hillis: could proteins unlock cancer? Danny Hillis, a self-described “inventor, entrepreneur and computer geek”,   admits cutting an unlikely figure in the rarefied world of cancer research.   Yet his capacity for fresh thinking – as an engineering student at Harvard,   Hillis pioneered the concept of parallel computers that is now the basis for   most supercomputers – prompted his conviction that the world is thinking   about cancer in entirely the wrong way. Rather than being seen as something   to be treated with drugs and procedures, Hillis believes cancer should be   prevented at source. How? One answer Hillis, a flamboyant Californian,   offers, is proteomics, the study of proteins. Hillis believes proteins hold the real secret of cancer. The trillions of   cells in the human body, he says, are in constant conversation, working   co-operatively almost like the operating system of an advanced computer. The   proteins are the main carriers of information within the system. When they   relay false information, the body reacts wrongly and gets sick. This,   essentially, is what causes cancer. Proteomics can give us a means of   “listening in” on what the body cells are saying, and knowing when something   is going wrong. Hillis is no lone wolf. The pioneering oncologist Dr David Agus shares his   view that “cancer” is not one disease and that the conditions that fall   under it are far more varied than the medical establishment is prepared to   admit. The problem for disciples of proteomics is that not everyone has the   same kind of protein network, meaning that a way has to be found to “map”   the human body on an individualised basis. Scientists at Applied Minds, the   research and development company that Hillis co-founded in the Los Angeles   suburb of Burbank, are busy searching for the answer. Prof John bell: the anti-cancer virus A man-made virus that can attack cancer cells has long been a dream of medical   researchers – but for decades has remained just that. The possibility first   arose from a celebrated 1951 case of a young girl with leukaemia who   contracted chickenpox, sending the cancer into remission. The euphoria that   followed soon subsided as complications became apparent, notably the   tendency of the immune system to fight off the virus. New hope is emerging with the development in Ottawa, Canada, of JX-595, an   engineered virus that appears to overcome the early problems. It is based on   the vaccina virus, used in the development of smallpox vaccine. Unlike   previous anti-cancer viruses it has few ill effects on the healthy parts of   the body and can be administered into the bloodstream, rather than directly   into the tumour. “We are very excited,” says Prof John Bell at the University of Ottawa, the   project’s lead researcher, “because this is the first time in medical   history that a viral therapy has been shown to consistently and selectively   replicate in cancer tissue after infusion into humans.” Dr Timothy Ley: whole genome sequencing Sometimes cancer seems to know exactly who it is after. Last year it went   after Dr Lukas Wartman, a renowned leukaemia specialist at Washington   University. Dr Wartman, 34, had already fought off two youthful bouts of   leukaemia. His chances of surviving a third were virtually non-existent. But he had one advantage: his colleagues at the university’s pioneering genome   institute. Last July, the unit’s assistant director, Dr Timothy Ley, set the   team to work on a very special project, fully sequencing the genes of Dr   Wartman’s cancer cells, his healthy cells, and his RNA, a close chemical   cousin to DNA. It had never been tried on this type of cancer before, and it   required the institute’s scanning machines and supercomputer to run around   the clock. But they found the problem – a rogue gene that was producing   large amounts of a certain protein, spurring the cancer’s growth. Astonishingly, although it was only approved for kidney cancer, there was an   available drug to attack this gene. Dr Wartman’s leukaemia is now in   remission. Whole genome sequencing is a complex, uncertain and expensive undertaking.   When the Apple boss Steve Jobs had run out of other options to combat his   pancreatic cancer, he underwent a similar process to Dr Wartman, reputedly   costing him $100,000. Yet simpler variations of the procedure are becoming   available, and Dr Ley believes the big advances are still to come. “This is   the most powerful diagnostic tool we’ve ever had,” he says. “The more   sequencing we do, the more we understand these mutations.” This article also appeared in SEVEN magazine, free with the Sunday   Telegraph.

telegraph,13/05/2008 20:00,news,"Two English girls have taken part in an encouraging American gene therapy trial for Batten Disease, an incurable disorder that robs children of the ability to move, see and think.           This type of the disease, the 'late infantile' form, is caused by a faulty gene which has the effect of making waste build up in brain cells and is often fatal by the age of 12.            An implant of a normal version of the faulty gene into the brain was found to be safe and effective at slowing the progression of the disease in most patients, reports a team from New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Centre.            The results, which are encouraging enough to pursue in more studies, come in the wake of other promising findings in using gene therapy to treat forms of blindness and immune deficiency, showing that the two decade slog to realise the promise of the technology is finally paying off.           The clinical trial on six boys and four girls aged between four and nine found that gene therapy -- which involves injecting a harmless gene-bearing virus into the brain -- significantly slowed the disease progression in the 18 months that the children were followed.          But brain scans, though consistent with the trend, were not statistically significant.  The fate of the British girls was mixed.          One, a severely affected eight year old, died 49 days after gene therapy as a result of a severe seizure linked with the disease, though the team cannot rule out the possibility that her death was linked to the therapy.          The second was lost to the trial when she went to China for an experimental stem cell treatment.         Lead author Dr Ronald Crystal said that the patients and their families had asked for anonymity.           He stressed that the treatment was not expected to reverse existing damage but stabilise it.          'The virus is used as a Trojan horse that houses and then delivers a healthy, functional gene into the cells of the brain,' says Dr Crystal.          'The genes are incorporated within the genetic material of the cells'.           As a result, the children start to make the protein that they lack and the results published in the journal Human Gene Therapy also suggest the treatment is safe - there have been deaths linked with gene therapy.           The gene in question -- CLN2 -- is mutated in children with the disease, causing a deficiency in the enzyme TTP-1, which is responsible for ridding cells of the central nervous system of waste materials.          'It’s like the garbage man of the cell is not able to do its job,' says Dr. Crystal. 'The trash keeps getting backed up inside the cell until the cells can no longer function properly and then eventually die throughout the entire brain.'           The gene surgery was led by Drs Mark Souweidane and Michael Kaplitt.          Six tiny holes were made in the skull of each subject, and then a liquid containing the healthy CLN2 gene, within the harmless adeno-associated virus, was injected into the brain.          Unlike other viruses, this one does not insert the gene into the genetic code of the children, which has been linked with leukeamia in other gene therapy trials.           'Before now, we had no hope of a therapy for Batten disease, but today we can say that there is some hope,' says Dr. Crystal.          'These results are not just promising for sufferers of the disease, but suggest that gene therapy can work and should be studied for other neurological disorders. Each gene in our body has the potential to become a target to study for human disease.'           The earlier the disease is treated, the better, he said.          'You would like to treat before the disease manifests so you don’t lose brain cells,' says Dr Crystal, adding that experiments on mice show they live a long life if caught early.          The team is also to use a new kind of virus, which has been shown to be even more successful.           'On the surface it looks very exciting', commented Dr Jonathan Cooper of the MRC Centre for Neurodegeneration Research, Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London.            He said that the controls used in the study were not ideal, so the results are not as clear cut as they may seem, since the early stages of the disease see faster decline than late stage, though added that Dr Crystal’s most recent animal work looked exciting.           Children with the disease begin showing symptoms around age four, including impaired muscle coordination, involuntary twitching, and speech and developmental disorders.          A gradual decline in sight follows.          Affected children generally become wheelchair-bound by the ages of four to six years and eventually become bedridden.          Because the disease is fatal early in life, there are only about 200 cases of the disease in the world at a given time.  "
telegraph,19/04/2007 18:21,news,"Young boys about to undergo cancer treatment that will make them infertile are to have tissue stored so that one day they may be able to have their own children.         An experimental proposal to store testicular tissue, thaw it and then grow sperm in the test tube is being developed at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for boys who are under the age of 12 and are about to undergo chemotherapy or irradiation.           If the trial receives ethical approval, which could be given within a year, 10 boys annually will store sperm producing tissue for studies by the world’s leading figure in the field of sperm growth, Professor Ralph Brinster of the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.         Prof Brinster outlines the basic research that makes the proposal feasible today in the journal Science.         “We are currently writing a protocol that will hopefully allow us to begin testicular cryopreservation for prepubertal males at risk of infertility because of their cancer therapy,” said Dr Jill Ginsberg, one of the team at the Children’s Hospital.         “Our hope is to freeze some of this tissue for the patient’s future and then to give some of the tissue to Dr Brinster for further research.”             “We are excited because before this opportunity, prepubertal boys had no options,” said Dr Ginsberg, who is doing the work with Dr Thomas Kolon.          But she stressed it depends on Prof Brinster refining ways to grow sperm. “This is purely experimental and we cannot promise that their infertility will be prevented. We hope, however, to further the science.' Dr Ginsberg said.         Before treatment for cancer by chemotherapy or irradiation, a boy would undergo a testicular biopsy - removal of a plug of tissue - to recover stem cells, called spermatogonial stem cells, using a method pioneered by Prof Brinster in 1994.             The stem cells could be frozen for use in the laboratory decades later and Prof Brinster hopes to refine methods to persuade the stem cells to form sperm.         “We propose to take the early sperm cells and grow them up into mature sperm and use them for fertilisation,' Dr  Ginsberg said.          Prof Brinster added: “When a culture technique is developed for human spermatogonial stem cells, the cells could be expanded and reintroduced into the patient at a later date with the possibility of re-establishing spermatogenesis and fertility in the patient from his own cells.”           In other work, Dr  Kolon has identified genes involved in sperm maturation that are used less (under-expressed) in young men with infertility and a previous history of an undescended testis.          Further elucidation of the genes that trigger the stem cell maturation will help this population of cancer patients and others with infertility.     Although the proposal “is experimental, I believe families will sign up for this,” said Dr Ginsberg, referring to a recent survey where 60 per cent of parents in this position would take up the opportunity for their sons to have testicular tissue removed and stored.            Boys where the cancer may have spread to the testes would be excluded and,  to be safe, the removed tissue would be screened for cancer cells to minimise the risk of reintroducing cancer with the stored tissue, Dr Ginsberg added.          Prof Brinster has successfully transplanted sperm producing cells from rats into mice, so one other approach would be to use the stem cells to grow human sperm in rodents.          But the team intends to use the stored tissue to grow sperm in the laboratory, or reimplant stem cells, rather than implant into a rodent, since so called xenotransplantation raises issues to do with the spread of disease between species.           Other teams are also  storing testicular tissue, such as  one at the Christie Hospital in Manchester, which in 2002 reported that one man was to become a father after a ground-breaking operation where testicular tissue was taken from him and stored in liquid nitrogen before he underwent treatment for Hodgkin’s disease, a type of lymphatic cancer.            The Manchester team increased the proportion of sperm-producing cells in the tissue and two years later, with the cancer in remission, reimplanted it. Crucially, however, it was not possible, without unethical tests, to find out whether the operation was responsible for sperm production in his case, so the results were not conclusive.         Extending this work, Prof Brinster has also developed ways to alter the genes in sperm. But he says today in Science that “in humans, clinical and ethical limitations will be critically important,” a reference to how his peers frown on making genetic changes that are passed down generations because of the risk of unforseen effects.           Boys under 15 who have had treatment for a pelvic tumour, and thus may have had their fertility damaged by chemotherapy or irradiation,  number no more than around 30 annually in Britain, according to the Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford."
telegraph,4/7/2003 0:01,news,"    Researchers fear that doses of radiation could damage your grandchildren, says Roger Highfield      Imagine falling ill with cancer and discovering that the underlying cause could be traced back to something that happened to your grandfather or grandmother many decades ago.Evidence of this genetic time bomb, one that enables the effects of radiation or chemicals to be felt by future generations, has come from recent research. However, the effect has been best documented in mice and a race is now on to see if it also affects people, who have pretty much the same genes as rodents, only shuffled differently.If genetic changes from high doses of radiation, or the extremely toxic drugs used for chemotherapy, can render the human genetic code unstable and error-prone for generations to come, this could have profound implications, Dr Yuri Dubrova, of the University of Leicester, will tell the annual meeting of the European Environmental Mutagen Society in Aberdeen next month.A person who received a high dose of radiation decades ago could bequeath his descendants a higher cancer risk. The same goes for a patient who manages to have a family after chemotherapy. But Dr Dubrova stressed that the implications for humans are still somewhat speculative and it is too early to say whether regulations should take this effect into account.'I am uncomfortable with extrapolating our results,' he said. 'Radio-protection is a serious matter and the mouse data are not enough to change our perception. We are desperate for human data.''The nation's radiation watchdog, the National Radiological Protection Board, is also awaiting firmer evidence before taking action, said spokesman Dr Mike Clark, emphasising the differences between mouse and human genetics and the huge doses that have been used by Dr Dubrova - about 1,000 times that of a routine X-ray.However, he added that because the Leicester team is highly regarded, the finds are being taken seriously: Dr Dubrova is a government adviser, being a member of the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment, which has also discussed his work.It is well known that radiation can shake up the genome - genetic recipe - of a human being. The recipe is written in the chemical DNA - a code written in an alphabet of four chemical 'letters' - and radiation causes 'spelling mistakes' that can disrupt the genes that govern cell division, leading to cancer when cells multiply out of control.Earlier studies found no inherited mutations, or cancers, among human families that were exposed to high levels of radiation, such as those at Hiroshima, the target of the world's first atomic bomb, and at Chernobyl, site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986.But what Dr Dubrova has found is more subtle than radiation-induced spelling mistakes in the genome. His mice experiments reveal that large doses of radiation can make the genome more likely to suffer mutations, and that this propensity can be passed down the generations to affect people who have never been exposed.Rather than causing spelling mistakes, these doses seem to affect the 'eraser' used by cells in the body to rub out genetic errors. The result, so-called 'genomic instability', has been seen before in cancers and tumours. It is because of this instability that tumours can quickly adapt and change, for instance to cope with an attack by the body or even with drugs.While our understanding of cancer shows how this instability can affect genes in cells in the breast, stomach and other organs ('somatic cells'), Dr Dubrova has discovered genomic instability in the 'germ line', the genes contained in sperm and eggs, so that the instability can be passed to future generations.When male mice from three different strains were exposed to high levels of two kinds of radiation, neutrons and X-rays, the resulting three- to six-fold boost in mutation rate was passed on to their offspring, even when the offspring had not been exposed to the radiation - and the mother had not been irradiated. This higher mutation rate even persisted in the grandchildren of the mice exposed to the radiation in the three-generation study.'We were absolutely surprised,' Dr Dubrova said. 'When you go to the second generation you see the same level of instability that you see in the first generation of offspring.' Indeed, the genetic instability 'doesn't show any sign of decline''.To reveal this instability, his team studied DNA regions called minisatellites, regions of the mouse genetic code where short bits of DNA are repeated over and over, like a stutter. Being prone to mutation, minisatellites are good screening tools but they are not functioning genes and their purpose is unknown. Mutations in this 'junk DNA' may not be important.This has been used to write off the implications of his study, or at least suggest that they may be irrelevant for the regions of the genome that do contain genes. But Dr Dubrova's findings remain a concern for several reasons. First, 'junk DNA' is increasingly suspected of carrying out key functions, some making enzymes that ferry genes around, for example. There is also indirect evidence that the DNA that codes for genes is also affected by the instability, he said. And there is 'strong evidence' that DNA damage to germ line cells - sperm and eggs - could boost predisposition to cancer.Why was this effect missed in the children and grandchildren of the atomic bomb? The genetic variability between people is much greater than it is between the mice used in the experiment, he said. This variability could mask the inherited genetic changes caused by radiation, he said.Although three studies of men who worked at Sellafield showed an elevated incidence of leukaemia and stillbirths in their offspring, Dr Dubrova has yet to find convincing evidence of genomic instability in people. He conducted his most serious attempt to do this with colleagues in Kazakhstan and Finland. Together they studied people affected by Soviet atmospheric nuclear tests from the Forties until the early Sixties.The team found a link between exposure and mutations (though there was insufficient data to show whether this raised the local rate of cancer). They also found a decline in the rate of genetic mutations over three generations, underlining the value of the 1963 ban on atmospheric nuclear testing. But there was no evidence that radiation damage is heritable.That may not be a surprise: the doses may not have been high enough - certainly not comparable to that in the mice - to cause genomic instability. And he may have chosen the wrong DNA regions to study. Now Dr Dubrova wants to conduct further studies, for instance on cancer patients who suffer relapses after radiotherapy.He remains confident that his mice are telling us something about human biology. 'I don't think there is a great deal of difference between humans and mice, frankly. At a first glance we do differ. But looking closely at biology, DNA repair, damage and genome size, we are pretty similar.''If this effect is confirmed, there is a remaining mystery - how could a single egg or sperm carry a signal that makes the genome of children and grandchildren unstable? Dr Dubrova believes that it is caused by an 'epigenetic' mechanism, one that affects the way genes are used down the generations, rather than defects in genes themselves.An epigenetic mutation results from the chemical action of enzymes that decorate genes with methyl chemical groups. Methylation of a gene silences it. During cell division, this methylated DNA can be transmitted. Even though the gene is passed on, it remains silent.Radiation could be affecting the methylation of a DNA repair gene. This gene would normally code for one of the protein guardians of the genome, which is under constant threat from chemicals, radiation and the by-products of natural cell metabolism, highly reactive chemicals called free radicals. Once silenced by methylation, the gene would be unable to protect the fidelity of the genome - not just in that person but in his descendants, too."
telegraph,16/04/2003 00:01,news,"   Gene therapy and designer babies? We might have sequenced the human genome, but we are far from being able to perform miracles. Steve Jones reports  In my first term at university (less than 50 years ago but closer to that magic figure than I might prefer) I was directed to the library and told to find the most important scientific paper of the past decade. It was easy; one volume of the journal Nature, number 171, was uniquely battered, and two of its pages were darkened and torn by the impress of hundreds of fingers. In just a few paragraphs, the Watson and Crick paper brought the double helix to an astonished world and provided one of the icons of the 20th century.This week that icon has been polished with the finest rouge: the announcement that the genome has been sequenced with greater than 99.9 per cent accuracy brings to an end the greatest co-operative effort in biology. It also raises a host of questions: just what is a gene, what turns them on and off - and, endlessly, does the double helix alter our view of the meaning of life and what it is to be human? A glance over the past half century shows strange shifts in public attitudes, while a look to the future by some of the most eminent of today's geneticists reveals a certain scientific caution.I once met a policeman who did not know the difference between DNA and DOA (dead on arrival), but that was in the Sixties and perhaps he was having me on. Nowadays, everyone recognises the famous image, most people have some idea how it works, and many see the double helix as a threat as dangerous as its twin symbol, the mushroom cloud.The authors of the famous Nature paper that began it all were well aware of the importance of their work. They did not disguise the fact from their competitors (as his book The Double Helix shows, where Newton stood on the shoulders of giants, Watson preferred to stand on their toes). In this anniversary year, every scientist agrees; Rosalind Franklin, who took the crucial X-ray but missed its significance, was wrong but romantic, while Crick and Watson were right but repulsive. Their discovery marked the beginning of modern biology.Only one newspaper, the now extinct News Chronicle, mentioned it at the time ('Discovering how these chemical cards are shuffled and paired will keep the scientists busy for the next 50 years'). The media's failure mirrored that of the 19th-century president of the Linnean Society, who commented on Darwin's paper that his year had 'not been marked by any of those striking discoveries which at once revolutionise, so to speak, the department of science on which they bear'. In 1953, the world was much less stirred by the new genetics than it should have been.Now it is shaken. The grand agitation began in the 1970s. A glance at a BBC Horizon of 20 years ago catches the flavour. Slippery slopes abound as scientists play God to the sound of doom-laden music. Gene therapy, we were assured, was almost here - but how far should it go? In the film, two parents engineer a child to be artistic but outgoing (the ethics people balk at the ambition gene) as the presenter intones that 'we are the cruelest and most ruthless species that has ever walked the earth' (try telling that to a malaria parasite). The next step is to engineer out the gene for war and, failing that, science might, he says - in a nod to the dinner parties of the time - even insert an orange gene into a duck.All this was silly then and looks even sillier now. Gene therapy is still little more than a hope, we know no genes for art, and as for controlling warfare, a decent system of international law (or even compulsory castration) would be easier. Even so, science has moved on since that programme was made. The 1981 Horizon suggested it would take 6,000 scientists 40 years to sequence human DNA. That was too pessimistic; the job was done far faster and more cheaply than anyone expected. Cloning is here, human genes work in sheep and - if it was not so unfashionable - citrus-enhanced poultry could soon be on the shelves.Ethics, though, has stayed oddly unmoved. The most recent Horizon on the topic dealt with the late and lamented Dolly. It highlighted lots of good biology but, once again, felt impelled to make vague threats about the future ('Now, six pieces of Al's mother are frozen in a vat, somewhere in America!'). In the face of such relentless pessimism, it's worth reminding ourselves in this historic month for biology that the double helix has been bigger on promises than on delivery. We do not have reliable gene therapy or designer babies (whatever they might be) and human cloning has not happened. Last week's reported failure to clone a monkey suggests that, for purely technical reasons, it probably never will.Because it seems to be close to ancient questions about identity, about right and wrong, and about what it means to be human, many expect too much of genetics. In the end, though, it is just a science. What do the experts think about its future, half a century on? They must be sick of being asked. Physics has brought us the bomb and chemistry the ozone hole, but chemists and physicists do not spend all their time predicting, or even apologising. Undeterred, I asked three Nobel prize-winners about their hopes for the next half century. All were cautious; no designer babies or cancer cures, but a sober realisation, as knowledge increases, of how far we have to go.The beautiful simplicity of 1953 has become clouded. Genetics looks rather like physics in 1900, when many assumed that the science was done and dusted. The atom, the solar system and the universe were the same things on different scales and all that remained was to tidy up the details and to invent some better steam engines. Then came a discovery; certain elements glowed with definite colours when heated. That was the first step to quantum theory and, quite soon, the austere Newtonian edifice collapsed, to be replaced by a world of uncertainty (and, in the end, by the mushroom cloud).Genetics has not quite come to that, but it might. The first hint came from the shortage of genes - not a million, as the 1982 Horizon predicted, but only about 30,000; little more than in a simple plant. Worse, what once seemed like single genes can be cut and spliced to produce scores of products - but others can be knocked out altogether with no effect. Why, we know not; but it reminds us that we stand among questions and not answers.Molecular biology is anatomy plus dollars. Watson and Crick were the intellectual successors of the 16th-century Italian Vesalius, who began the great dissection just completed by the human genome project. The first heart transplant had to wait for 400 years from his day and even the circulation of the blood took a century. To understand the molecular machinery (let alone manipulate it) might not take as long - but it will not happen tomorrow.Even so, it is fun to speculate. Sir Paul Nurse, 2001's Nobelist, hopes that soon we will discover how each cell receives a complete set of genes when it is formed and - a more daring prediction - that we will even know how cells (which, unlike DNA, can reproduce without help) actually work. That's a real ambition, as it might help to understand cancer. Tim Hunt, who shared that year's award, hopes that 'omics', whether gene-, or proteo-, will disappear (thoughtless hype, he says), while Sydney Brenner, a pioneer of the helix (and winner of the 2002 prize) feels that by 2053 we might even understand how genes co-operate to build complex creatures from a simple chemical - and that we will then be in the era of synthetic biology, when animals will be made to order.Tim Hunt agrees. He hopes that one day there might be a computer program that will take any DNA sequence and calculate the size, shape and physiology of the creature involved. It would then, he says, be a short step to the resurrection of the Dodo.However, Dr Hunt is of the Vesalian school, for he predicts that this will take not 50 years but 1,000. With luck, orange-flavoured ducks, if not dodos, will have come home to roost before then, we will be used to what genetics can and cannot do, and the human race will find something different to worry about.n  n   Steve Jones is Professor of Genetics at University College London n "
telegraph,31/12/2001 00:01,news,"   TELEGRAPH specialist writers predict the major changes in health, science, law and education in 2002  Health: Surgery in Europe Nicole Martin writes: After a year of headlines bemoaning the state of the NHS, the next 12 months look set to refuel the debate over whether the Government will be able to revive Britain's ailing health service on a budget of £65 billion.Health professionals believe that the growing use of the private sector and foreign hospitals to end the misery of long NHS waiting lists will be one of the most important issues for NHS staff, patients and health unions next year.The Government pledged in its NHS Plan that by April 2002 no patient in need of treatment would have to wait longer than 15 months, and it is confident that this target will be met.Ministers hope that plans to cut waiting times will be helped by pilot schemes starting in the New Year under which hundreds of patients from English coastal counties will be offered treatment in France and Germany if they have been on a waiting list for more than six months.July may also see a confrontation between the health unions and the Government when thousands of heart patients who have been on waiting lists for six months will be able to opt for a private operation or even a hospital in mainland Europe. Patients waiting for routine operations such as cataracts, and hip or knee replacements will follow later.Andy Bell, of the King's Fund, the independent health research organisation, said: 'The problems are going to be around equity and quality. The Government has said it will make sure that any hospital abroad involved in the scheme has the same quality standards as the NHS. But clearly that has to be maintained.'The second issue is whether everyone has fair access to the private sector. The private sector only exists where there is a market from private health care and generally that is in more affluent areas of the country.'Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the British Medical Association, said the funding of the NHS would dominate headlines after the publication - by April - of Derek Wanless's final report on the financing of the health service.The debate will also be fuelled by a separate analysis by Adair Turner, the former head of the CBI. It is understood that his report to ministers will recommend sweeping changes to the way the health service is structured.Dr Bogle said: 'Everything else flows from the question of funding. Because while you have insufficient funding you get the development of the public/private partnership, which is a big issue for the unions, and which we hope will be only a short- to medium-term measure.'He said that the start of the scheme under which patients will be sent abroad could provoke damning reports on Britain's underfunded health service.'When patients first start going abroad there will be a flurry of headlines on the lines of, 'Ain't it a shame that we can't do the same here'. Patients will come back and recount what the hospitals and treatments were like, and the satisfaction they received. The comparisons may be very stark,' he said.This year will also see the implementation of new contracts for GPs and consultants. Anticipated disagreements over the contracts could bring the health service to its knees, with more than half of Britain's 36,000 family doctors saying they would quit the NHS unless a satisfactory deal was agreed by March 2002.Science: Stem cell research Roger Highfield, Science Editor, writes: Research on stem cells to repair an ailing or damaged body is top of the 'Best Bets for Hot News in 2002' announced in the journal Science.Stem cells are the parents of any cell type and offer huge potential in medicine. Although adult stem cells are one subject of study, scientists also want to conduct research on stem cells from embryos, whether cloned or IVF, which is controversial.Another hot field is proteomics, which complements efforts to read the genetic codes - genomes - of organisms. Next year, the genetic recipes of several more chromosomes - 1, 6, 9, 10, 13 and the X - should be completed by the Sanger Institute, near Cambridge. A single gene can encode several proteins and researchers face the more daunting challenge of understanding the proteome - all the proteins made in a cell. So called proteomics will include identifying and quantifying proteins and determining where they are, their variations, interactions, activities, and ultimately their function.Between Jan 9 and 11 a conference, The Future of Theoretical Physics and Cosmology, organised by the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council, will celebrate Prof Stephen Hawking's 60th birthday, which falls on Jan 8. Given that the Cambridge University professor first went to hospital for tests just after his 21st birthday, for a condition eventually identified as motor neurone disease, it is extraordinary that he is still alive.On Jan 18 astronomers will celebrate the dedication of the Gemini South telescope in Chile, which will complement Gemini North, a sister telescope in Hawaii, to provide a unique picture of the entire night sky.An assortment of Space Shuttle missions to service the Hubble Space Telescope and help build the International Space Station will take place. Galex, the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, is a Nasa mission to map the global history and probe the causes of star formation planned for launch in May. In July the Comet Nucleus Tour (Contour) mission will be launched to carry out fly-bys of three comets, the first in 2003.The centenary of a hero of British science who deserves to be better known falls in August. Paul Dirac, born on Aug 8 1902, gave the world anti-matter and was honoured with a Nobel prize in 1933.In September, Antarctic Waves will be unveiled at the British Association's annual science festival in Leicester. This is a new music composition tool using real Antarctic science, for example data from ice cores and penguins diving, to create compositions inspired by Antarctica.Scientists are anxiously awaiting the Government's Spending Review, to be reported in July. The Office of Science and Technology has done well in past reviews, but Save British Science believes other departments need boosts, notably the higher education funding councils and agricultural research at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.Government figures reveal that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, before it was transformed into Defra, spent £116 million on science, engineering and technology in 2000-01, the lowest ever. SBS believes the effects of this chronic underfunding on the handling of BSE and foot and mouth will be highlighted by the Royal Society's review of the epidemic.Another issue, says Peter Cotgreave of SBS, is the shortage of young people interested in science coming from the schools. 'There is an Education Bill before the Commons at the moment, but I cannot help feeling it looks like deck chairs on the Titanic.'Overall 2002 is expected to be warmer than usual. 2001 was the second warmest year since global temperature measurements began nearly 150 years ago, but the Meteorological Office expects next year to be even hotter. A forecasting technique developed at its Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research says the global surface temperature is expected to be 0.47C above the average for 1961-1990.There is about a 75 per cent probability that next year will be warmer than this year, but only about a 10 per cent likelihood that it will be as warm or warmer than the warmest year, 1998, which was 0.57C above the average.Law: Cut in trials by jury Joshua Rozenberg, Legal Editor, writes: The end of trial by jury in as many as two thirds of cases currently decided by juries in England and Wales could be signalled by the Government early in the New Year.Ministers are expected to give their support to the main proposals put forward by Lord Justice Auld, an appeal judge, in his recent review of the criminal courts.He recommended that cases in which the defendant was likely to receive up to two years' imprisonment should be tried by a district judge sitting with two lay magistrates instead of a more senior judge sitting with a jury.The Government has not yet announced its formal response to these proposals. However, it is already committed to restricting a defendant's right to choose jury trial in middle-ranking cases. David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, welcomed the idea of an intermediate tier of courts as 'a possible way forward'.A White Paper in the spring is expected to recommend more use of hearsay evidence and greater disclosure of a defendant's previous convictions. The Auld proposals will be implemented by a Bill to be announced in the Queen's Speech in November, though a draft of the Bill may be available earlier for consultation.Another significant change will come in the Government's forthcoming Extradition Bill. This will allow the new European-wide arrest warrant to be used in Britain from 2003 and will replace extradition arrangements between EU member states. In future, instead of starting lengthy court proceedings, a country wanting to prosecute someone in another EU state will send a Euro-warrant to the courts of that country.Once an arrest has been made, the local courts will have to decide whether the wanted person should be handed over for trial abroad. However, many of the existing extradition safeguards will no longer apply.Lawyers are expecting a rough ride from the Government in the wake of a report from the Office of Fair Trading last March on competition.Barristers, in particular, argue that many of their existing self-imposed restrictions support both competition and the public interest. However, lawyers realise that their natural unpopularity makes them a soft target.Coroners are also in line for major reform. A fundamental review of inquests will continue in 2002, though legislation is still some way off.Education: Further education funding John Clare, Education Editor, writes: Finding a way to make students pay more for their university education without further deterring applicants from working-class homes is the principal education challenge facing the Government in 2002.Not only are universities now severely under-funded but the Government has committed itself to ensuring that half the population under 30 are enrolled by 2010, which means doubling the number of students from skilled manual, semi-skilled and unskilled backgrounds.How, though, to meet the cost of their tuition, board and lodging and subsidised loans, which in real terms works out at more than £10,000 a year? And how to ensure that the education they get is worth having?Next on the agenda is the problem of how to recruit and retain enough teachers to meet our rising expectations of what schools should do. An economic recession would help, but the Government will concentrate on trying to make the profession more attractive or, at least, less unattractive.Measures will include reducing teachers' workload by recruiting more ancillary staff, and paying off the student debts of newly qualified teachers who carry on teaching in state schools for 10 years.Early in the year, the Education Act 2002 will come into being giving Estelle Morris, the Education Secretary, a battery of new powers (under the guise of making education law 'more flexible'), including the right to abolish the national curriculum at the stroke of a pen for pupils aged 14 to 16.The intention is not (alas) to introduce an alternative, vocationally-oriented curriculum but merely to make it possible for schools that feel sufficiently strongly about it to 'tailor their educational provision more closely to pupils' talents and aspirations'.In all other respects, the Government will remain as dictatorial and interventionist as it has been since 1997, forcing schools to do what it wants by doling out cash for approved purposes from the £1 billion Standards Fund that Miss Morris alone controls.In her spare time she will appoint new heads of Ofsted, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the Standards Unit, three of the most influential jobs in her gift. Those of an independent mind should probably not bother applying.Later in the year, her spin doctors will have to find a way of presenting the failure of 11-year-olds to hit two of the Government's most cherished targets as a triumph for its literacy and numeracy strategies.The targets were that the proportion reaching Level 4 in the national tests should be 80 per cent in English (achieved by 75 per cent this year) and 75 per cent in maths (71 per cent this year).However, standards - as measured by the results of national tests, GCSE and A-levels - will certainly continue their inexorable rise, though whether that reflects genuine improvement or merely grade inflation will continue to be hotly contested. In September, a mysterious new subject called 'citizenship education' will become compulsory in secondary schools."
telegraph,29/06/2007 00:01,news,"                                             From reading DNA to writing it                                                                        Audio: Roger Highfield on the significance of the breakthrough                                             Scientists could create the first new form of artificial life within months after a landmark breakthrough in which they turned one bacterium into another.                                        In a development that has triggered unease and excitement in equal measure, scientists in the US  took the whole genetic makeup - or genome - of a bacterial cell and transplanted it into a closely related species.          This then began to grow and multiply in the lab, turning into the first species in the process.            The team that carried out the first “species transplant” says it plans within months to do the same thing with a synthetic genome made from scratch in the laboratory.          If that  experiment  worked, it would mark the creation of a synthetic lifeform.           The scientists want to create new kinds of bacterium to make new types of bugs which can be used as green fuels to replace oil and coal, digest toxic waste or absorb carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.            But this pioneering research also triggers unease about the limits of science and the inevitable fears about “playing god,” as well as raising the spectre that this technology could one day be abused to create a new generation of bioweapons.         Producing living cells from synthetic genomes of lab-made DNA would require the ability to move and manipulate whole genomes.          To that end, a milestone was passed  today by a team led by Craig Venter, the first person to have his entire genetic makeup read, and which included the Nobel prizewinner Ham Smith.           Dr Venter said that, in the light of this success, the culmination of a decade’s work, he will be attempting the first  transplant of a lab-made genome to create the first artificial life “within months.”            Dr Venter said: “We would hope to have the first fuel from synthetic organisms certainly within the decade, possibly within half that time.”           The breakthrough occurred at the J Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland, the team reports today in the journal Science.          One of its editors called it “a landmark in biological engineering.”           Since the 1970s, scientists have moved genes - instructions to make proteins - between different organisms.          But this marks the first time that the entire instruction set, consisting of more than a million “letters” of DNA, has been transplanted, transforming one species of bacterium into another.          They are attempting to build a microbe with the minimal set of genes needed for life, with the goal of then adding other useful genes, such as ones for making biofuels.          It recently submitted broad patents for methods to create a synthetic genome from such lab-made DNA.           In anticipation, the team wanted to develop a way to move a complete genome into a living cell, chosing the simplest and smallest kind, a bacterium.           In all, of the millions of bacteria that they tried the transplant on, it only worked one time in every 150,000.           Dr Venter likened it to “changing a Macintosh computer into a PC by inserting a new piece of software” and stressed it would be more difficult in other kinds of cells, which have enzymes to snip the DNA of invaders.          But he said to achieve the feat, without adding anything more than naked DNA, “is a huge enabling step.”            “This is a significant and unexpected advance,” commented Robert Holt of the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, Vancouver, Canada.           “It’s a necessary step toward creating artificial life,” added microbiologist Fred Blattner of the University of Wisconsin, Madison.           Antoine Danchin of the Pasteur Institute, Paris, calls the experiment “an exceptional technical feat.”           But he told Science “many controls are missing.” And that has prevented Glass’s team, as acknowledged by Ham Smith, from truly understanding how the introduced DNA reprograms the host cell.            “We are one step closer to synthetic organisms,” said Markus Schmidt of the Organisation for International Dialogue, Vienna.          He said the experiment will drive discussions about the safety issues related to synthetic biology and the implications for society.           Dr Venter stressed that the work had been halted for some time for a  review to ensure it is ethical, though acknowledged concerns that synthetic biology could pave the way to new kinds of biowarfare."

Your view: Are men becoming obsolete?                                             Women could one day grow their own sperm, says a scientist who today claims to have turned bone marrow into early-stage sperm cells.                                                                  His team is now studying how to grow fully fledged sperm from bone marrow as a means to restore fertility in young men who have undergone cancer treatments. It could be five years before trials start.             Prof Karim Nayernia and his colleagues have completed similar experiments with female mice.             Within a few months, they expect to see if the method can be extended so that early-stage sperm can in principle be made from women, too.         Along with cloning, this could mark the second technique that makes men redundant.         The derivation of 'putative' early-stage sperm from four male volunteers is published today in the journal Reproduction: Gamete Biology by Prof Nayernia of the Northeast England Stem Cell Institute, Centre for Life, Newcastle upon Tyne.         Some experts urged caution about his claims, questioning the safety of using sperm derived from stem cells, and one was sceptical about the idea of women making sperm.         For the experiment, which was undertaken at Göttingen University, in Germany, Prof Nayernia's team took bone marrow from male volunteers and isolated a 'parent cell'. These stem cells have been found to grow into other tissues such as muscle.         In laboratory tests, they persuaded the stem cells to develop. The resulting cells look ordinary but genetic markers suggested that they were         partly-developed sperm cells, otherwise known as 'spermatogonial' stem cells.         In most men, spermatogonial cells eventually develop into mature sperm but this progression was not achieved in this experiment, said Prof Nayernia.         He said his work was backed by a study of mice by Prof Ronald Swerdloff at the University of California, Los Angeles, who reported in the American Journal of Pathology that it was possible to turn these stem cells into early sperm cells.         Prof Nayernia said: 'We're very excited about this discovery. Our next goal is to see if we can get the spermatogonial stem cells to progress to mature sperm.'         He is to ask for permission to carry out similar experiments with human bone marrow in Newcastle, where the Centre for Life unveiled the world's first cloned human embryos.         As for growing sperm from females, 'we have evidence that it is possible, in the mouse at least'. However, more work was required to confirm this.         Prof Nayernia is concerned that the Government could outlaw treatments based on such work. A White Paper argued that the use of artificial gametes - eggs and sperm - would 'raise profound new possibilities such as the possible creation of a child by combining the genetic material of two women'.         Prof Robin Lovell Badge, of the National Institute of Medical Research in Mill Hill, London, said there were fundamental reasons why female bone marrow could not be converted into sperm.         Men have a Y and an X chromosome (bundles of genes in cells), whereas women have two X chromosomes. Prof Lovell Badge said that a Y was essential for sperm while having two X chromosomes was 'incompatible with making sperm'.         'The only true defining feature of a germ cell is its ability to undergo meiosis - the form of cell division that leads to sperm or eggs having just one of each chromosome rather than a pair, as found in all other cells. The authors say they have not yet determined whether their cells can do this, but this is essential if they are to justify their claims.'         He said the paper contained 'several misleading statements', cited a 2006 paper that was 'questionable' and rested on the use of molecular markers to reveal the 'putative' sperm cells, which is a long way from the ultimate test of using sperm made this way to create an offspring.         Prof Harry Moore at the University of Sheffield said: 'We need to be very cautious. Unfortunately, these stem cell manipulations can lead to permanent genetic changes, which would make them unsafe to use.'         Josephine Quintavalle of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, CORE, said: 'How ironic that one of the few reproductive novelties the Government wants to ban is the very one that CORE could make a case for. But infertile men shouldn't get excited. There is far too much hype in this paper. As to growing sperm from women? As any A-level biology student would question, 'Where are they going to get the Y chromosome from?' '"
telegraph,10/4/2007 0:01,news,"            Stem cells have provided new leads, says Roger Highfield                  Scientists have found a potentially novel way to combat brain cancerwhich relies on old established drugs.          Each year, in Britain, there are nearly 2,500 new cases of brain cancerin men, and nearly 1,900 cases in women. About 300 children are alsodiagnosed with a brain tumour each year.          Now  it has emerged that chemicals that regulate brain cell signallingcan also prevent the growth of stem cells in the brain. This issignficant because  stem cells are considered a potentially importanttarget for the treatment of neurological diseases and brain tumours.          Dr. Peter Dirks, associate professor of Neurosurgery at University ofToronto, in collaboration with Prof Mike Tyers and Phedias Diamandisdescribe in the journal Nature Chemical Biology how they tested alibrary of drugs on the brain stem cells to understand growth signals.          They were surprised to find that a number of drugs in clinical use forbrain disorders which were thought to affect mature nerve cell circuitsalso prompt normal  brain stem cells to stop growing. They also showedactivity against brain tumour stem cells grown in the lab.           This discovery opens the door to the potential of new classes of drugsfor the development of brain cancer treatments, said Dr Dirks, and givesnew insight into how these compounds may affect normal brain function.If these drugs show promise in further laboratory studies, because theyare already in clinical use for other diseases, they could be possiblybe more rapidly deployed or 'fast tracked' for use in treating humanbrain cancer.           'We think our study has implications for understanding normal neuralstem cell biology in addition to identifying potential agents for use inhuman brain cancer,' Dr Dirks told The Daily Telegraph. 'As a number ofthe drugs have been in use for a variety of human diseases, and overmany years, we suggest that they may not only be acting on mature cellsin the nervous system, but may be also acting on neural stem cells.Obviously there is a great deal of work to do.'"
telegraph,18/03/2008 00:01,news,"            With a few genetic alterations, hens could soon be 'pharmed' to produce cancer-fighting drugs. Roger Highfield reports                  With Easter just days away, thoughts naturally turn to eggs of the chocolate kind. So here's a question: what's the most valuable egg in Britain?          Forget about the elaborate creations of master chocolatiers. The genetically modified brown eggs produced by a flock of designer hens at the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh are the biotechnological equivalent of a Fabergé.         Several generations of Isa Brown hens - a prolific egg-laying French cross between Rhode Island Red and Rhode Island White - have been bred from 'founder birds' that were genetically altered by Dr Helen Sang and her team to contain human genes.         Each gene provides the recipe for the production of a corresponding human protein. In the Roslin Institute hens the human protein is found only in their eggs, reducing the risk of harm to the hens themselves.         The egg proteins are rich in expensive drugs that can fight cancer and other diseases, with each egg containing enough medicine to treat a handful of patients each year.         With this technique, Dr Sang's team has created a potential anti-cancer antibody as well as the drug interferon, marking an important advance in 'pharming' - the use of farm animals for the production of pharmaceuticals.         Existing methods for making protein drugs, such as the monoclonal antibodies used to treat cancer and arthritis, are expensive and time-consuming.          Producing protein drugs in the eggs or milk of farm animals is potentially cheaper, faster and more efficient, but researchers have, until now, had only limited success in making pharming workable.         Because GM hens can each lay 300 eggs annually and can make faithful copies of human proteins, they could, within a few years, offer the prospect of mass-producing drugs that currently cost £10,000 a year per patient, at a fraction of today's cost.         To harvest drugs from eggs, Dr Sang's team worked with Oxford Biomedica, a pharmaceutical company that specialises in gene therapy.          They used a virus called equine infectious anaemia lentivirus, which infects horses, to insert the human genes into chicken embryos in newly laid eggs, by creating a chimera - a blend of GM and normal cells.         Crucially, some of the sperm cells in the resulting chimeric cockerels carried the new gene for the human protein, and passed on the implanted gene to their daughters.          These hens also contain the human gene in every cell of their bodies. The team controls precisely where the gene is used for protein production in the birds, to ensure that the potent biotech drugs do not affect the birds themselves.         The gene is tagged on to part of the hen's gene for ovalbumin, the major protein in the white part of its eggs.          Because this gene is only used in egg white, the protein drug does not harm the birds.         An online experiment by the Telegraph last year showed how egg white shrugs off bacteria and fungi to protect the precious drugs. After 50 days in our office, a bowl of egg white dried out, with no signs of decay, because of antimicrobials present in the white.         The Roslin team has hatched several drugs this way: miR24, a monoclonal antibody with potential for treating malignant melanoma; the antiviral drug human interferon b-1a; and beta interferon, used to treat multiple sclerosis.          The institute is also about to publish research showing that it has around 20 birds that can make even higher levels of alpha interferon, about a gram per litre of egg white, to treat hepatitis C.         Although there have also been attempts to make protein drugs in the milk of sheep, goats, cattle and rabbits, Dr Sang believes the conversion of hens' eggs into 'bioreactors' offers many advantages.          The chickens lay eggs after six months and are much cheaper to look after. A 5,000-strong flock could lay eggs containing up to 100 kilograms of human proteins annually.         Despite its huge potential, the project had a setback last November when Viragen Scotland, the company that bought the rights to commercialise the technology, closed following the insolvency of its parent company, Viragen Inc.         However, the team is pressing on with its plan to use chickens to make drugs.         The Roslin team is also working with Cambridge University to create a GM 'superchicken' that is resistant to the avian flu virus.         To interfere with the multiplication of the virus, including the lethal H5N1 strain, one piece of implanted DNA would allow the chicken to manufacture an antiviral protein and short versions of another genetic material, RNA, to block key viral genes.         It is an exciting development for pharming, an industry that Britain helped to pioneer by inserting human genes into animals such as sheep so that they could be turned into living drug factories.          Tracy, a Scottish Blackface born at the Roslin Institute in 1990, was probably the most famous sheep in the world until the birth there of Dolly the cloned sheep.          Tracy's milk was rich in the human protein AAT, used to treat cystic fibrosis and emphysema. But, despite the support of Sir Ian Wilmut, who led the team that cloned Dolly, the manufacture failed to materialise as quickly as expected.         The first medicine produced from genetically modified animals (goats, in this case) was developed by GTC Biotherapeutics, an American company.          GTC purifies a protein with anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory properties, which is secreted into the milk of 240 GM goats - a potentially safer alternative to proteins extracted from human blood products."
telegraph,9/3/2005 0:01,news,"A British gene therapy trial is to be reviewed after three boys developed leukaemia in a similar French trial. One of the boys died.          In the French trial, 11 boys received gene therapy for a life-threatening immune disorder, severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), freeing them from the need to live in sterile bubbles.          But almost three years after the treatment, white blood cells (called T cells) of the two youngest patients began proliferating abnormally, as they would in the blood cancer leukaemia.          The trial by Prof Alain Fischer, of the Necker-Enfants Malades clinic in Paris, was stopped as a result. One of the children died last year and a third has since developed leukaemia. It marks another setback for gene therapy, which offers hope of new treatments for the 4,000 hereditary diseases caused by a defect in a single gene. The therapy uses a virus as a 'vector' to introduce a corrected version of the damaged gene.          A similar approach was used to treat boys in Britain by Prof Adrian Thrasher and Dr Bobby Gaspar, of the Institute of Child Health in London, starting with Rhys Evans in 2002.          In the wake of the latest leukaemia, the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee is to carry out a safety review.          In Britain, seven children and one adult have been treated so far with gene therapy for X-SCID. None has shown any signs of leukaemia and all are fine.          The same approach has also been effective in treating another immune deficiency, called ADA deficiency, in both the institute and in Milan.          A spokesman for the Department of Health said: 'Without treatment, babies with X-SCID rarely survive beyond their first birthday.          'Until recently, the only cure for X-SCID was a bone marrow transplant but this can only be done using a donor of the same or similar tissue type as the patient.          'For children with no donor, gene therapy offers an alternative treatment.'          The Gene Therapy Advisory Committee and the Committee on Safety of Medicines will meet this month to review all X-SCID studies data.          Prof Fischer said yesterday the two surviving boys who developed leukaemia 'are doing well, one being now off treatment with the persistent benefit of gene therapy'."
telegraph,10/9/2007 17:00,news,"A British team plans to grow human teeth in the lab from stem cells within the next five years.                                                      British Association Festival of Science: Full coverage                                              The stem cells, which are able to develop into other cell types, will come from milk teeth and could one day become an 'insurance policy' against tooth loss and decay by offering a patient the opportunity to grow their very own pearly whites.          The effort to find a more natural alternative to dentures, dental implants and bridges is being undertaken by Prof Paul Sharpe of King's College London who discussed the genetics of tooth growth at the British Association's festival in York.            His research explores the possibility of growing new teeth in the lab or inside the mouth as a replacement. 'Five years from now, we will know if in principle we can produce human teeth from cultured cells,' he said.          Milk teeth are an 'attractive source' of stem cells, he said, though he added it could take many more years to commercialise, even if the experiments are successful.          The team will initially target patients for whom conventional implants do not work. 'Autologous cell therapy - using a patient's own cells - is colossally expensive,' he said.          His team is now working on obtaining ethical approval for the necessary experiments with human cells.          Prof Sharpe's team has been working with mice and their stem cells up until now. In earlier work, his team implanted a stem cell-derived mesenchymal cells - the cells which produce the soft tissues - and coating this pellet in epithelial tissue, again stem-cell derived, then implanting it, and allowing it to develop for 25-30 days.         His team has successfully grown a human tooth in a mouse entirely from cultured cells - they were of the right size, surrounded by new bone and connective tissue, and showed evidence of root formation.          There is already a milk tooth stem cell bank operated by BioEden's labs in Daresbury, Cheshire. There, the stem cells are extracted and then frozen until they are needed for general use: seen as a 'repair kit' for the body, stem cells are able to turn into more than 200 different cell types, from muscle to nerve cells, replacing the diseased, dead and worn out cells behind a range of conditions."
telegraph,6/12/2004 0:01,news,"A British woman who was left paralysed by a riding accident has regained some movement after taking part in a pioneering trial in which stem cells were transplanted from her nose into her spine.          Kim Gould, the first British patient to have the operation, can now crawl and has some sensation.                                         In May 1998, her horse stumbled at the final jump of a cross-country course and she was catapulted into the air. 'The way I landed just snapped my spine,' she said.          'When they come up to you and say you're never going to walk again, you just think: 'Oh, once I get out of hospital I'll be fine'. '          Then reality sank in. 'My whole way of life changed just completely.'           Now she has become one of the first patients to benefit from a pioneering trial by Dr Carlos Lima at the Egaz Moniz Hospital in Lisbon.          'If there's a chance that you could possibly be better than being stuck in a wheelchair, paralysed, I think you've got to take it,' she said.          Because nasal tissue contains stem cells, which last a lifetime and are able to regenerate nerve tissue, it offers a way to patch up a broken spine. 'Nature does most of the job, not us,' said Dr Lima, who has conducted the operation on 34 patients so far.                                        'All of our patients have some kind of recovery. We have no doubts about sensory recovery and some voluntary motor recovery,' said Dr Lima. 'They move and feel below the lesions as never before. And there is even some bladder and bowel control recovery.'          Kim is one of several spinal cord injury patients who will be featured in a forthcoming award winning Carlton Television/ITV programme, Miracle Cell, directed by Frank Simmonds and produced by Michael Chrisman, which will be broadcast in the new year. The team was the first to film these pioneering operations.          The first patient to have the operation three years ago is still improving, Dr Lima said. Some of his patients can now walk with braces or a walking frame.          Speaking from her home in the south of England yesterday, Kim Gould described the impressive progress that she has made since the operation in October last year.          At first she felt more sensation down her right side then a difference in her lower back and abdominal muscles. Now there is some movement in her hamstrings.           'It is very exciting,' she said. 'I can crawl around the floor. I am quite balanced now and I can actually lift each leg and move it forward.'           She added: 'What I have recovered in a year, after six years of no movement, is quite remarkable. It is quite amazing. Of course, my goal from the surgery would be to walk again and be as I was before, but I told him anything I didn't have before, any little bit, was gravy for me.'          She would also like to ride again, but her family are against it, she said.          Her case is all the more remarkable because the olfactory tissue used for the transplant can diminish over time, so patient age is important. Kim Gould, at 43, is the oldest patient to participate in the trial.           'She is a very special person,' said Dr Lima.          Another approach being studied by scientists is to create nerve stem cells from embryonic tissue. Pro-life groups reject the use of embryos and promote the use of adult tissue, as in this case. Dr Lima does not like the use of embryonic stem cells: 'I am opposed but not only for ethical reasons. Mother Nature made embryonic stem cells to proliferate and adult stem cells to replace and repair. To defy Mother Nature's laws is, at least, dangerous.'          But Mrs Gould said she believed that many people in her predicament would be prepared to try embryonic stem cells. She said of pro-life critics: 'They are not the ones stuck in the wheelchair. If they were, I am sure they would try anything.'          Dr Lima, who last saw Mrs Gould at the end of November during her physiotherapy session in Tocha, near Coimbra, said: 'She has electrophysiological evidence of voluntary movement of the muscle in the leg. That means that there is some control Kim is already having on the leg muscles.'          When Mrs Gould returns from her therapy in Portugal, her husband and son notice the improvements more than she does, she said.          'They say: 'We can see the difference in you. Just by your balance, the way you are sitting and what you do.' '          Mrs Gould's parents, Tony and Ann Bassett, were with her when she underwent the operation. 'Ever since she had the accident she's been looking into everything' said Ann Bassett. 'Tried everything, you know. And she was convinced that one day there would be something that would help her.'          'And it's here,' added her husband. 'We're still a bit apprehensive for her, but it should all go well and we're hoping it will.'          Dr Lima was inspired to develop the operation by work conducted in the late 1970s by Pasquale Graziadei, from Florida State University, and his wife Ariella Monti-Graziadei, who found that there is one part of the nervous system, a region in the nasal cavity concerned with the sense of smell, in which nerve fibres are in a state of continuous growth throughout adult life. 'It was when I was reading their discoveries that my mind was awakened with the idea and rationale for what we are doing now,' said Dr Lima.          In Britain, related work has been carried out by Prof Geoff Raisman, who is the first director of the new Spinal Repair Unit at University College London.          While working at the National Institute of Medical Research, Mill Hill, Prof Raisman's team transplanted cells from the nose into the injured spinal cord of laboratory rats and found that the cells had a remarkable capacity to integrate into the damaged pathways and lay a 'bridge' over the gap in the nerve fibres caused by injury.          'When we transplant the cells into that area of damage, the function comes back. You're seeing a glimpse through a doorway that has never been opened before.'          Prof Raisman said the transplanting of stem cells had vast potential. 'This is what will get people out of wheelchairs. This is what will make stroke patients get better. This is what will restore the optic nerve in blindness, and the auditory nerve in deafness. This will be revolutionary, if successful.'          He stressed that he doubted full recovery would be possible. 'But if a person can't even move their arms, to be able to throw a switch, to be able to manipulate a piece of machinery, to be able to drive a car - it's going to make an enormous difference to their way of life.'"
telegraph,18/12/2007 00:01,news,"A child undergoing   pioneering gene therapy for what has become known as 'baby in the bubble syndrome' has developed leukaemia.                                       Great Ormond Street Hospital has announced that the boy, who was born with no immune system, has developed the chronic bone marrow disease two years after successful treatment for X-SCID.              Affected children produce no lymphocytes and have no natural defence against infection, meaning they must be kept isolated from the outside world.             X-SCID affects only boys and is caused by a single faulty gene.            In the first trial of its kind in Britain, 10 babies with two types of potentially fatal immune system diseases were  given the treatment.         Medics in the UK knew that there was a risk of the children developing leukaemia as a result of the treatment, but the boy, who is three years old, has been the first to do so.          A trial in France of a similar therapy was stopped in 2002 after four of eleven children developed leukaemia.          Professor Adrian Thrasher and Professor Bobby Gaspar, consultant immunologists on the gene therapy programme, said in a statement: 'As with any medical treatment there are associated side-effects.          'The development of leukaemia is now a recognised side-effect in this study, though the risks are balanced by the severity of the condition and the lack of good alternative treatments for X-SCID.          'This first study is now closed to recruitment while safer improved formulations of the genetic medicine are being prepared for clinical trials next year at several centres including Great Ormond Street.'          They added: 'Every child matters.          'Families are counselled very carefully before taking part in these treatments.          'Gene therapy appears to offer a less intrusive treatment for those patients without a good bone marrow donor and, if we continue to make advances, may become the treatment of choice.'          He added: 'All patients are monitored carefully as part of their care plan.'          Affected children are likely to die within a year without a bone marrow transplant.         Gene therapy involves a working copy of the defective gene being placed in the child's bone marrow cells and these are then returned to the child.          Great Ormond Street has been working with the regulator, the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee (GTAC), since the discovery of the boy's condition at the end of last month.          Professor Martin Gore, GTAC chairman, said: 'My sympathy goes out to the child who has developed leukaemia following gene therapy for X-linked SCID and their family.          'I also feel for the nurses, doctors and researchers in the gene therapy team at GOSH who are utterly dedicated to helping children with serious life-threatening diseases.          'They are a highly regarded and professional group who have counselled families extensively about the risks of gene therapy, including the possibility of the development of leukaemia.          'I know that this child is in good hands and that colleagues at GOSH are doing everything possible to treat this child's leukaemia successfully.' "
dailymail,19/02/2015 16:46,sciencetech,"A major component of blood has been grown in the laboratory by scientists, bringing man-made blood transfusions a step closer.Biomedical engineers have for the first time produced functional blood platelets - the cells that cause clots to form - from human bone marrow grown in the laboratory.The achievement raises hopes that it will soon be possible to produce fully functional blood in a similar way.This would allow doctors to create tailor made blood transfusions for patients during surgery - helping to overcome blood donor shortages.Donated blood also carries risks as unless it matches the bloody type of the recipient it can be rejected, while it can also carry diseases like hepatitis and HIV, making it unusable.Scientists hope that by using a patient's stem cells, it should be possible to grow blood that is a perfect match.The new research demonstrates that it is possible to use human stem cells to grow bone marrow on a matrix of porous silk, which then create blood cells.The scientists from Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, and the University of Pavia in Italy were able to produce millions of human platelets.They believe these could be used to help treat emergency room patients with serious injuries by helping blood clots to form.They could also be used to help soldiers who are injured on the battlefield.Dr David Kaplan, chair of biomedical engineering at Tufts University who was a co-author of the study, said: 'The need for platelet production systems to treat patients with related diseases is significant.'The platelets can be generated on demand, avoiding the complications of storage problems, and in greater quantities and with better quality and control in terms of morphology and function.'The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Blood, used silk portien to build a bioreactor in which to generate the platelets.they used microtubes of spun silk, collagen and fibronectin that were surrounded by a silk sponge.The researchers then took bone marrow stem cells and embedded them on the silk along with cells that form the lining of blood vessels.Dr Kaplan said: 'Silk protein possesses a unique molecular structure that enables it to be modeled in a wide variety of forms, stiffnesses and characteristics that have been shown to affect platelet formation and release.'They then tested the resulting platelets that were formed from the bone marrow and found they were capable of aggregating and clotting just as they do in the human body.The scientists say that the platelets could be used to help study diseases that are caused by problems with platelets but they could also be used a way of helping heal wounds, ulcers and burns. Dr Alessandra Balduini, a biomedical engineer at Tufts University and the University of Paiva who led the work, said: 'There are many diseases where platelet production or function is impaired.'New insight into the formation of platelets would have a major impact on patients and healthcare.'In this tissue system, we can culture patient-derived megakaryocytes - the bone marrow cells that make platelets - and also endothelial cells, which are found in bone marrow and promote platelet production, to design patient-specific drug administration regimes.'Several research groups around the world have been able to grow red blood cells - the cells that carry oxygen around the body - from stem cells found in the umbilical cord.In 2010 pluripotent stem cells were used to generate red blood cells, also raising hopes that blood could be generated using DNA taken from adult skin cells.However, many researchers believe it could be another 10 to 15 years before it is possible to produce blood products from stem cells that can be used clinically.Writing in the Yonsei Medical Journal last year, Dr Hyun Ok Kim from the Yonsei University College of Medicine, said: 'Despite many advances in stem cell-derived hematopoiesis research, we are still in the beginning stages of making RBCs available, in both quantity and quality, for clinical use.'Bone marrow-derived stem cell differentiation of RBCs seems to be a physiologic and natural way of RBC procurement and would be an attractive option if functionality and production quantity can be optimized.'"
telegraph,24/08/2006 00:01,news,"A method of growing cells for research from human embryos without destroying a 'potential human life' has been developed by scientists.         The technique of plucking and growing a single cell from a human embryo without killing it could remove the most basic objection facing scientists trying to develop treatments for a range of conditions including diabetes and motor neuron disease. Religious and pro-life groups claim the current method of growing human embryonic stem cells is repugnant and unethical because it involves the destruction of embryos.          The technique, outlined by Advanced Cell Technology of Worcester, Massachusetts, in the journal Nature, will put pressure on the Bush administration to allow new lines of human embryonic stem cells to be grown.          British scientists and pro-life groups reacted cautiously, saying the announcement created the misleading impression that human embryos would no longer need to be sacrificed, when vast numbers that are surplus to IVF treatments, or which are shown to be genetically abnormal, would continue to be destroyed.          Josephine Quintavalle, of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: 'The intention may appear virtuous, aimed at protecting the life of the embryo, but in reality this is unlikely to happen.'          The current method of growing embryonic stem cells involves culturing a human embryo for five days, then removing cells from part called the inner cell mass, destroying the embryos. The new technique, called 'single-cell-derivation', relies on an existing method used to screen embryos for disease gene, called preimplantation genetic diagnosis, PGD, where cells are removed for genetic testing, leaving the developing embryo intact.          'Until now, embryonic stem cell research has been synonymous with the destruction of human embryos,' said Dr Robert Lanza, who led Irina Klimanskaya and Young Chung, Sandy Becker, and Shi-Jiang Lu at ACT. 'We have demonstrated, for the first time, that human embryonic stem cells can be generated without interfering with the embryo's potential for life. We hope that this method can be used to increase stem cell lines available for Federal funding.'          Dr Stephen Minger of Kings College, London, said the new technique would be seized on by pro-life groups as a way to avoid destroying embryos 'despite the fact that thousands of IVF embryos are discarded every year'.          He added: 'This work will add further fuel to the biopolitical debate about embryo research.'          Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, of the MRC National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, said it is 'a clever trick' but did not feel it marked much of an advance. 'The success rates were low, as only two per cent of cells isolated from the embryos gave rise to embryonic stem cell lines - in other words, at this rate it would only work for 1 in 50 embryos. I am also unconvinced by the ethical arguments. Spare IVF embryos used to derive embryonic stem cell lines would have been destroyed anyway,' he said."
telegraph,16/02/2010 07:00,news,"A new study has raised doubts about the effectiveness of 'ethical' all-purpose stem cells for use in research and treatments.Embryonic stem cells have the power to develop into any of the 220 cell types   that make up the different tissues of the human body, but they are mired in   controversy because they must be extracted from aborted foetuses. However, recent advances have made it possible to 'reprogram'   ordinary skin cells, giving them the properties of embryonic stem cells. These cells, known as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, are seen by many   experts and pro-life groups as a potential solution to the problem of having   to destroy human embryos. But new brain research just published suggests that iPS cells still have   serious shortcomings not shared by 'real' embryonic stem cells. Scientists compared the ability of induced cells and embryonic stem cells to   transform into immature nerve cells – a key process for any future treatment   of brain diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. They found that the iPS cells differentiated less efficiently and less   faithfully. Professor Su-Chun Zhang, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of   Medicine in the US, who led the study, said: 'Embryonic stem cells can   pretty much be predicted. Induced cells cannot. That means that at this   point there is still some work to be done to generate ideal induced   pluripotent stem cells for application.' The scientists used different methods to coax five human embryonic stem cell   lines and 12 iPS cell lines to start down the path of development to   becoming neurons. The results, published today in the journal Proceedings of the National   Academy of Sciences, suggest that unknown factors may undermine their   usefulness both as laboratory research tools and potential treatments. To their surprise, the scientists found that whether or not iPS cells   differentiated successfully did not depend on the presence or absence of   genes used to create them. Some of the iPS cells tested by the researchers were made using techniques   that bypassed gene reprogramming.  'It tells us the techniques for generating induced pluripotent stem   cells are still not optimal,' said Prof Zhang. Nevertheless he believed the problems identified by his team were technical   hurdles that would ultimately be resolved.  'It appears to be a technical issue. Technical things can usually be   overcome,' he said. "
telegraph,19/03/2010 18:04,news,"A ten-year-old British boy has become the first child in the world to undergo a revolutionary windpipe transplant, it has been announced. The landmark operation involved injecting the scaffold of a windpipe, taken   from a dead donor, with stem cells from the boy before implanting it in his   throat. The stem cells were removed from the boy's bone marrow and were ready for use   just four hours later. The cells trigger regrowth to create a normal windpipe without any of the   risks of normal transplantation such as the organ being rejected by the   body. The operation took place at Great Ormond Street Hospital, in London, on Monday   and the boy is breathing by himself and able to speak normally. It is the first time a child has received an organ transplant created with   stem cells and the second time that surgeons have injected the stem cells   immediately before implanting the windpipe. In a previous operation the   cells were allowed to grow onto the windpipe in the laboratory for some   months before the organ was implanted. The advancement means that more hospitals will be able to use the technique   and in future other organs can be replaced or regenerated in the same way. It is hoped using stem cells will eventually replace all transplant surgery. The boy, who has not been identified, will remain in hospital while the growth   of the cells is monitored. It is expected that the windpipe will be fully   formed within two weeks. In the meantime the organ is being supported by an   artificial scaffold that will dissolve. Professor Martin Birchall, head of translational regenerative medicine at   University College London, said: 'We believe it's a real milestone.  'It is the first time a child has received stem cell organ treatment,   and it's the longest airway that has ever been replaced (seven centimetres   long). 'I think the technique will allow not just highly specialised hospitals   to carry out stem cell organ transplants.  'Now we need to conduct more clinical trials to demonstrate that this   concept works. We'd like to move to other organs as well, particularly the   larynx and oesophagus.  'Importantly we need to think about how to make regenerative medicine a   key part of our health care.' The boy was born with a windpipe just one millimetre in diameter and was   unable to breathe by himself. He had one operation early in life to widen   the windpipe with a metal scaffold and this worked well for a year but then   it pierced a major blood vessel causing massive bleeding. Emergency surgery was carried out to fix the hole and put in a piece of   preserved donor windpipe as a patch and this worked well for ten years. But in November the metal scaffold again pierced the blood vessel and although   the bleeding was brought under control, surgeons were running out of viable   options to treat him. A team of specialists from University College London, Florence, in Italy and   Barcelona in Spain had conducted the first windpipe transplant using stem   cells in 2008 and developed that technique further for this case. Prof Elliott , director of the tracheal service at Great Ormond Street, said   'enormous numbers' of patients could benefit from this technique in future.   In many types of surgery pieces of tissue from animals or plastic   substitutes are used but that could all be replaced with the patient's own   stem cells. He said: 'If we could put into anybody, in any organ, a replacement piece   of tissue engineered from their own cells, it would reduce the risks of   surgery. The whole field of organ repair, of all kinds of surgery, is   suddenly improved.' Prof Birchall said: 'From here we can now go on an build all sorts of   other things. We don't think it will replace normal transplantation yet, it   will be many years before it replaces conventional transplantation. I would   be surprised if it happened in my professional lifetime but we are inching   towards that and it is going to accelerate.' "

I have never judged GMO foods. But just like 64 countries around the world, I support GMO labeling so you can decide on the foods for your family.'Another Oz alley, Joel Fuhrman, said the doctors weren't 'representative of the medical profession.''It's ugly,' he told Oz. 'Number one, they're not representative of the medical profession. Number two, it is not an attack just against you. It is an attack against all physicians, all health care professionals, all people who maybe don't take a standard party line.' Oz also included a statement from the BMJ, which he described as his harshest critic. A BMJ analysis of 40 random episodes of his show revealed that his recommendations were supported by evidence only 46 percent of the time.On Thursday, Oz shared a statement from the BMJ that said the authors of the study were 'disappointed that the overwhelming commentary seems to be that our study somehow proves that Dr Oz or The Doctors are quacks or charlatans or worse. 'Our data in no way supports these conclusions.'Responding to the criticism that he promotes 'quack treatments', Oz said his show's purpose was 'not to talk about medicine' but to discuss 'the good life.'He told NBC News that the Dr. Oz Show is actually 'not a medical show,' but that he had decided to no longer use 'inflammatory' words like 'miracle'. 'The purpose is not to throw at you the biggest articles published by doctors that week. Frankly it's not very much fun to listen to [those], either. It's to have a conversation with people who may be feeling the way you feel right now and maybe got better.'The Harvard-educated doctor joined the faculty at Columbia in 1993. He has been hosting his health and wellness talk show since 2009.   Dr Miller had led the campaign against Dr Oz. 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. I think I know the motivation at Columbia.'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country.'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.'He told CBS News that 'a person who endangers patients and is a menace to public health should not be on the faculty of a prestigious medical institution'.The nine other doctors from across the country included Dr Joel Tepper, a cancer researcher from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, and Dr Gilbert Ross of the American Council on Science and Health in New York City.The doctors sent the letter to Lee Goldman, the dean of Columbia's Faculties of Health Sciences and Medicine. The physicians accused Dr Oz of pushing 'miracle' weight-loss supplements with no scientific proof that they work.The doctors wrote that Oz, for years a world-class Columbia cardiothoracic surgeon, has 'misled and endangered' the public.The letter read: 'He has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain.'Thus, Dr Oz is guilty of either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgments about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments, or both.For more, visit Extra online.  The authors of the scathing communique took a particular issue with what they described as Oz's 'baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops.'CNN Money and the New York Times reported that some of the doctors opposing Oz have strong ties to the GMO food industry, namely the advocacy group American Council on Science and Health. Dr Miller, a researcher with a conservative think tank, has been a vocal proponent of genetically modified foods and has spoken out against mandatory labeling.Dr Oz insists that he is not opposed to GMOs on principle but wants them to be properly labelled so that educated consumers would know exactly what is in their food.'I do not claim that GMO foods are dangerous, but believe that they should be labeled like they are in most countries around the world,' he said in his statement Friday.  The New York Ivy League school responded Thursday, issuing a statement to The Associated Press saying only that the school 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.'Dr Oz first came to public attention as a frequent television guest of Oprah Winfrey.For the past five years, he's been the host of The Dr Oz Show.Last year, he appeared before a US Senate panel that accused him of endorsing products that were medically unsound.At the time, the doctor acknowledged some of the products he advised his viewers to use 'don't have the scientific muster to present as fact.'A show representative did not immediately return a call Thursday from the AP seeking comment.As vice chairman of Columbia's surgery department, Dr Oz still occasionally teaches, said Douglas Levy, spokesman for the Columbia University Medical Center.The controversy did not die down after his testimony. The company behind the'miracle' diet supplement in question later agreed to pay a $3.5 million settlement over false advertising. A study that purported to prove the product's weight-loss benefits turned out to be based on fraudulent data and was retracted. "
telegraph,14/04/2008 15:54,news,"An American company has warned that unscrupulous scientists could be harnessing a  new way of cloning human cells to create 'designer' babies.          The technique combines two existing technologies and may eventually be more efficient than current cloning methods.         Dr  Robert Lanza, chief scientific officer of  biotechnology company Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) near Boston, said groups were already using similar technology to develop new sources of parent cells, stem cells, to treat serious diseases such as Parkinson’s and stroke.         As for applying the method to human cloning: “It’s unethical and unsafe, but someone may be doing it today,” he said.         An American team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge,  has used the procedure to create baby  mice from the genetically altered skin cells of adult animals.           “In addition to the great therapeutic promise demonstrated by this technology, the same technology opens a whole new can of worms,” Dr Lanza tells the Independent.          “Cloning isn’t here now, but with this new technique we have the technology that might be able to actually produce a child. If this was applied to humans it would be enormously troublesome,” Dr Lanza tells the Telegraph.           “It raises the same issues as reproductive cloning and although the technology for reproductive cloning in humans doesn’t exist, with this breakthrough we now have a working technology whereby anyone, young or old, fertile or infertile, straight or gay can pass on their genes to a child by using just a few skin cells.”          The work relies on one technique pioneered in Britain by its latest medicine Nobel laureate, Sir Martin Evans, in the 1980s.            Sir Martin, who believes the significance of the new work has been hyped,  created embryo chimeras, which are embryos made up of a blend of cells from different embryos.           The new study relies on  one variant of this method in which the cells from one embryo contain an abnormal number of chromosomes, four sets instead of two.          As a result, the embryo that eventually develops is dominated by cells from the normal embryo.          The twist comes by combining this method with a new way to create embryo-like cells from other cells, such as skin cells.          These embryo like cells are blended with ones from a genetically abnormal embryo and then take over, so when an embryo results it is the clone of the skin cell donor.          However, Sir Martin comments: “This is not human work. This is work in animal models and things that are applied properly and ethical in animal models are totally improper and unethical and banned from human use.”          There is another variation on this method, developed by Sir Martin, in which the reprogrammed skin cells are  blended with those from a normal embryo, so the resulting chimera would end up with patches of tissue from each donor.          “So for instance if we had a few skin cells from Albert Einstein, or anyone else in the world, you could have a child that is say 10 per cent or 70 per cent Albert Einstein by just injecting a few of their cells into an embryo,” says Dr Lanza.          In this method, embryos can develop to make eggs from the skin cells, and other embryos can make sperm from the skin cells, a feat that has already been demonstrated by  the pioneer of the method, Prof Shinya Yamanaka  at Kyoto University, and an American team, led by Prof Rudolf Jaenisch of MIT.           However, it is unpredictable where blended cells end up in a chimera: rather than having Einstein cells in the brain, the chimera could end up with Einstein’s buttocks, for example.           In Britain, the Human Tissue and Embryos Bill going through  Parliament does not mention the Yamanaka technique, although experts  believe that the new law would make it illegal to incorporate the  reprogrammed adult cells into a human embryo because it involves genetic modification of cells that would become part of the embryo.            “At this point there are no laws or regulations for this kind of thing  and the bizarre thing is that the Catholic Church and other   traditional stem-cell opponents think this technology is great when in reality it could in the end become one of their biggest nightmares,”  Dr Lanza said.          “It is quite possible that the real legacy of this whole new programming technology is that it  could introduce the era of designer babies.”           However, Prof Peter Andrews of the University of Sheffield adds that was more likely to take place in the US than the UK.           'Noone bothered to talk much about this because we are clearly not going to do it in humans,” says Prof Andrews, adding much more work would have to be done to show that this method is safer or more efficient than the Dolly cloning method.           “Theoretically human chimeras could be made with embryonic stem cells  that we have had available for the past 10 years, but I don’t think anyone in  their right mind would want to do it anyway. there is no obvious medical reason.”          Prof Yamanaka himself has warned repeatedly that, although his method  avoids creating human embryos, it can lead to new ethical issues."

These particular cells, called olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs),   are known to influence the regrowth of olfactory nerves, which transport   smells to the brain and regenerate every 30 days. In experiments on rats and dogs, OECs had shown promise as a “bridge” that   could be used to reconnect severed nerves; previously paralysed animals   regained the ability to move. Various teams of scientists around the world   were racing to apply the technique in humans. But Fidyka’s surgeon in Poland   was forced to take a particularly daring approach; Fidyka’s mucus membrane,   ravaged by chronic allergic sinusitis, meant that OECs could not be   harvested from the nasal passages. Instead, the special cells – which are not stem cells but living adult cells –   were collected through brain surgery. Neurosurgeons at Wroclaw University   Hospital in Poland cut into Fidyka’s skull, extracted the left olfactory   bulb and cultured a ready supply of OECs. These cultured cells were then   transplanted into the spinal breach, along with strips of ankle nerves to   act as a scaffold along which the nerves could regrow. Within a year and a half, the effects of the pioneering operation were clear:   the fireman, who was also undergoing physiotherapy, was able partially to   move his lower limbs, could feel sensations in his legs, grew muscle on his   left thigh and recovered some bladder sensation and sexual function. From being struck down with a class A spinal injury – the most severe kind,   usually indicating lifelong paralysis – Fidyka had shuffled, albeit with the   help of a walking frame, along the spectrum to a class C injury, associated   with limited movement. And even though most of us would regard it as a fair   bargain, he didn’t lose his sense of smell. <noscript> </noscript>     var parentElm = document.getElementsByTagName('script'),    domOutput = document.createElement('div');    parentElm = parentElm[ parentElm.length-2 ];   if(Telegraphics.Modernizr.mobileonmobilesite){ domOutput.innerHTML = '<img src='http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/html/Years/2014/October/img/NoseMobile.png' style='margin:0 auto;display:block;' width='320' height='1030'> </img> <br/>'} else {    domOutput.innerHTML = '<img style='margin:0 auto;display:block;' src='http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/html/Years/2014/October/img/OperationOnline.png' width='460'> </img> <br/>';   }   parentElm.parentNode.insertBefore(domOutput, parentElm);  The operation was carried out in Poland, but has been hailed as a British   breakthrough because it was masterminded by Professor Geoffrey Raisman, from   the Spinal Repair Unit at University College London’s Institute for   Neurology. “I believe we stand on the threshold of a historic advance,” Prof   Raisman said yesterday. The research was also jointly funded by the UK Stem Cell Foundation and the   Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation. The NSIF is a British charity set up by   David Nicholls, whose son Daniel became paralysed after a swimming accident.   According to the Spinal Injuries Association, which has greeted the news   with “cautious optimism”, there are currently 40,000 people in the UK with a   spinal cord injury. Prof Raisman discovered OECs in 1985 and showed in 1997 that they could   reverse paralysis in rats. Now, according to Kevin Shakesheff, professor of   tissue engineering at Nottingham University, that persistence is paying off.   “This isn’t an overnight success story,” says Prof Shakesheff, who   collaborated with Prof Raisman in the early Nineties. “Geoff’s dedicated his   brilliant career to this over the past 20 years, and he has been looking at   clinical trials over the past decade. He knows more about OECs than anyone   in the world.”'Historic advance': Professor Geoffrey Raisman (BBC/PA)Even though the peripheral nervous system, in your extremities, can repair   itself – cutting your finger with a kitchen knife, for example, will not   usually lead to permanent damage – that is not true of the spinal cord. This   huge blind spot in the body’s repair system motivates many thousands of   scientists working in the field of tissue regeneration. It also inspires   fundraising: the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, launched after the   late Superman actor was paralysed in a horse-riding accident, has raised   more than $110 million. Not only does the research help the injured, but there are longer-term goals   in mind: the diseases of ageing, such as heart disease, cancer and   Parkinson’s, are largely the result of cell deterioration and cell death.   Being able to create healthy, transplantable replacement cells has an   obvious place in the future of medicine. Over the past decade, the hope of tissue repair, including nerve regeneration,   has largely been fuelled by the hype of stem cells. Stem cells fall into two   types: embryonic ones, which can be harvested from early embryos, with all   the attendant ethical quandaries; and adult stem cells, which can be   extracted from adult bone marrow and some body tissues. The key feature of stem cells is their potential to grow into particular cell   types; they have a potency that scientists have long dreamt of unlocking,   with embryonic stem cells regarded as the most versatile. That is why they   have been pursued eagerly as potential therapies for heart disease,   diabetes, Parkinson’s and spinal cord injury. In contrast, OECs are not stem cells but adult cells that have already   specialised into their final form. But it is exactly their final function –   somehow nurturing and encouraging the growth of nerve cells in the nasal   passages – that was so successfully exploited in this research. Prof   Shakesheff explains: “This operation has simply transplanted the repair   capacity from one bit of the body to another.”But we are a long way from a cure. Fidyka is the lucky one, a   proof-of-principle patient who is no longer confined to a wheelchair and is   instead able to drive and go hunting with friends. His recovery, an account   of which was published yesterday in the journal Cell Transplantation, might   be down to a number of factors. His spinal cord was cut relatively cleanly;   that might have made it easier for the growing nerve cells to bridge the 8mm   gap. Most patients, according to the Spinal Injuries Association, have more   complex injuries. It may be that the surgeon had a plentiful supply of OECs and managed to   insert them in just the right place. What is needed now is a set of   controlled trials to replicate results in a range of patients, to see if   this astonishing result holds true generally. But breakthroughs must begin somewhere. David Nicholls raised nearly a million   pounds for basic medical research that might help Daniel, his paralysed son.   Nicholls had been warned by his son’s consultant not to indulge in false   hope. Undeterred, he handed over the money he raised to Prof Raisman:   “Everyone said I was wasting my time, but what’s life without hope?” Prof Raisman, encouraged by his benefactor, did exactly what pioneering   scientists do: he followed the science to wherever it led, despite the   discouraging odds. He made a brutally simple scientific calculation: that   doctors could slice cells out of one part of the body, insert them into a   different part of the body, and those same cells might just carry out their   business as usual. It had worked in rats and in dogs; who was to say it   could not work in humans? In some ways, such medical breakthroughs are a matter of crude mechanics: we   are not inviolable organisms but merely bags of cells. But that a paralysed   man has regained the ability to walk through the redeployment of his own   olfactory cells is proof that the human body is even more remarkable and   surprising than we thought.

telegraph,11/1/2006 0:01,news,"An investigation into the work of the discredited South Korean doctor Hwang Woo-suk found further fabrications in his research, and concluded that his claim to have cloned human embryonic stem cells was false.                                        But the investigation panel from Seoul National University, which last month rejected other research by Dr Hwang, accepted that he did create the world's first cloned dog.          The false claims overshadowed his remarkable successes in cloning dogs and human cells, commented other scientists in the field.          The nine-member investigation panel said Dr Hwang's team had been successful in cloning human embryos and the 52-year-old scientist's success in cloning an Afghan hound named Snuppy had been confirmed by genetic tests. This was a remarkable feat given that the reproductive system of the dog is much less understood than that of sheep, cows and pigs, according to commentators.          But the data on stem cells derived from human cloned embryos was fabricated and it was a 'scandalous case' that merited 'a severe penalty', the panel said in its final report yesterday.           In 2004 Dr Hwang announced that he had created 30 cloned embryos using tissue and eggs donated by women. He also claimed that he had succeeded in producing a stem cell line for a potentially unlimited supply of spare part tissue for one of the women.           The investigators found that this line of stem cells, called NT-1, came from an egg that had divided spontaneously, by a process called parthenogenesis, not by cloning.          Last year, Dr Hwang claimed that he had created 11 patient-specific stem cell lines. Stem cells are master cells that have the potential to develop into any of the 200 plus cell types in the body.           Scientists believe they can be used to fight a range of diseases including cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's that can be hard to treat.           But the report said that Dr Hwang's team 'did not have any proof to show that cloned embryonic cells were ever created.'         The panel also found that Dr Hwang's team had used 2,061 human eggs for his research between November 2002 and last November, far more than the 242 and 185 eggs he originally said he had used. Dr Hwang has also been accused of forcing members of his research team to donate their eggs for his work.          Prof Miodrag Stojkovic, the deputy director of the Prince Felipe Research Centre, in Valencia, Spain, said this was particularly serious because the women who donated their eggs risked thrombosis and other life-threatening complications in one or two per cent of cases as a result of hormones used to stimulate egg production.          Prof Stojkovic, while working with colleagues at Newcastle University announced last May that they had cloned a human embryo, the first time that this had been done in the west. The Newcastle team had even followed some of the details of the Korean technique, he said.         Prof Ian Wilmut of Edinburgh University, who led the team that cloned Dolly the sheep and had planned to work with Dr Hwang in studies of motor neurone disease, added it was significant that Dr Hwang had cloned embryos to the blastocyst stage, a relatively advanced stage when they consist of between one to two hundred cells, including around 25 embryonic stem cells.         “This conclusion is very disappointing, particularly for the potential patients who had been led to expect new treatments and the women who donated the eggs.  Never the less, to my knowledge this is was the first time that cloned human embryos have reached this stage. an important encouragement for those of us planning to use this technique. Secondly the dog was real. Indirect evidence of successful cloning.”          Dr Hwang, who has admitted errors, but claims his work was sabotaged, was not available for comment yesterday.           South Korea's senior secretary for science, Park Ky-Young, a co-author of part of Hwang's research, stepped down following the panel's findings.          Their conclusions strip any possibility of rehabilitation for Dr Hwang, whose promise to make paralysed people walk had been engraved on a Korean postage stamp."
telegraph,11/11/2013 8:50,news,"Ancient DNA helps researchers unlock secrets of a cave bear and horse which roamed Earth hundreds of thousands of years ago.Scientists have managed to reconstruct the genome of giant animals which   roamed the world more than 780,000 years ago, using a new technique which   could boost our understanding of ancient man. Through DNA analysis researchers were able to create the genome - which   contains a mammal's hereditary information - of a huge cave bear and a large   horse that had been dead for hundreds of thousands of years. The breakthrough, reported by The   Sunday Times, came thanks to next-generation DNA sequencers which can   analyse tens of thousands of DNA fragments from buried remains to reveal how   they all fitted together when the animal was alive. Even those mammals which died in moderate climates could now have their   genomes reconstructed because research has suggested certain types of DNA   can survive outside of permafrost. Ludovic Orlando, professor of genetics at the Natural History Museum of   Denmark, led a team which managed to build the genome of a horse which lived   on the plains of Canada up to 780,000 years ago. His group found that the predecessor to today's horses, donkeys and zebras   lived between 4 and 4.5 million years ago - twice as long as experts had   believed. 'These techniques mean we can study evolutionary pathways and the   relationships between long-extinct creatures and their modern counterparts,'   said Prof Orlando. The breakthrough raises the prospect of reconstructing the DNA of giant beasts   which roamed Earth during the Pleistocene epoch, which ran from 2.6m to   11,700 years ago. Back then 20ft-long ground sloths could be found in the Americas as well as   sabre-toothed cats and 9ft beavers, while in Europe and Asia there were   giant rhinoceroses, cave lions, Irish elk and 10ft deer. Thousands of fossils from creatures like these have been collected but it is   only thanks to recent studies that scientists have realised there may be   enough DNA to recreate whole genomes. As well as Prof Orlando's work, a separate group of researchers were able to   reconstruct the genome of a giant bear which died in northern Spain some   400,000 years ago. The team overcame the fact that the remains were found in a warmer climate,   and therefore in a further state of decomposition than frozen remains, by   successfully relying on DNA produced by mitochondria. 'This shows DNA can survive for hundreds of thousands of years outside of   permafrost and opens the prospect of making more samples from this time   period accessible to genetic studies,' the academics wrote in a recent   paper. The genomes reconstructed are more than 10 times older than anything achieved   in the past and are lively to trigger a wave of new research in the field. With academics from across the world due to meet this week at the Royal   Society in London to discuss the developments in DNA mapping, some are   predicting ancient humans will be the next to enter the spotlight. 'Neanderthals are an obvious target because they were our nearest   relative,' said Erika Hagelberg, professor of evolutionary biology at   Oslo University in Norway who organised the Royal Society meeting. 'There are a lot of samples so we can now start looking at them in   detail, including how their genes have been passed down to modern humans,'   added Prof Hagelberg, who has more than half a dozen publications on ancient   DNA to his name and helped pioneer new techniques in the field in the 1980s. Some scientists are even predicting that the genome of Homo erectus,   pre-Neanderthal man, could be reconstructed as well as other mammals who   lived more than a million years ago. "
telegraph,3/2/2009 12:41,news,"Attempts to mix human and animal cells together to make hybrid embryos for medical research may be doomed to failure, new research suggests. Researchers who tried to use mouse, cow and rabbit eggs to make human clones said the effort failed to produce workable embryos, a blow described as 'very disappointing' by a leading British scientist. Although the human-animal hybrids looked normal under the microscope, they were genetically flawed, meaning they may be of little use to medicine or science. Sir Ian Wilmut, the British cloning pioneer who was involved in the 1996 creation of Dolly the sheep - described the findings  – as 'very disappointing'.The research team claimed that if the same results are repeated elsewhere, it would mean the heated debate over the ethics of human-animal hybrids over the past couple of years would have been a waste of time.Researchers want to create embryo clones as a source of unlimited valuable stem cells – the 'master cells' in an embryo that can turn into any other type of tissue, from heart muscle to brain cells.These stem cells could be used to treat a host of diseases – including heart problems, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.But because of the shortage of human egg donors, the hybrids were proposed as a way of creating large numbers of human embryo clones to harvest stem cells in bulk.However, the new study, published in the journal Cloning And Stem Cells, suggests animal-human clones are unlikely to succeed.Dr Robert Lanza from U.S. research firm Advanced Cell Technology inserted human DNA into the animal egg cells. However they did not activate and control the genes needed for stem cells.A spokesman from Advanced Cell Technology said: 'Without appropriate reprogramming, these data call into question the potential use of animal egg sources to generate patient specific stem cells.'Professor Wilmut said: 'This is very disappointing because it would mean that production of patient-specific stem cells by this means would be impracticable.'The first animal-human hybrids were created at Newcastle University in April last year.However, the embryos, created using egg cells from cows, survived for only three days at most.The creation of human-animal hybrid embryos was made legal under last year's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. Before then, they were not covered by a specific law.  "

The “biological” age of residents in noisy areas plagued by vandalism and crime is 12 years higher than their peers who reside in more peaceful places.  The researchers looked at genetic material called telomeres, the protective “caps” at the ends of DNA strands that control cells’ longevity.  The study of almost 3,000 Dutch people found that those living in the worst neighbourhoods had the shortest caps.  Telomeres get shorter each time a cell copies itself. Ultimately, if they become too short, the DNA begins to degrade and cells lose their function.   (Alamy)  Telomeres have been described as “the ageing clock in every cell”, a marker of true biological age.  Factors such as stress, smoking, obesity, poor sleep and nutrition all affect how quickly telomeres degrade, but this is the first time crime has been shown to play a role.  Prof Mijung Park, of the University of Pittsburgh, said: “Our team examined whether these environments have a direct impact on cellular health.  'We found that indeed, biological ageing processes could be influenced by socio-economic conditions.”  Telomeres get trimmed each time the cell divides because they are not fully copied by enzyme mechanisms and it is believed that ageing occurs when they become too short for DNA replication and cell division to proceed normally.   (Alamy)  Prof Park said that telomere shortening can be accelerated with exposure to biological or psychological stresses such as cancer, anxiety and depression.  Working with researchers from Amsterdam, her team examined telomere length in the white blood cells of 2,902 Dutch individuals participating in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety.  They determined which participants lived in good or poor neighbourhoods using measures of perceived disorder, fear of crime and noise.  • David Cameron 'wrong and counter-productive', says Muslim Council of Britain    • What happened in Charleston was terrorism. It's important that we say so   • Muslims must do more to repel Isil, says Cameron   “The differences in telomere length between the two groups were comparable to 12 years in chronological age,” Prof Park said.  “It is possible their cells are chronically activated in response to psychological and physiological stresses created by disadvantaged socio-economic, political and emotional circumstances.”  Their finding, published in PLoS One, comes after recent research which showed that Stratford in East London, home of the London Olympics and where West Ham Football Club is due to move next year, is the UK’s worst crime hotspot. It was described as a magnet for muggers, pickpockets and thieves. "

Tests could start on patients by the end of next year and the advance holds out the promise that one day 'blood farms' could provide a versatile source.         The research, which appears  in the journal Blood, was carried out  by Advanced Cell Technology, Worcester Massachusetts, and its collaborators at the Mayo Clinic and the University of Illinois, shows for the first time that the oxygen-carrying capacity of these blood cells is comparable to that of normal blood transfusions.          And it should be easier to ensure that blood created this way is free of contamination by disease agents, such as Aids and variant CJD.          'Limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life-threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss,' said Dr Robert Lanza,   Chief Scientific Officer at ACT, and senior author.          'Embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely, providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy.  We can currently generate 10 to 100 billion red blood cells from a single six-well plate of stem cells.'          He added that, if his company can obtain sufficient resources and depending on the outcome of safety studies, 'we could be in a position . . . to begin clinical trials by the end of next year.'         The breakthrough by a team that includes Dr Shi-Jiang Lu  raises the prospect of mass-producing supplies of the 'universal donor' blood type O-negative, which  can be safely transfused into any patient, whatever their blood group, he said.          The team achieved the feat by exposing the embryonic stem cells to a cocktail of factors, turning them into blood cell precursors and then the cells themselves.         Importantly, they expelled their nuclei, the structure in cells that holds dna, as happens in the body. 'We show that up to 65 per cent of the blood cells underwent multiple maturation events that resulted in the extrusion of the nucleus,' said Dr Lanza.         This also bolsters confidence that the cells would be safe to use because it means that the cells cannot divide and become cancerous.         The team is also working on the new embryo-free method to make stem cells from patients themselves, so called iPS cells, as well as conducting further tests in animals.              'Although more work is required before it can move into the clinic, it is clear from the rapid progress that stem cells could serve as an unlimited source of blood for transfusion in the future,' said Dr Lanza.          Dr George Daley, who works at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, commented that it is a 'very nice proof of principle.'         A spokeswoman from the American Red Cross told New Scientist the work is 'an important step towards the possibility of growing transfusible red blood cells in the laboratory'."

The research, showed that mice afflicted by stroke showed 'tangible therapeutic improvement' following transplantation and none developed tumours, which had been a major setback in prior transplants.         The team was led by Prof Stuart Lipton, who treats patients with these disorders. 'We found that we could create new nerve cells from stem cells, transplant them effectively and make a positive difference in the behaviour of the mice,' said Prof Lipton.         'These findings could potentially lead to new treatments for stroke and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.'         Prior to this research, creating nerve cells from embryonic cells in a reliable way had been problematic and sometimes cells would seed tumours.         Prof Lipton tackled these problems by inducing ES cells to make a protein called myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), which turns on specific genes which drive stem cells to develop into nerve cells.         'We need to have a reliable source of nerve cells that can be easily grown, differentiate in the way that we want them to and remain viable after transplantation,' said Prof Lipton.         'MEF2C helps this process first by turning on the genes that, when expressed, make stem cells into nerve cells. It then turns on other genes that keep those new nerve cells from dying.         'As a result, we were able to produce neuronal progenitor cells that differentiate into a virtually pure population of neurons and survive inside the brain.'         The next step was to show whether the transplanted 'progenitor' cells became nerve cells that integrated into the existing network of nerve cells in the brain.         Performing intricate electrical studies, the team showed that the new nerve cells, derived from the stem cells, could send and receive proper electrical signals to the rest of the brain. The team found that the mice that received the transplants showed significant behavioural improvements, although their performance did not reach that of control mice.         The British firm, ReNeuron, hopes to treat stroke patients with brain stem cells grown from cells isolated years ago from the brain of a foetus that had been aborted for medical reasons.         The company has found a way to mass-produce the foetal stem cells. By cloning and growing them in the laboratory and by inserting a special gene, to 'immortalise' them, it has been able reliably to turn these brain stem cells into specific cell types in the laboratory."
telegraph,1/6/2005 0:01,news,"British doctors have made a 'significant' breakthrough using patients' own stem cells to regrow their livers, raising the possibility of it replacing organ transplants in future.          Last year The Sunday Telegraph revealed that specialists had perfected a technique that could cure people with liver disease. Importantly it used the patients' own stem cells, rather than the controversial practice of cells harvested from aborted embryos.          Six weeks ago stem cells were extracted from the blood of the first five human volunteers, and injected into their livers. Early results show that inside the patients' livers, the cells have already started to grow.          Nagy Habib, the professor of liver services at Hammersmith Hospital, who is overseeing the project, said: 'The treatment is still experimental, but we hope that we have made a significant breakthrough.'          The initial experiment was to prove the technique worked using just a few stem cells, but already, there are signs of some liver function being restored.           The new treatment involves injecting the cells into the hepatic artery in the liver under local anaesthetic. Karl Hodgson, a 42-year-old reformed alcoholic and drug taker from Bournemouth, was one of the five patients treated by Prof Habib. He was given a place on the trial after his mother saw this newspaper's original article on the internet.          Stem cells retain the potential to turn into many different types of tissue. They can be obtained from blood, bone marrow, or more controversially from aborted embryos. But Prof Habib has proved that stem cell treatments can work without having to resort to foetal stem cells.          He is now planning a second phase of the trial this summer, which is designed to test the treatment's ability actually to reverse the disease.          Alison Rogers, the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said: 'Like many new technologies they take time, but stem cell technology represents a huge leap forward in treating many diseases.' "
telegraph,24/08/2011 19:00,news,"British doctors say there is now conclusive evidence that they have found a genetic cure for children born with severely compromised immune systems.They say gene therapy programmes developed at Great Ormond Street Hospital in   London are now proven to give children with 'boy in the bubble' sydrome, and   a related condition, near normal lives.Rhys Evans, now 10, was the first to be given the treatment, which involves   manipulating a single faulty gene, back in 2001. Since then another nine   British children with boy in the bubble syndrome have received it.In an academic paper published on Wednesday, doctors at the specialist   children's hospital said all 10 had benefited from it, enabling them to go   to school and socialise normally with other children.Half have been able to stop taking boosters of immunoglobins, antibodies which   help fight infections.Boy in the bubble syndrome is so called because some sufferers have to live in   a sealed sterile environment, although most do not. Officially known as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome   (X-SCID), it only affects boys. Writing in the journal Science Translational Medicine, the doctors also   said they had succeeded in using gene therapy on adenosine deaminase severe   combined immunodeficiency syndrome (ADA-SCID), which also affects girls.Four out of six children with ADA-SCID have clearly benefited, said the   researchers, paediatric immunologists at University College London who also   work at Great Ormond Street.Such severe immunity syndrome are rare, thought to affect up to one in 65,000   births, or roughly 10 a year in Britain. They are hereditory conditions   caused by faults to single genes.Gene therapy works by taking samples of bone marrow containing stem cells from   the child, inserting a working copy of the gene without the fault into the   bone marrow, and returning the mixture via a blood transfusion.The altered stem cells then replicate throughout the child's bone marrow,   allowing it to build a new immune system.Conventional therapy involves a bone marrow transplant from another person,   but sometimes a suitable match cannot be found.Prof Adrian Thrasher, who helped pioneer the approach, said: “These are   excellent results for our gene therapy programmes and the first time we have   been in a position to say we have found a cure for patients with these   conditions.  'It demonstrates that gene therapy for immune diseases is now mainstream, and   we hope this approach will benefit many more of our patients in the future.'Prof Bobby Gaspar said: 'We are delighted by the results of both of these   programmes.  'The success of the ADA-SCID programme has also saved the NHS millions of   pounds, as these children are able to stop receiving regular costly enzyme   replacement injections. 'Worldwide, 30 children have received gene therapy for ADA-SCID, none of whom   have died and 70 per cent of whom have seen a clear clinical benefit.'"
dailymail,1/3/2015 18:27,news,"Britons left wheelchair-bound by multiple sclerosis can walk, run and even dance again after being given a pioneering stem cell treatment.Doctors have described the recoveries as ‘miraculous’ and patients say they have been given their lives back.The treatment uses a person’s own stem cells – the body’s master cells – to fight the disease.If it fulfils its early promise, it could be the first therapy to not just slow the damage done by the condition but reverse it.Professor Basil Sharrack, of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, said: ‘Since we started treating patients some three years ago, some of the results we have seen have been miraculous.‘This is not a word I would use lightly but we have seen profound neurological improvements.’However, others cautioned that thorough research is needed to prove the patients were not just experiencing a temporary remission – something that does happen in MS.The neurological condition usually strikes people in their 20s and 30s and affects 2.5million people around the world, including 100,000 Britons.More common in women than men, it can cause blindness and paralysis, but current drugs are not suitable for all and there is no cure.The disease occurs when ‘friendly fire' from the body's immune system, destroys myelin, the fatty protective sheath around nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting the transmission of vital signals.The Sheffield treatment uses a person’s own stem cells to ‘reboot’ the immune system so that it stops attacking the body and brain.It begins with a sample of the patient’s blood being taken and their stem cells removed from it and stored.The patient is then given a high dose of chemotherapy to wipe out their faulty immune system.Finally, they are given their stem cells back. As master cells, they are able to form a new, healthy immune system.Amazingly, the treatment, known as autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, doesn’t just stop the disease in its tracks. It also seems to heal damage that has already been done.Sam Ramsey, 25, of Newark in Nottinghamshire, was left paralysed from the neck down by MS and breathed through a ventilator.Today, she can walk again and has passed her driving test and ordered a new car.She told the Sunday Times: ‘This treatment has given me my life back.’Holly Drewery, also 25, of Sheffield, has gone from being in a wheelchair to walking, running and dancing.In another case, a man who was blinded in one eye has almost normal vision again.And in Canada, a woman appears who had required 24-hour care, appears to be completely free of MS, more than a decade after being given a transplant of her own stem cells.Despite these dramatic improvements, the treatment is not suitable for all patients.A US trial on almost 150 patients, reported last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed it to help roughly half the time.There are also concerns about complications including potentially lethal infections.Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University College London, said that while the results are encouraging they are far from conclusive.This is because it isn’t clear whether the stem cells worked or if the patients are simply experiencing the remissions that occur naturally in many people with MS.Large-scale studies which compare hundreds of people given transplants with a similar number given traditional drugs will be needed to prove it works if it is to ever become widely used.The MS Society described the Sheffield work as ‘very encouraging’ and said it is eagerly awaiting the results of larger trials. "

Your view: Are men becoming obsolete?                                             Women could one day grow their own sperm, says a scientist who today claims to have turned bone marrow into early-stage sperm cells.         His team is now studying how to grow fully fledged sperm from bone marrow as a means to restore fertility in young men who have undergone cancer treatments. It could be five years before trials start.             Prof Karim Nayernia and his colleagues have completed similar experiments with female mice.             Within a few months, they expect to see if the method can be extended so that early-stage sperm can in principle be made from women, too.         Along with cloning, this could mark the second technique that makes men redundant.         The derivation of 'putative' early-stage sperm from four male volunteers is published today in the journal Reproduction: Gamete Biology by Prof Nayernia of the Northeast England Stem Cell Institute, Centre for Life, Newcastle upon Tyne.         Some experts urged caution about his claims, questioning the safety of using sperm derived from stem cells, and one was sceptical about the idea of women making sperm.         For the experiment, which was undertaken at Göttingen University, in Germany, Prof Nayernia's team took bone marrow from male volunteers and isolated a 'parent cell'. These stem cells have been found to grow into other tissues such as muscle.         In laboratory tests, they persuaded the stem cells to develop. The resulting cells look ordinary but genetic markers suggested that they were         partly-developed sperm cells, otherwise known as 'spermatogonial' stem cells.         In most men, spermatogonial cells eventually develop into mature sperm but this progression was not achieved in this experiment, said Prof Nayernia.         He said his work was backed by a study of mice by Prof Ronald Swerdloff at the University of California, Los Angeles, who reported in the American Journal of Pathology that it was possible to turn these stem cells into early sperm cells.         Prof Nayernia said: 'We're very excited about this discovery. Our next goal is to see if we can get the spermatogonial stem cells to progress to mature sperm.'         He is to ask for permission to carry out similar experiments with human bone marrow in Newcastle, where the Centre for Life unveiled the world's first cloned human embryos.         As for growing sperm from females, 'we have evidence that it is possible, in the mouse at least'. However, more work was required to confirm this.         Prof Nayernia is concerned that the Government could outlaw treatments based on such work. A White Paper argued that the use of artificial gametes - eggs and sperm - would 'raise profound new possibilities such as the possible creation of a child by combining the genetic material of two women'.         Prof Robin Lovell Badge, of the National Institute of Medical Research in Mill Hill, London, said there were fundamental reasons why female bone marrow could not be converted into sperm.         Men have a Y and an X chromosome (bundles of genes in cells), whereas women have two X chromosomes. Prof Lovell Badge said that a Y was essential for sperm while having two X chromosomes was 'incompatible with making sperm'.         'The only true defining feature of a germ cell is its ability to undergo meiosis - the form of cell division that leads to sperm or eggs having just one of each chromosome rather than a pair, as found in all other cells. The authors say they have not yet determined whether their cells can do this, but this is essential if they are to justify their claims.'         He said the paper contained 'several misleading statements', cited a 2006 paper that was 'questionable' and rested on the use of molecular markers to reveal the 'putative' sperm cells, which is a long way from the ultimate test of using sperm made this way to create an offspring.         Prof Harry Moore at the University of Sheffield said: 'We need to be very cautious. Unfortunately, these stem cell manipulations can lead to permanent genetic changes, which would make them unsafe to use.'         Josephine Quintavalle of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, CORE, said: 'How ironic that one of the few reproductive novelties the Government wants to ban is the very one that CORE could make a case for. But infertile men shouldn't get excited. There is far too much hype in this paper. As to growing sperm from women? As any A-level biology student would question, 'Where are they going to get the Y chromosome from?' '"

'20 years from now there will be therapies, instead of chemo, that will   be a much more targeted approach to treatment,” said Prof Jeremy Farrer,   head of the Wellcome Trust. “We will look back in 20 years time and the blockbuster chemotherapy drugs   that gave you all those nasty side effects will be a thing of the past and   we will think ‘gosh what an era that was’. “Understanding humanity’s genetic code is not only going to be fundamental to   the medicine of the future. It is essential part of medicine today. In rare   congenital disease, in cancer and in infections, genomic insights are   already transforming diagnosis and treatment.”Prof Farrer also predicted that genome sequencing to find the causes of the   disease will become standard within our lifetime. The first human genome was sequenced in 2003 following 13 years of work at a   cost of £2 billion. Now it takes around two days and costs just £1,000. A genome consists of a person’s 20,000 or so genes and the DNA in between.   Each genome consists of a code of 3 billion letters. Over the next four years, about 75,000 patients with cancer and rare diseases,   plus their close relatives, will have their whole genetic codes, or genomes,   sequenced. Cancer patients will have the DNA of both healthy and tumour cells mapped,   making up the 100,000 total. Scientists expect the project to be pivotal to the development of future   personalised treatments based on genetics, with the potential to   revolutionise medicine. A £78 million partnership between Genomics England, the body set up by the   Department of Health to oversee the project, and the Californian DNA   sequencing technology company Illumina was unveiled by Mr Cameron today. Illumina, originally 'spun out' by Cambridge University scientists,   will invest around £162 million into the project over its lifetime. By the end of next year that figure is expected to have risen to about 10,000. Strict confidentiality rules will be enforced and under normal circumstances,   patients will not be told of unforeseen surprises that might effect their   health - or insurance premiums. But helpful findings will be fed back to the doctors in charge of their   treatment. In return, those consenting to having their DNA sequenced must   agree to drug companies having access to the information as well as academic   scientists. One example of such a therapy that already exists is Herceptin, a drug   specifically designed for women with a type of breast cancer characterised   by over-activity of the Her2 gene. . Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said: 'The NHS is now set   to become one of the world's 'go-to' health services for the development of   innovative genomic tests and patient treatments.”"
telegraph,20/11/2003 00:01,finance,"Celltech, Britain's biggest biotechnology company, yesterday dealt a blow to hopes of a British biotech renaissance when it said it was halting early-stage target discovery and closing down its proteomics library.The company's shares responded positively to the announcement, up 12 to 362p, after falling dramatically last week when the company announced a renegotiation of its biggest deal, with Pfizer.Peter Allen, Celltech's finance director, said the company was finding it 'pretty straightforward to license-in targets' to turn into potential drugs, and that the targets its facility in Seattle was discovering had often already been patented by someone else. The company is now closing its target discovery facility in America, which it reckons will save £11.5m. It will invest the money it saves in research and development. Celltech chief executive Goran Ando said the change would be 'a more efficient use of resources'.'This will enable us to maximise the impact of our R&D budget by redeploying resources to accelerate development of our promising early target pipeline,' he said.The news represents a move away from the biotechnology developments that excited the market in 2000. Buzzwords like genomics and proteomics - the study of proteins produced in the cell -caused shares to rise sharply on discovery of very early stage targets.Mr Allen said there was now less interest in proteomics, as shown by the lack of a buyer for the proteomics service business that it acquired as part of Oxford Glycosciences earlier this year. He said there had been many expressions of interest in the business, but no one had ultimately come forward to buy it.The company has kept only 40 of the 200 scientists that it acquired as part of Oxford Glycosciences. Mr Allen said that despite the costs associated with the closure of the proteomics business, the acquisition will still have a neutral effect on cash and earnings this year, as previously stated.He said the OGS acquisition had provided the company with a Phase I development programme and six new oncology research programmes."
telegraph,30/09/2010 06:30,news,"Doctors have managed to save a woman's leg after it was broken in a hit-and-run crash, by repairing it with stem cells in a groundbreaking operation.Diane Stuttard had her lower left leg broken after being hit by a car while   she walked home after a night out in 2001. Both the tibia and fibula were shattered and she faced having the leg   amputated after 11 operations. However, she then contacted Anan Shetty, a leading orthopaedic surgeon, after   seeing a Sky News report about him using stem cells to save the leg   of a climber. During her operation, at the private Spire Alexandra Hospital in Chatham,   Kent, stem cells from her bone marrow were taken and mixed with a gel called   Surgifill, which trapped the cells against the fracture. Within days they   started to form healthy new bone, healing the break. Surgeons also lengthened her leg by cutting into a healthy section of bone,   injecting the stem cell mix and using an orthopaedic scaffold to gently pull   the bone apart at a rate of almost half an inch (1cm) a month. Although it is not the first time stem cells have been used in bone   reconstruction, it is the first time the combination of stem cells,   Surgifill and the leg lengthening technique has been used anywhere in the   world. She told Sky News: 'I was advised to have the leg amputated by the   surgeon in Leeds, but thankfully I said I wanted to wait until I had   exhausted all avenues. I'm glad I did because this stem cell technique has   come up and now it's my chance to get it right.'Mr Shetty said: 'I am confident the fracture will join up. We managed to   cut out all the dead bone and get into bleeding bone, which means that it is   healthy. We also managed to use stem cells that will stimulate the bone to   grow quicker.'The doctors and patient will have to wait 18 months before they can be sure   the leg has healed properly. "
telegraph,21/04/2010 15:00,news,"Drinking alcohol speeds up the ageing process and raises the risk of cancer, a study finds.Researchers have found that drinking damages part of the cells that are linked   to premature ageing and cancer. They discovered that it causes stress and inflammation to telomeres – the ends   of DNA strands that stop them unravelling much like the ends of shoelaces. As people age, telomere length shortens progressively and eventually they are   so damaged the cell dies. The study found alcohol accelerates this process. Since telomere shortening is thought to also increase cancer risk, the   researchers speculated that those with shorter telomeres due to heavy   alcohol consumption would have an increased risk of cancer. Andrea Baccarelli, the lead researcher at the University of Milan in Italy,   said: 'Heavy alcohol users tend to look haggard, and it is commonly   thought heavy drinking leads to premature ageing and earlier onset of   diseases of ageing.' The researchers looked at more than 250 volunteers some of whom drank more   than four alcoholic drinks per day. They were similar in age and other factors that might affect telomere length,   such as diet, physical exercise, work-related stress and environmental   exposures. Results showed that telomere length was dramatically shortened in those who   consumed heavy amounts of alcohol. In some telomere length was nearly half   as long as telomere length in the non-abusers. Results of the study were presented at the American Association for Cancer   Research's annual conference. "
telegraph,19/11/2007 22:01,news,"Evidence that a breakthrough has been achieved in gene therapy for serious brain diseases has come with the release of the hard evidence that it works in Parkinson's disease.          The world's first gene therapy for a brain disease brought about significant improvements in the mobility of Parkinson's sufferers. American doctors said it could also herald a landmark in the treatment of other neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's or epilepsy but there was a lingering doubt that the reports by a dozen patients of improvements of up to 65 per cent in mobility could be anecdotal or due to the placebo effect.          Today, Prof David Eidelberg of the of The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York, and colleagues report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences evidence that the brain chemistry of the patients has been altered by gene therapy, ending concerns that the evidence that it worked depended too much on what the patients said and not enough on objective measures. 'It is the first solid evidence of benefit from gene therapy. It is objective,' Prof Eidelberg told The Daily Telegraph.          Parkinson's affects about 120,000 people in Britain, with 10,000 new cases diagnosed every year. It robs sufferers of the ability to walk and even eat, causes long motionless periods known as 'freezing' as well as head and limb tremors. As the disease progresses, higher doses of drugs are required, leading to side-effects that include involuntary movements.          Sufferers include the former world boxing champion Muhammad Ali and the actor Michael J Fox.          The research team, from the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Centre and the New Jersey-based company Neurologix, used the gene therapy to fix some of the damage caused by the disease.         Parkinson's occurs when the brain cells - neurons - that release the messenger chemical known as dopamine die. Protein deposits also form in the brain, and levels of another messenger chemical called GABA - which calms overexcited brain cells - drop.          The study, begun in 2003, was carried out on 11 men and one woman with an average age of 58, who had all had severe Parkinson's for at least five years and for whom current therapies were no longer effective.          Prof Matthew During from Ohio State University grew copies of the human gene used in the therapy in bacteria from DNA isolated from a human sample and the gene multiplied with the bacteria for the treatment.          The gene was packaged in a virus and patients were given injections of billions of copies of the genetically altered viruses into part of the brain called the subthalamic nucleus. To show that the treatment was truly having an effect, and the gene was being inserted into brain cells, the doctors injected only on one side of their brains, leaving the untreated side of the brain as a control.          Scans to reveal the use of glucose in the brain to signal how active each area is, now show that changes were only significant on the treated side of the brain, said Prof Eidelberg. 'We have been able to identify very distinct metabolism in the brain of Parkinson's patients.'          Other treatments for Parkinson's include dopamine and deep brain stimulation with ultrafine electrodes 'reduced significiantly' these activities.          Gene therapy also produced a 'highly significant' reduction in this network at six and 12 months, said Prof Eidelberg. 'The unoperated side showed an increase and the treated sign showed a decline. And the amount of correction we saw on the scans correlated with the observed clinical improvement.'          The researchers are about to start a larger Phase 2 study in Parkinson's disease this year and a preliminary trial with epilepsy sufferers. The success of this trial lays the foundation for the use of gene therapy against neurological diseases generally, notably Alzheimer's and epilepsy.          Nathan Klein, 59, the first to undergo the pioneering treatment told The Daily Telegraph that before the gene therapy, he had been 'in a state that nobody could survive'.          Four years ago, Klein had a shuffling gait and tremors that could not be quashed by conventional treatments. Then Dr Michael Kaplitt inserted through the hole in his skull a fine eight inch hypodermic and injected 3.5 billion genetically altered viruses to help correct the chemical imbalance that sparks Parkinson's.          The television producer told The Daily Telegraph that he was conscious during the five hour operation and 'told them dirty jokes.'          'Nothing happened for the first week. And then nothing happened for the second week. And then a month, and two months, and then at three months I thought I was a little better, nothing much,' Klein said. 'It was like watching grass grow. But about six months later, I started feeling a lot better.'          'This is an encouraging initial study with this technique,' commented Prof Carl Clarke of the University of Birmingham. 'However, much larger and longer clinical trials will be required before we can conclude that this treatment is both effective and safe. We are well aware of the large placebo effect in Parkinson's disease clinical trials.          'We have also seen encouraging results in small surgery trials with foetal nigral transplants and glial-derived nerve growth factor (GDNF) reversed in larger trials leading to further development being abandoned. It will take clinical trials over the next 5 to 10 years to ensure that this technique works and that it does not harm patients. It will take even longer to establish that it is cost-effective for the NHS to fund.'"
telegraph,17/04/2014 20:04,news,"For the first time scientists have turned the skin cells of a pensioner into stem cells, which can grow into any type of tissue in the bodyHuman cloning has been used to create stem cells for adults for the first time   in a breakthrough which could lead to tissue and organs being regrown. Using the cloning technique which produced Dolly the sheep in 1996,   researchers were able for the first time to turn adult human skin cells into   stem cells, which can grow into any type of tissue in the body. Remarkably they even managed to do it with the cells of a pensioner - a   75-year-old man - raising the prospect that body parts could be regenerated   in old age. The breakthrough could lead to new tissue-transplant operations for a range of   debilitating disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis,   heart disease and spinal cord injuries. Last year a team managed to create stem cells from the skin cells of babies   but it was unclear whether it would work in adults because cells mutate with   age. However a team at the Research Institute for Stem Cell Research at CHA Health   Systems in Los Angeles and the University of Seoul said they had achieved   the same result with two men, one aged 35 and one 75. 'The proportion of diseases you can treat with lab-made tissue increases   with age. So if you can’t do this with adult cells it is of limited value,”   said Robert Lanza, co-author of the research which published in the journal   Cell Stem Cell The technique works by removing the nucleus from an unfertilised egg and   replacing it with the nucleus of a skin cell. An electric shock causes the   cells to begin dividing until they form a ‘blastocyst’ – a small ball of a   few hundred cells. In IVF it is a blastocyst which is implanted into the womb, but with this   technique the cells would be harvested to be used to create other organs or   tissues. However, the breakthrough is likely to reignite the debate about the ethics of   creating human embryos for medical purposes and the possible use of the same   technique to produce cloned babies – which is illegal in Britain. Although the embryos created may not give rise to a human clone even if   implanted in a womb, the prospect is now scientifically closer. However scientists have been trying for years to clone monkeys and have yet to   succeed. Dr Lanza admitted that without strong regulations, the early embryos produced   in therapeutic cloning “could also be used for human reproductive cloning,   although this would be unsafe and grossly unethical”. However, he said it was important for the future of regenerative medicine that   research into therapeutic cloning should continue. Reproductive biologist Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health and Science   University, who developed the technique last year said: 'The advance   here is showing that (nuclear transfer) looks like it will work with people   of all ages. 'I'm happy to hear that our experiment was verified and shown to be   genuine.”However the high cost of creating stem cells means that at present 'only   a few wealthy old men could do it,' said Lanza. A big barrier to producing patient-specific stem-cell lines for tens of   millions of people this way is that few women want to donate eggs, a   sometimes painful process. But many people have genetically similar immune systems, Lanza said, so just '100   human embryonic stem cell lines would generate a complete match for over   half the American population. "
telegraph,4/10/2002 0:01,news,"Gene therapy trials are to continue in Britain even though a French child undergoing the same experimental treatment has developed leukaemia.The Government's gene therapy watchdog said the benefits of the treatment for 'bubble babies' born without immune systems outweighed the risks. However, it called for tighter monitoring of two similar experiments at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London.French authorities halted their gene therapy tests after a boy, apparently cured of the potentially fatal disease, went on to develop leukaemia.Prof Norman Nevin, chairman of the UK Gene Therapy Advisory Committee (GTAC), said the treatment had been used on 15 patients in Britain and France. If they had been given conventional treatments, five would probably have died by now.'We accepted that there was a safety risk,' he said. 'However, because the treatment options are so limited for these children, we have decided that approval should continue.'The unnamed child was one of 11 boys suffering from inherited severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, or X-SCID, being treated at the Necker hospital in Paris.The condition is caused by a single gene mutation on the X chromosome in bone marrow cells. Babies with the condition are unable to fight infections and must live in sterile environments. Without treatment, most die before their first birthday.Until recently the only cure was a bone marrow transplant, which worked well only if donors were close family members. Gene therapy offered a safer alternative: a way of repairing the baby's faulty genes by inserting a healthy copy of the mutated gene into the baby's bone marrow cells. However, there is no way of controlling where the healthy gene is inserted.Prof Nevin said: 'Tests showed that the retrovirus appears to have been inserted close to a gene that has been implicated with leukaemia. All the evidence suggests that the retrovirus has contributed to the leukaemia.'However, other factors may have been involved in the child's condition, he added.In Britain there are 14 gene therapy trials involving 160 patients. In April, doctors at Great Ormond Street reported a major success after treating 18-month-old Rhys Evans using gene therapy.His mother, Marie Evans, supported the decision to continue the trials. 'When Rhys was admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital, he was a very sick little boy who could barely lift his head,' she said.'Gene therapy was our only real hope. It has saved Rhys's life - he is a happy, healthy toddler now. We've just celebrated his second birthday, which is a miracle.'Last year, we thought he may not even reach his first. I would not hesitate to make exactly the same choice again.'"

The group’s charitable arm will provide Croydon hospitals with staff,   technology and the specialist equipment to collect blood rich in stem cells   from umbilical cords of newborns. Expectant parents will have the option of donating the stem cells to the   Government’s public bank, or storing them with Precious Cell’s private bank,   at a charge, for their own use. Precious Cells will not charge the NHS for its services, and will share the   private storage profits. It said it expected the deal to generate about £2m   for NHS Trust Croydon over five years. The deal is the first of its kind for the NHS, and 15 more trusts are holding   “firm” talks with Precious Cells, the company said. The partnership could   “significantly increase” the number of stem cells available for transplants   and scientific research in the UK. Currently, the levels of cord blood donations in Britain are a fraction of   those in the US and Australia, and lower than in most European countries. The company is aiming to broaden its reach to 90 NHS trusts, adding that such   widespread partnerships could generate a £180m windfall for the health   service. Dr Husein K. Salem, chief executive of Precious Cells, said the initiative   aimed to tackle the UK’s laggard position in terms of investment in cord   blood stem cell collection and banking. Stem cell treatment has become increasingly common and is now used for   diseases ranging from diabetes to Parkinson’s. It is estimated that one in   five people will use the regenerative cells to treat a condition or for   diagnostics.

telegraph,23/07/2001 00:00,comment,"JUST who is President George W Bush? That is a question confronting Pope John Paul this morning as he meets the 55-year-old Texan at Castel Gandolfo, the papal summer residence in the hills south of Rome.The Pope will have heard about Mr Bush's homely humour, his winning personal manner and the strongly religious basis of his philosophy of 'compassionate conservatism'. He will know, too, that he bluntly rejects much conventional liberal wisdom, and that, like president Ronald Reagan, he will always be sneered at as stupid.Mr Bush, however, has yet to reveal his inner core. Curiously, in seeking his own answer to the riddle, the Pope might even help some in the White House find out what the President is made of.The President's papal visit comes after weeks of public agonising about whether to permit federal government funding for research on stem cells taken from embryos created during fertilisation treatments. Such research, it is said, offers the potential for breakthroughs on treatments for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's and spinal injuries.During his election battle, Mr Bush was unequivocally opposed to such funding, on the basis that the embryos destroyed as a result are human beings no different from you or me a few days after conception. This was a stance shared by the Pope and the powerful anti-abortion movement in the United States.But, facing conflicting advice from his staff and behind-the-scenes lobbying from pharmaceutical companies, Mr Bush has delayed announcing a decision. Sensing weakness, a huge pro-research campaign is being waged by leading scientists, doctors and the predominantly anti-conservative media.As if the moral problems were not enough to grapple with, major political factors now weigh in the equation. While in Britain the House of Commons backed research in a free vote last year, in America embryonic stem cells are a hotly disputed political issue.Karl Rove, the White House's resident Machiavelli and the man charged with keeping Mr Bush there an additional four years, has long argued that Catholic voters hold the key to the 2004 election.Roman Catholics make up nearly a quarter of the American population, and 82 per cent of those Catholics who voted in 1960 backed John F Kennedy. This has changed, and last year Al Gore's share of the Catholic vote was only three per cent more than Bush's: 50 per cent to 47.Catholics, once decidedly Democratic, are now beginning to become reliably Republican. And the more frequently a Catholic goes to Mass, the more likely he is to vote for Mr Bush. Compassionate conservatism, with its emphasis on the sanctity of life but also on the role of the state in helping the poor, has strong resonance in Catholicism.Although the Church clearly condemns the use of embryos for stem cell research, some Catholics argue that there is a difference between a frozen embryo in a laboratory that will probably be destroyed anyway and an embryo planted in a woman's womb.This is the position taken by Senators Orrin Hatch, Strom Thurmond and Bill Frist, not Catholics but all conservative Republicans who are implacably opposed to abortion.To add to the poignancy of the discussions, Nancy Reagan has indicated that she favours research, in the hope that it will prevent others being struck down by Alzheimer's disease in the same way as her husband. The Pope suffers from a condition of the same type as Parkinson's disease.But the Catholic Church insists that the place where conception occurs does not affect the status of the embryo. If Mr Bush goes against the Pope on such a fundamental issue, the political ramifications could be enormous.Since the election, Mr Bush, an evangelical Methodist, has assiduously courted Catholic leaders. He frequently meets archbishops and bishops, and every Thursday at 11am a White House official conducts a telephone conference with Catholic groups around the country. Increasingly, Mr Bush has been using the language of Catholicism. In March, he opened a Washington building named after Pope John Paul II and spoke of the importance of a 'culture of life' in which 'we must defend in love the innocent child waiting to be born'.Against this background, the decision on stem cell research could be momentous. Mr Bush's public indecision has probably ensured that he will face a barrage of criticism whatever he decides.If he sticks to his election pledge to ban federal funding, he will be branded by his opponents as an extreme Right-wing fundamentalist. There would also be the strong suspicion that the quest for Catholic support had trumped principle. The St Louis Post-Dispatch has been typical in imploring the president to 'save lives not votes'.Changing his mind could be even more disastrous. If Dubya is rolled on this one, supporters ask, then what will he be rolled on next? Some conservatives are already whispering that the stem cell issue could be the equivalent of Mr Bush's father's infamous retreat from his pledge 'read my lips, no new taxes'. Party activists were demoralised and president George Bush Snr served only one term.During Mr Bush's visit to London last week, he was asked whether the support for research among party allies such as Senator Frist, a surgeon who has advised him on medical issues, would give him the necessary 'political cover' to compromise. One compromise could be to allow research on stem cells only from existing embryos while at the same time allocating additional funding for adult stem cell research and repudiating the harvesting of embryos for scientific purposes.For many of us in the crammed press conference room at RAF Halton, Mr Bush's answer had the ring of authenticity. 'This is way beyond politics,' he said. 'This is an issue that speaks to morality and science and the juxtaposition of both. And the American people deserve a president who will listen to the people and make a serious, thoughtful judgment.'If Bill Clinton were in the same fix as Mr Bush, he would no doubt agonise in much the same way before invoking Mr Reagan's medical plight in the speech announcing federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.But Mr Bush might also remember that Mr Reagan often won respect - and sometimes votes - from people who disagreed with him because he was seen to act on deeply held principle. Unlike Mr Bush Snr, he was not easily bent by the prevailing political wind.No doubt the Pope will appeal to Mr Bush to focus on what he believes in before making his decision. The announcement of that decision and the manner in which it is made will show whether Mr Bush is sticking to principles like Ronald Reagan or trimming like another George Bush."
telegraph,13/12/2010 17:00,news,"Leukaemia research has taken a 'critical step forward', say British scientists, after they managed to turn off faulty stem cells that trigger the disease.By suppressing a protein in the blood, the team at King's College London   transformed leukaemic stem cells back into ordinary ones without cancerous   features. They also managed to 're-sensitise' the most aggressive leukaemic stem cells,   which had become resistant to treatment, so they responded to anti-cancer   drugs. Professor Eric So, who led the team, said: 'These results are extremely   exciting and represent a critical step forward in the search for more   effective treatments for this devastating form of leukaemia. 'The findings provide compelling evidence that this protein could be   exploited to develop an effective therapeutic target for this form of the   disease.' The study, reported in the journal Cancer Cell, involved a dangerous   strain of leukaemia driven by defects in the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL)   gene. Stem cells are immature cells that can develop into a number of different   mature cells. People with MLL have leukaemic stem cells which are part-way along the path to   being cancerous white blood cells, although not all of them reach this   stage. The researchers showed in mice how 'normal' stem cells could become   leukaemic stem cells and induce cancer. They discovered that the process involved activation of a blood protein called   beta-catenin. Suppressing this protein delayed the onset of cancer, slowed   down cancer growth, and reversed leukaemic stem cells to a pre-cancerous   stage. When beta-catenin was completely inactivated in mice with pre-leukaemic cells,   the animals did not develop cancer despite carrying all the necessary MLL   mutations. Laboratory studies on leukaemic cells from human patients again showed that   suppressing beta-catenin lessened their ability to multiply and renew   themselves. "

It marks a proof of principle that a Japanese developed alternative to cloning embryos is capable of growing a patient's own tissue, by converting adult skin cells into an embryonic state.            In this case, the embryonic cells created from two elderly patients with motor neuron disease, which is thought to affect Prof Stephen Hawking among many others, was turned into nerve cells so that new insights can be obtained into the cause of their nerve degeneration. The cells can also be used to test drugs.          In the long term, the new method could be applied to grow a patient's own cells and tissues which, if the underlying cause of the disease is corrected in them, could be used to create tailor-made cells to treat debilitating disease.          The research is published in the journal Science by a team led by Prof Kevin Eggan of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts.          This is the first time that skin cells from a chronically-ill patient have been reprogrammed into a stem cell-like state, and then coaxed into the specific cell types that would be needed to understand and test treatments for the disease, a form of motor neuron disease called ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.          'No one has ever managed to isolate these neurons from a patient and grow them in a dish,' Prof Eggan said. 'Now we can make limitless supplies of the cells that die in this awful disease.'          'This is a seminal discovery,' said Valerie Estess, director of research for Project ALS, a non profit making organisation dedicated to fighting the disease 'The ability to derive ALS motor neurons through a simple skin biopsy opens the doors to improved drug discovery.         'For the first time, researchers will be able to look at ALS cells under a microscope and see why they die. If we can figure out how a person's motor neurons die, we will figure out how to save motor neurons.'          In this case, the patients, sisters aged 89 and the other 92, had a mild form linked with a particular genetic change. The change, which is present in the lab grown versions, causes the degeneration and death of motor neurons, the nerve cells which convey nerve impulses from the spinal cord to each of the body's muscles.         The death of motor neurons leads to paralysis of these muscles, including those involved in swallowing and breathing, and ultimately leads to death of the patient.          'Up until now, it's been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by the disease and, although everyone was excited by the potential of the new technology, it was uncertain that we would be able to obtain them from patients' skin cells,' says co-author Prof Chris Henderson, co-director of the Centre for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease at Columbia University, New York.         'Our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patient's own neurons. This will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life.'          The motor neurons were created using a new technique that reprograms human adult skin cells into cells that resemble embryonic stem cells. The technique used to make these cells - called induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells - was a major advance in the field that was first reported in 2006 by Prof Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University.         The Yamanaka method looked so promising that the scientist who led the team that created Dolly the sheep by cloning, Sir Ian Wilmut, announced last year that he would use it instead of the Dolly method, also in studies of motor neuron disease.          The Yamanaka method offers advantages because cloning requires the use of human eggs, which are in short supply, and the creation of human embryos, which is bitterly opposed by pro life groups.          Sir Ian commented: 'In their haste to think of using cells for therapy many people seem to over look the enormous value of new opportunities to use cells to study inherited diseases. Cells that are from a person who has inherited a disease will have the characteristics of the disease.         'In order to discover the changes that lead to the symptoms of the disease, a comparison can be made between the patient's cells and those from a healthy person. In this case with ALS, the authors have begun work to produce the nerves that are affected in the disease - the motor neurons which give the disease its other name.          'This is the first time that this has been achieved and is an interesting step forward. The initial objective is to use these cells in laboratory tests to identify new drugs that are able to prevent the symptoms of the disease.         'While this offers new hope, it should be noted that it will be several years, perhaps 10 years, before the first drugs become available.          'The authors have chosen to study ALS, but other groups are adopting the same approach to studying other inherited diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and causes of sudden heart failure. Overall it is likely that this will be one of the most important uses of stem cells during the next 10 to 20 years.'          The work is a major step toward scientists' belief that stem cell research will eventually make it possible to treat patients suffering from chronic diseases with stem cell-based treatments created from their own cells.          But the use of this method to grow replacement cells is further off. There are safety issues with iPS cells, including a risk of cancer, because the present method used to make them (alternatives are under development) relies on a virus to introduce four genes to reprogramme the cells. Doctors also have to find a way to reintroduce healthy cells into a sick adult in a way that will be beneficial.                     South Korea will not allow disgraced cloning expert Hang Woo-Suk to resume human stem cell research, after an application was turned down by the country's national committee on bioethics.         "
telegraph,5/9/2012 22:00,news,"One of the biggest mysteries in genetics has been solved after an international team of hundreds of scientists uncovered the secrets of “junk DNA”.Hailed as the biggest breakthrough in genomics in a decade, the project   explained how swathes of DNA once thought to have no purpose, actually form   a complex “control panel” for our genes. The study is expected to lead to new medical treatments by pinpointing key   areas of the genome which cause diseases such as cancer. Certain “switches” have already been linked to 100 diseases including Crohn’s   disease, childhood diabetes and schizophrenia. Only one to two per cent of   our genome contains genes, the parts of our DNA bearing instructions for the   creation of proteins from which cells are made. The remainder of the genome, especially areas located far away from genes, was   initially thought to have no purpose and was dismissively labelled “junk   DNA”. In the new project, named Encode, scientists found that 80 per cent of the   “junk” region helps dictate how and where proteins are produced. In particular, they found four million areas which act like dimmer switches   for individual genes, dictating how active or inactive each one is. In 30 academic papers published across three scientific journals, experts from   32 institutions throughout the world, including Britain, compiled a detailed   map of four million pieces of DNA which regulate how our genes work. In the past two decades, scientists had begun to realise that “junk” areas   must have some function, because they appeared to influence our   susceptibility to disease. But the researchers said they had been astonished   to find how many parts of the genome were playing an active role. Dr Ewan Birney, a Cambridge scientist who helped lead the project, said: “This   idea of junk DNA – we always knew must be something more than protein coding   genes, things that switch them on and off. But I really was not expecting   this number and density of switches. It feels like a jungle out there. It is   not a neat orderly place. It is absolutely full of life.”Mapping out how the “switches” work will enable other scientists to examine   more closely how mutations in each part of the genome can lead to disease,   and potentially develop new treatments, he added. In the next five years the data, published in the Nature, Genome Biology and   Genome Research journals will be used to recategorise diseases, for example   cancers which can often be broken down into sub-types based on their genetic   profile. Longer-term goals will be to determine whether existing drugs could be   effective against different conditions, and ultimately to develop new and   better targeted drugs. var tmg_ooyala_embded_tag = 'http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?embedCode=o0bzJ0NTpLVsGbL2WW2ZtFEmOnmij6zw&width=460&height=258&deepLinkEmbedCode=o0bzJ0NTpLVsGbL2WW2ZtFEmOnmij6zw&video_pcode=RvbGU6Z74XE_a3bj4QwRGByhq9h2&playerBrandingId=7dfd98005dba40baacc82277f292e522&thruParam_tmgui[relatedVideo]=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.api.ooyala.com%2Fv2%2Fassets%3Fwhere%3Dembed_code%2Bin%2B%2528%2527IzdDJ0NTqpq89ZBS1d8KaDY1guvwIb9n%2527%252C%2527djeTJ0NToy9x-BHi33nYqywTja5jAydj%2527%2529%26api_key%3DRvbGU6Z74XE_a3bj4QwRGByhq9h2.WFFAb%26expires%3D1640995199%26signature%3Dmuy%252B7oE3ykUFlvnlNBtxPwB2c%252Bh20e753PiVJtO44j4'+'&thruParam_doubleclick[tagUrl]=' + tmgAdsBuildAdTag('vid', '620x415', 'adx', ';dcmt=text/xml;psz=460x315', 3);document.write('<scr'+'ipt src=''+tmg_ooyala_embded_tag +''></scr'+'ipt>');A group of dancers performed an aerial silk spectacle at the Science   Museum in London, which they call the Dance of the DNA.

telegraph,8/11/2010 7:30,news,"Patients could soon be transfused with blood made from their own skin in a breakthrough that could revolutionise cancer treatments and solve the blood donor shortage. Scientists have shown that ordinary skin cells can effectively be converted   into adult blood cells in the laboratory. They believe that a two inch square patch of skin – taken from anywhere on the   body – could be enough to make enough blood for a full transfusion. What is more because the blood is made from the patient's own cells, there is   no danger of the body rejecting it. The Canadian team say that the process has been so successful that they could   try the treatment in patient within two years.  'There is incredible need here,' said Dr Mick Bhatia, who headed   the team at McMaster University in Ontario.  'For patients with disease this will be an alternative source of blood   that will not be rejected.  'People will effectively become their own donors. We are very excited   and very enthusiastic about it.  'There is a lot of work to be done but I would be disappointed if we   were not trying it on patients by 2012.' The research, published in Nature, is part of ongoing attempts across the   world to revert adult cells back to their original stem cell form. Stem cells are 'master cells' which can be manipulated in a   laboratory to become any other cell in the body. The McMaster team have managed to misses out the 'in-between' stage   of turning the cells back to stem cells and then converting to blood cells. Instead the process – which uses various proteins to re-programme the cells   and takes a month – converts skin cells straight to blood. Leukaemia patients are likely to be the first to receive transfusions of   perfectly matched blood generated from their own skin. In future, laboratory manufactured blood could help to plug the gap caused by   donor shortages, the scientists believe. It could be used in surgery, to treat patients with anaemia and other blood   conditions, and to prevent cancer therapy having to be stopped prematurely   because of depletion the body's stock of blood cells. The technique also holds out the promise of making other kinds of cell,   including neurons with the potential to treat brain diseases such as   Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Dr Bhatia, director of the Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute at McMaster   University, said: 'We don't envision many obstacles. Us being able to   take skin cells and convert them into healthy blood, specifically adult   blood, would provide a great substitute product to hopefully out-compete   those leukaemic cells.' The breakthrough arose from observations made several years ago during early   work on so-called induced pluripotent stem cells. These are ordinary cells that have been genetically tweaked to make them   revert to an embryonic state. They then adopt the characteristics and properties of embryonic stem cells –   stem cells extracted from early human embryos. Most importantly, they are 'pluripotent', having the potential   ability to grow into many different kinds of cell. During the process, a small number of skin cells seemed to jump spontaneously   to the stage of being immature blood cells. Building on these studies, Dr Bhatia's team found a genetic and chemical   recipe that made it possible to generate a full range of adult blood cell   progenitors from skin cells called fibroblasts. The 'lineages' included different kinds of white blood cell, red   cells, and the cells that generate blood clotting platelets. The technique involves inserting a specific transcription factor – a protein   that interacts with DNA to activate genes – and applying other treatment in   the form of signalling molecules called cytokines. Skin cells from both young and old people were used in the research to prove   that age of donor made no difference to the process. A number of the cells were successfully grafted into mice. Dr Bhatia said: 'We   have shown this works using human skin. We know how it works and believe we   can even improve on the process. We'll now go on to work on developing other   types of human cell types from skin, as we already have encouraging evidence.' He said the new technique was quicker than its predecessors and made 'the   right types of blood cells'. Next the scientists plan to assess what kind of production capacity might be   possible with the cells, and whether they can successfully be stored in deep   freeze. Professor John Hunt, a leading stem cell scientist from the University of   Liverpool, said: 'I think it's fantastic research, but it's not yet in   the clinic and we don't know if these red blood cells are going to carry   oxygen. The quantum leap for us all is going to be to get these kind of   bench experiments into the patient.  'It might be two years or 10 years, but it's right to be optimistic   because we're expecting breakthroughs. However it's still too early to say   'this is it'.  'This opens a lot of doors, and if we could produce red blood cells we'd   be solving a big clinical need.' "

Stem cells isolated from early human embryos can be turned into all 200 cell types for treatments of ailments from heart disease to Alzheimer's.          The pro-life movement claimed that adult stem cells, such as those from bone marrow, can 'transdifferentiate' and be turned into nerve, heart muscle and other types, and claimed that this makes human embryo research redundant.          Prof Austin Smith, of Edinburgh University's Institute of Stem Cell Research, said that although he supports continuing studies of adult stem cells, the claims they could 'transdifferentiate', notably from bone marrow to heart cells, were false.

As a police officer in Leicester, he had to be on   duty during the summer riots. However, the 52-year-old father of two was devastated to learn he was   suffering a relapse of acute myeloid leukaemia, a rare cancer of the white   blood cells, for which he had been treated with chemotherapy two years   earlier. The cancer occurs when large numbers of abnormal, immature white blood cells,   called myeloid cells, spill out of the bone marrow where they are made, into   the bloodstream. They fail to develop into normal blood cells, leaving the   body open to serious infection. What triggers the process is unclear,  but   doctors suspect it is due to an abnormality in the bone marrow stem cells    from which myeloid cells derive. (Stem cells are primitive cells that can   grow into different types of cells in different parts of the body). Some   2,700 new cases of AML are diagnosed annually – 700 of them in people under   60.Rik’s only chance of survival rests on a bone marrow transplant, using stem   cells from a healthy donor whose tissues match his own. In 30 per cent of   such cases, a family match is found – but none of Rik’s three brothers has   proved suitable. Nor is there a matching donor registered with Anthony   Nolan, the charity that holds the largest of two stem-cell registers in the   UK. That leaves Rik dependent on a new volunteer coming forward. “Rik needs a transplant within weeks,” says Dr Murray Martin, consultant   haematologist at Leicester Royal Infirmary, where Rik has been undergoing   chemotherapy. “Otherwise, he will succumb to the disease.”Rik’s dilemma highlights the urgent need for more volunteer stem cell donors   to treat all types of leukaemia, says Jenner Large, regional recruitment   manager for Anthony Nolan. Only 0.7 per cent of people in the UK donate. “People still think donating bone marrow stem cells is painful and invasive,”   says Miss Large. The procedure can be compared to giving blood, though it   takes longer. As Rik is Asian, his chances of finding a donor are even slimmer. His best   chance of a match is from an Asian male aged 18-40. Yet, of the 420,000   volunteers on the charity’s register, only 4 per cent are Asian. “Unlike blood, where there are only eight main groupings, there are millions   of varieties of proteins in blood stem cells,” says Miss Large. “The best   chance of finding stem cells with similar proteins is among families – or   the same ethnic group. It’s difficult to pinpoint any one reason why the   Asian community doesn’t come forward, but the biggest problem is lack of   awareness that donors are needed and what the process involves.”The charity is campaigning to double the number of stem cell donors on its   register, particularly from Asian and other ethnic minority groups. Would-be volunteers are asked to send a saliva sample to the charity, from   which their tissues are analysed and details entered on a database. They   have a one-in-1,000 chance of their tissues being matched to a cancer   patient, and being asked to donate. Donors then need several injections to   stimulate the growth of blood stem cells and half a day as a hospital   outpatient, hooked up to a machine that harvests cells from the blood. The   only side-effects are feeling tired and “fluey” for a couple of days   afterwards. “This isn’t only for me but for other people who are going to be faced with   this dreadful disease in future,” says Rik. He adds: “It’s a chance for   people to save a life without it impacting too much on their own.”For more details, visit www.anthonynolan.org"

British scientists want to use the technique to create embryonic stem cells so they can study the causes of and develop treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cystic fibrosis, motor neurone disease and Huntington's.         The HFEA was due to rule on the research applications in January but instead announced a public consultation which found 61 per cent of the public in favour of the research.         Dr Belinda Cupid, of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, said: 'This position by the HFEA is very encouraging. There is currently no cure for MND, but allowing the use of hybrid and chimera embryos in scientific research may revolutionise the future treatment of this disease and other degenerative neurological conditions.         'The case for the use of human-animal hybrid embryos in stem cell research is compelling as it holds the potential to save lives'         Rebecca Wood, the chief executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, said: 'This decision could speed up progress towards treatments in the future.'         Dr Stephen Minger, at King's College, London, and Dr Lyle Armstrong, at the North East England Stem Cell Institute in Newcastle, applied to the HFEA to carry out research involving the creation of cytoplasmic hybrids, also known as cybrids, last year.         Dr Minger said yesterday: 'These techniques provide the only ethically justifiable option given the large numbers of eggs required to derive cloned human stem cell lines from individuals with incurable and highly progressive neurological disorders.'         Yesterday's announcement means such work will 'in principle' be permitted. However, each proposal will be examined individually and decisions on the applications already submitted are expected in November.         In a statement, the HFEA said: 'Having looked at all the evidence the authority has decided that there is no fundamental reason to prevent cytoplasmic hybrid research.'         The decision is controversial because current laws only give the HFEA powers to regulate research involving human embryos, except for the use of the so-called 'hamster test' - the fertilisation of a hamster egg to test the viability of human sperm.                                       In May the Government published its draft Human Tissue and Embryos Bill, which proposed allowing the creation of cybrids, but retaining the ban on 'true hybrids', in which the sperm from one species fertilises an egg from another.         Ian Pearson, the science and innovation minister, said last night: 'I share the view of the scientific community that the creation of cytoplasmic hybrid embryos offers an important experimental tool.         'This is in the best interests of science. I am determined that the UK remains at the forefront of stem cell research and development.'         Opponents of the research, who claim it is unnecessary and unethical, believe the HFEA does not have the powers to give the go-ahead for such work.         The Lawyers' Christian Fellowship and Comment on Reproductive Ethics (Core) will meet with their advisers this week to discuss seeking a judicial review of the decision.

A Japanese team made headlines worldwide a few days ago when it announced a way to turn adult skin cells, taken from a woman's face, into embryonic stem cells, the body's building blocks used during growth and repair, which offer a way to treat patients suffering a vast range of conditions with personalised replacement cells and tissue.            Now 'direct reprogramming,' which offers an alternative to the use of human eggs and cloning, has been used for the first time to cure a disease, marking the first 'proof of principle' that this method has great promise in treating hereditary blood disorders, though the potential to rebuild a diseased or damaged body is much greater even than this.            Mice with the faulty gene responsible for human sickle-cell anaemia were treated successfully, so they made normal red blood cells instead of those of a sickle shape that clog blood vessels, causing severe pain, anaemia and, over time, a wide range of organ damage, even death.          An American team has treated the disorder using a process that begins by directly reprogramming cells from the mice to an embryonic-stem-cell-like state, so called 'induced pluripotent stem' cells, or IPS cells. These cells were genetically altered to remove the genetic defect responsible for the disease, then used to rebuild the blood of the mice.          The treatment, reported today in the journal Science, was a collaborative effort between the laboratories of Prof Rudolf Jaenisch at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, near Boston, and Prof Tim Townes of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.          The scientists successfully treated mice containing human sickle genes using a variant of the embryo-free approach originally discovered by Prof Shinya Yamanaka at Kyoto University.          Mice with sickle-cell anaemia were developed by Prof Townes by introducing a faulty version of a gene that is involved in blood production in the bone marrow.          To treat them with the new method, the scientists started with cells from the tail skin of the diseased mice, explains coauthor Dr Jacob Hanna.          These cells were then reprogrammed using a virus to introduce four genes to convert them to an embryonic-stem-cell-like state. To decrease or eliminate possible cancer in the treated mice, one of those genes linked to tumours was removed by genetic manipulation.          Next, the researchers genetically altered the cells once again to fix the faulty gene responsible for sickle cell disease, then added factors to turn these embryonic stem cells into precursors of bone marrow adult stem cells, which were then transplanted into mice to generate normal blood cells.          The blood of treated mice was tested to reveal that the disease was corrected, with measurements of blood and kidney functions similar to those of normal mice. 'This demonstrates that IPS cells have the same potential for therapy as embryonic stem cells, without the ethical and practical issues raised in creating embryonic stem cells,' says Prof Jaenisch.          While IPS cells offer tremendous promise for regenerative medicine, scientists caution that major challenges must be overcome before medical applications can be considered. First among these is to find a better way to create them, since the viruses they use for reprogramming can damage DNA and disrupt other genes.          Despite the rapid progress being made with the new method, Prof Jaenisch emphasises that this field is very young, and that it's critical to continue full research on embryonic stem cells as well.         'We wouldn't have known anything about IPS cells if we hadn't worked with embryonic stem cells,' he says. 'For the foreseeable future, there will remain a continued need for embryonic stem cells as the crucial assessment tool for measuring the therapeutic potential of IPS cells.'          But if the hurdles can be overcome, the method has great promise. 'Most hereditary blood disorders could be corrected in this way,' says Prof Townes.          In Britain sickle cell disease is most common in people of African and Caribbean descent (at least 1 in 10-40 have sickle cell trait and 1 in 60-200 have the actual disorder). It is estimated there are over 6,000 adults and children with the disorder in Britain."
telegraph,10/6/2012 8:10,news,"Scientists have grown human bone from stem cells in a laboratory. Scientists have grown human bone from stem cells in a laboratory. The development opens the way for patients to have broken bones repaired or   even replaced with entire new ones grown outside the body from a patient's   own cells. The researchers started with stem cells taken from fat tissue. It took around   a month to grow them into sections of fully-formed living human bone up to a   couple of inches long. The first trial in patients is on course to be conducted later this year, by   an Israeli biotechnology company that has been working with academics on the   technology. Professor Avinoam Kadouri, head of the scientific advisory board for Bonus   BioGroup, said: 'There is a need for artificial bones for injuries and   in operations. 'We use three dimensional structures to fabricate the bone in the right   shape and geometry. We can grow these bones outside the body and then   transplant it to the patient at the right time. 'By scanning the damaged bone area, the implant should fit perfectly and   merge with the surrounding tissue. There are no problems with rejection as   the cells come from the patient's own body.'The technology, which has been developed along with researchers at the   Technion Institute of Research in Israel, uses three dimensional scans of   the damaged bone to build a gel-like scaffold that matches the shape. Stem cells, known as mesenchymal stem cells, which have the capacity to   develop into many other types of cell in the body, are obtained from the   patient's fat using liposuction. These are then grown into living bone on the scaffold inside a 'bioreactor'   – an automated machine that provides the right conditions to encourage the   cells to develop into bone. Already animals have   successfully received bone transplants. The scientists were able to   insert almost an inch of laboratory-grown human bone into the middle section   of a rat's leg bone, where it successfully merged with the remaining animal   bone. The technique could ultimately allow doctors to replace bones that have been   smashed in accidents, fill in defects where bone is missing such as cleft   palate, or carry out reconstructive plastic surgery. Professor Kadouri said work was also under way to grow the soft cartilage at   the ends of bones, which is needed if entire bones are to be produced in a   laboratory. Bone grafts currently involve taking bits of bone from elsewhere in the   patients body and transplanting them to the area which is damaged to   encourage healing. More than 250,000 bone grafts are performed in the UK each year, including   repairs to damaged jaws and the replacement of bone lost in operations to   remove tumours. This technique requires the patient to undergo two traumatic operations. In   other cases bone is obtained from donations, but can be rejected by the   body. As the new technique uses cells from the patient's own body, it reduces the   chance of the new bone being rejected. Dr Shai Meretzki, chief executive of Bonus BioGroup, added that they hoped to   develop the technology in the future to provide replacements for damaged   joints such as hips. He said: 'It is the same type of technology, but the equipment would be   different for bigger bones.'A number of research teams around the world are developing techniques for   regrowing bone using stem cells, but most have used a different kind of stem   cell and injected them into the patient rather than growing them into bones   outside the body for transplant. Professor Alicia El Haj, head of the regenerative medicine group at Keele   University, has been involved in clinical trial using cells taken from   cartilage and has treated 450 patients with the technique. Her team has   started conducting trials to repair gaps in patient's bones using cells from   bone marrow. She said: 'Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells are much less common   when used medically, but are easier to obtain. 'There are a lot of people coming up with cells that can be used to   repair bone but there are not many progressing to produce tissues that can   be grown outside of the body and used clinically. 'If a company is starting to do this, then it is an important step.'"
telegraph,13/07/2000 00:00,news,"SCIENTISTS have improved or restored the eyesight of 10 out of 14 patients treated with a new technique in which new corneal cells grown in the laboratory replace damaged tissue.                                Click to enlarge           Severe injury such as a chemical splash or fire and some rare disorders can destroy the cells necessary to repair damage. The scientists have applied techniques for growing skin, used for burns victims, to the eye.The patients' corneal stem cells had been destroyed by injury or disease. The corneas become opaque and scarred, causing blindness or poor sight. Corneal stem cells are the 'mother cells' which produce only new corneal cells to replace damaged ones. The researchers took healthy corneal stem cells from the patient's undamaged eye or from a close relative if both eyes were damaged.The stem cells produce a fragile layer of corneal cells only one cell thick. The new cells are transferred on to a matric amniotic membrane (donated by mothers after childbirth). The cells continue to grow until there is a layer five to 10 cells deep. The damaged corneal tissue is removed and the new layer, including the active stem cells, is sewn on to the eye.The technique was developed by Prof Ivan Schwab and Prof Rivkah Isseroff of the University of California Davis School of Medicine and is described in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr Isseroff, a professor of dermatology, said yesterday: 'We learned about skin and then used the knowledge to create biological skin for burns patients. Now we have transplanted that knowledge to the eye. In future we hope to transplant it to the lung, gastro-intestinal tract and bladder.'Dr Schwab, professor of ophthalmology, said the next stage is to learn more about the long-term effects of the transplants before the procedure can be widely offered. He said: 'The really exciting thing is where this can take us. Replacing diseased tissue and organs with bio-engineered tissue is rapidly moving from the realm of science- fiction to reality.'One of the first patients to benefit is George Norman, 69, from Calousa, California, who lost most of his sight in a chemical accident. Six traditional corneal transplants had failed. Often the transplant does not contain the important stem cells. Last year he had another corneal transplant supplemented by corneal stem cells from his son. Mr Norman said: 'Everything is bright again. More people need to know about this procedure.'In another report in the journal, Taiwanese scientists describe a similar technique. They have reversed loss of sight in six patients. The team from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital says it seeded the stem cells directly on to the amniotic membrane."
telegraph,14/11/2012 02:45,news,"Scientists have used the DNA code of MRSA to work out where outbreaks occur so they can be halted more quickly. A new device can identify specific bacterial strains from their genetic codes   so experts can target the transmission path of the infection and cut it off. In an early test of the technology, researchers halted an outbreak of the MRSA   superbug in a special care baby unit at the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge. It is believed to be the first time DNA sequencing has been used to contain an   infectious disease outbreak at a hospital. The scientists are now developing the concept into a simple system that can be   used routinely by hospital staff who are not genetics experts. In future, it could be used to combat many kinds of infection outbreak, and   also help doctors decide the best way of treating patients. Professor Sharon Peacock, from Cambridge University, who led the research   team, told a news briefing in London: ''What we're working towards is   effectively a 'black box'. Information on the genome sequence goes into the   system and is interpreted, and what comes out the other end is a report to   the health care worker. ''It could, for example, determine the species of the bacterium; it could   determine antibiotic susceptibility, and it could provide information about   what genes are present that are often associated with poor outcomes in   patients. ''It will give information about how related that organism is to other   organisms within the same setting, giving an indication of the capability of   transmission from one patient to another.'' A report on how the baby unit outbreak was brought under control appears in   the latest issue of the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases. The scientists used a technique called rapid whole genome sequencing, which   maps an organism's entire genetic code, to analyse MRSA bacteria taken from   12 babies. MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is an antibiotic resistant   form of a common skin bug that can cause potentially deadly wound infections   in hospitals. Standard procedures had not been able to show whether a genuine outbreak had   occurred, or whether the babies had all coincidentally been exposed to MRSA. The team was quickly able to confirm that 10 babies were part of an MRSA   outbreak involving a previously unknown strain of the bug. It also became clear from swab tests of parents and visitors that the bacteria   had spread outside the hospital into the community. Measures were introduced to clear MRSA from carriers and deep-clean wards, but   two months later a new infection case was identified in the baby unit. DNA sequencing showed it was caused by the same strain identified earlier,   carried to the ward by one of 154 screened health care workers. Co-author Dr Julian Parkhill, head of pathogen genomics at the Wellcome Trust   Sanger Institute in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, said: ''The staff member was   decolonised and went back to work, and we believe this brought the outbreak   to a close.'' He said he expected the cost of whole genome sequencing of bacteria to fall   from around £100 per sample to £50, and ultimately just ''a few pounds'' in   the near future. ''People are talking about the thousand dollar human genome,'' he added. ''If you can do the human genome for a thousand dollars you can do a bacterial   genome for one dollar.'' The MRSA outbreak at the Rosie Hospital, part of Cambridge University   Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, was estimated to have cost the NHS around   £10,000. This was double the cost of the DNA sequencing, said the   researchers. Comprehensive databases of bacterial genomes and drug resistance will have to   be established before the infection control ''black box'' can be introduced,   they pointed out. Asked when the technology might become routinely available, Dr Parkhill said:   ''Maybe in the next few years.'' Dr Nick Brown, consultant microbiologist at the Health Protection Agency and   infection control doctor at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, said:   ''What we have glimpsed through this pioneering study is a future in which   new sequencing methods will help us to identify, manage and stop hospital   outbreaks and deliver even better patient care.'' A Health Protection Agency report in May said more than 6% of hospital   patients in England acquired some form of infection during their stay. However, a survey found that MRSA hospital infection rates had fallen   significantly in recent years. Compared with previous survey results in 2006, the proportion of patients   becoming infected with the bug in England had dropped from 1.8% to less than   0.1%. Rates of infection by Clostridium difficile (C. diff), another ward bug, had   fallen from 2% to 0.4% in English hospitals. "
telegraph,1/2/2007 0:01,news,"Sir Richard Branson's latest venture is a bank which will allow parents to store stem cells from their children.           For around £1,500, the new company will take a sample of blood from a child’s umbilical cord and place it in frozen storage.                                         Some scientists believe advances in medicine will in the future allow stem cells to be used to cure diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and cancer.           If this happens, a child who falls ill later in life may have a much better chance of survival if they have an exact stem cell match in storage.           The company, which will trade under the Virgin brand, is following a trend in America, where thousands of parents have paid to have stem cells stored.           However, many experts in the UK say there is insufficient evidence to recommend the practice.           A Virgin spokesperson said: “This is a unique initiative that will help address the global shortage of matched stem cells available to patients who need life-saving treatments.           “The initiative will also help drive further research into regenerative medicine and treatments with stem cells.”          A few companies already offer the service in the UK, but the take-up has been limited.           Among the parents reported to have used these services are Thierry Henry, the Arsenal footballer, and Darcey Bussell, the dancer.           Aside from the £1,500 initial fee, around  £100 is usually payable per year for cold storage.           The Royal College of Nursing, and other medical bodies, have in the past said the routine collection of umbilical blood is wasteful as future treatments are purely theoretical.           The NHS already collects around 2,000 cord blood samples a year for anyone who needs a cord blood cell transplant.           Sir Richard Branson’s best known ventures to date are Virgin’s air travel, trains and soft drinks companies.           However, he has already signalled a strategy to invest in technologies of the future with the launch of Virgin Galactic, which will take tourists into space.          Sir Richard - who has already been given a licence by the Medicines and Health Regulatory Agency to store cord blood - will today announce his intentions to do so at a British Medical Association briefing, attended by top experts in the field.           Those close to Sir Richard say the move is not a purely commercial one, but is also driven by philanthropic aims.          Sir Richard shares the hopes of many scientists, who believe stem cell research will one day offer cures for hundreds of deadly diseases.            Virgin will reportedly allow the NHS access to the stored stem cells in order to aid research into future treatments.  "
telegraph,20/03/2010 07:50,news,"Stem cell medicine is now moving so fast, that the only thing holding it up this week was the London traffic. At 8.15am on Monday, an international team of surgeons began a landmark   operation on a ten-year-old British boy at Great Ormond Street Hospital. He needed life saving surgery to replace his windpipe with one taken from a   donor, before the artificial one that was allowing him to breathe caused   massive bleeding in his throat for the third time. However, instead of receiving a normal donor organ - which requires powerful   drugs to stop the body rejecting the organ - he underwent a world first and   became the first child to have an organ transplanted which had been created   using his own stem cells. At birth, the boy had a windpipe measuring just one millimetre across and was   unable to breath. However, the metal device implanted to support it had,   over time, pushed itself into his blood vessels and threatened to cause a   life-endangering bleed. Monday's operation to replace it was critical to prevent that. The process had begun six weeks earlier in Florence, Italy, when a replacement   windpipe, known as a trachea, was taken from a 30-year-old woman donor. A   team of doctors used enzymes to strip it of all tissue that could cause it   to be rejected once implanted in the recipient. In similar operations previously carried out on adults, that process has taken   three months but it was reduced to six weeks to minimise the risk of the   child suffering another major bleed. The donor trachea was then flown from Florence to London on Sunday, while Prof   Paolo Macchiarini, of the Careggi University Hospital in Florence that   treated the donor organ, then flew out to join the British team of surgeons. Once the boy was anaesthetised, the doctors at Great Ormond Street removed   60ml or five tablespoons worth of bone marrow from his pelvis. This was couriered by bike to the Royal Free Hospital where a specialist   laboratory run by Dr Mark Lowdell separated two types of stem cell from the   rest of the bone marrow. Around 2.5 million stem cells, enough to fill two tablespoons, were mixed with   chemicals to trigger growth and were then couriered back to Great Ormond   Street. Dr Lowdell said: 'What we did was embarrassingly simple.' The courier arrived back at Great Ormond Street with the precious cargo just   before lunchtime. The stem cells were then injected into the inner and outer   surface of the donor trachea. Prof Macchiarini said: 'What had previously taken six months was possible   in four hours. It could have been better but for the traffic in London.' While the stem cells were being driven across London and back, the surgeons at   Great Ormond Street repaired a hole in the boy's main blood vessel from his   heart. His old metal scaffold that had been supporting his damaged windpipe   had burrowed into the blood vessel and meant another massive bleed could   begin at any time. The delicate repair of the aorta, which is challenging surgery in itself, was   complete by the time the courier arrived back with the stem cells. The metal stent and the damaged windpipe were then removed and the new donor   one was implanted with a dissolvable scaffold to hold it open and in place   while the stem cells grow to cover it in new tissue over the next few weeks. By 5pm, the surgery was over and regenerative medicine had taken a major step   forward. "

He will be one of the speakers at today's meeting to celebrate 25 years of in vitro fertilisation technology at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, London.When Louise Brown, the first 'test-tube baby', was born in 1978, doctors helped around one in 20 infertile patients. Today, the figure is around three in four. By combining stem cell technology and fertility treatment, 'in future, everyone who is infertile will be helped', said Prof Trounson. 'We will be able to take cells and reconstruct the equivalent of sperm and eggs,' he said. This would come in a '10-year plus' horizon, a view that was backed by the IVF pioneer, Prof Robert Edwards.Earlier this year, a team led by Prof Hans Scholer of the University of Pennsylvania reported the production of egg-like cells from mouse embryonic stem cells - the parent cells of all other types.Dr Toshiaki Noce, of the Mitsubishi Kagaku Institute of Life Science, Tokyo, has pushed embryonic stem cells towards sperm production, yielding the precursors of sperm. Yesterday, Dr Noce said he had not used them to create healthy mice yet.However, assuming this research would continue, embryonic stem cells could be used to make sperm and eggs, said Prof Trounson. To obtain stem cells from an infertile patient, it would currently be necessary to use the 'Dolly technique' to create an early cloned embryo.But Prof Trounson expects knowledge to advance so that it becomes possible to turn any cell into an embryonic stem cell, from which sex cells could be created. He said if there were genetic reasons for the underlying infertility, steps would have to be made to correct them in the artificial eggs and sperm.Prof Roger Pederson, of Cambridge University, said stem cells were a biological 'Rosetta stone', and stressed that embryonic stem cell research would not be possible without IVF.The prospect of a cloned baby being born was moving closer, Prof Edwards said. At today's meeting he will discuss a paper that he believes was the first formal report on steps leading towards the first cloned person.The paper, written by Dr Panayiotis Zavos, describes the creation of 'the first human cloned embryo for reproductive purposes'."

The XCell-Center was ordered to close following an investigation by The   Sunday Telegraph into its controversial therapies. The clinic was accused of preying on thousands of vulnerable patients — many   of them British — who travelled to its hospital in Dusseldorf in Germany for   treatment that cost tens of thousands of pounds but was clinically unproven.But after an undercover investigation by The Sunday Telegraph, which   revealed how one child died and another was seriously injured after stem   cells were injected into their brains, German authorities forced the   clinic’s closure.Its chief executive and founder, Cornelis Kleinbloesem, has now relocated his   business to Lebanon, using a London company to process patients’ stem cells. His company, Cells4health, is offering brain surgery for £23,000 and spinal   cord operations for £32,000. It has entered into a partnership with a British firm, Precious Cells   International, which is licensed by the Human Tissue Authority, the British   watchdog. The case exposes a loophole in British and international law on   unproven medical treatments.Although Dr Kleinbloesem is prevented from charging for unproven — and   possibly dangerous — treatments in Europe, he is legally entitled to use the   UK-licensed laboratory to process the stem cells.Patients fly to his clinic in Lebanon where doctors remove bone marrow. This   is then sent to Precious Cells’ laboratory on the campus of Brunel   University, in Uxbridge, west London, for processing.The stem cells are extracted from the bone marrow in the Precious Cells lab   and returned to Lebanon where they are injected into patients with incurable   illnesses such as Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis.Dr Kleinbloesem is using the British lab to facilitate his new venture while   making a virtue of its licence from the British authorities in promotional   material sent to potential patients.He announced his comeback in an email sent to XCell’s patients. He will hope that at least some make the journey to Lebanon for follow-up   treatments.Inquiries by The Sunday Telegraph traced the London laboratory to Precious   Cells International, which was founded by a British scientist, Husein Salem,   two years ago.He said at first he was unsure if Cells4health was linked to XCell but then   added when pressed: “The owner is the same.”Of Dr Kleinbloesem, Dr Salem said: “He is a scientist XCell was closed last   May, following an investigation by The Sunday Telegraph eight months   earlier, which disclosed that an 18-month-old baby from Italy had died after   being injected with stem cells in the brain.

My   understanding is it was actually a needle nicked an artery that led to   haemorrhaging... It wasn’t anything to do with the stem cells themselves.” The XCell clinic previously used a different British company to process stem   cells — a firm called BioVault, the largest human tissue bank in the country.It is understood BioVault, which is based in Plymouth, fell out with Dr   Kleinbloesem.

Douglas Sipp, an academic specialising in scientific ethics and who has   highlighted the problems caused by private stem cell clinics, said: “The   profit margins on spurious stem cell treatments seem to be addictive.

telegraph,27/02/2002 12:58,news,"THE controversial stem cell research on embryos which is banned in the United States has been given the go-ahead in the UK by a House of Lords committee.The decision means that British scientists can create human embryo clones under tight regulations. Licences for the research are likely to be issued almost immediately.The House of Lords Select Committee on Stem Cell Research said research on human embryonic stem cells should be allowed under strictly controlled conditions, but any cloning of embryos should be kept to a minimum.The move allows scientists to start research on adult and embryo stem cells - the body's master cells that have the potential to differentiate into any other type of cell in the body.The controversy arises because stem cells are obtained either from 'spare' human embryos or from cloned embryos obtained from therapeutic cloning.While reproductive cloning is banned, therapeutic cloning is not and there are fears by critics that today's move could be the start of a 'slippery slope' towards reproductive cloning with identical copies of human beings created.The move also gives the go-ahead to a scientific procedure called oocyte nucleus transfer in which an embryo's genes are made up from three parents.The Committee said the procedure should be allowed for research purposes as it could one day benefit people with mitochondrial diseases - a narrow category of disorders that affect a person's metabolism.The Rt Rev Richard Harries, the Bishop of Oxford and chairman of the Committee, said: 'Stem cell research offers real and great hope for the future for a range of common diseases.'These cells can differentiate into 200 types of cell and are an essential benchmark to discover what is going on. It is very important to keep all avenues of research open and we recommend that for the moment this fundamental research is necessary.'He stressed that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which will regulate the research is the 'best regulatory authority' in the world.It will only issue licences if the research is deemed 'necessary and desirable'.The news comes after the first British couple were given permission last week to create a 'designer baby' in an attempt to save their boy's life, while the first cloned kitten was recently paraded to the world's media.Today, the Committee stressed that embryos should not be therapeutically cloned for stem cell research using a process called cell nuclear replacement (CNR) unless there is a 'demonstrable and exceptional need which cannot be met in other ways'."

First there were grumbles about how he got hold of fresh human eggs last year after he stunned the scientific community with the first human clone.          A few weeks ago the egg affair degenerated into a scientific soap opera then concerns about his science surfaced. Yesterday the saga ended with his resignation and disgrace.                                        The world was stunned when a cloned human embryo was unveiled by Prof Hwang Woo-suk. Before his work was published in 2004, claims to have created a human clone had been made. This time, however, details of how to do it were published in Science, one of the subject's most respected journals.          They were reported by a reputable team at Seoul National University, and the human clones were much more advanced than earlier attempts.          But there were qualms. The Koreans had managed to obtain 242 eggs, free, from volunteer donors. This raised eyebrows among American rivals, who would have had to pay thousands of dollars. But Hwang, 53, denied that women in his team donated their own eggs. And he stressed to this newspaper and others that his colleagues had followed guidelines.          Any lingering doubts seemed to be swept away a year later, when the team refined its methods and showed for the first time that cloning could be clinically relevant. In a paper published in Science, and unveiled in London at the Royal Institution, Hwang described how 18 women donated 185 eggs that, with cells from donors, were used to clone embryos and then create lines of embryonic stem cells, each of which could be used to make any of the 200 cell types in the donor patient, with no risk of rejection.          The cells to reprogramme the 185 eggs had been obtained from 11 male and female donors ranging in age from two to 56, including patients who had juvenile diabetes, spinal cord injury and a genetic immune deficiency.          This time there were no quibbles about consent. The Dolly cloning method was used to create 31 embryos which were used to create 11 lines of human embryonic stem cells, with remarkable efficiency. The team also provided evidence that the cell lines matched the patients' cells.          Success depended on many factors, said Prof Gerald Schatten, of the University of Pittsburgh, Hwang's American co-author of the work: the Koreans seemed more adept at microscopic surgery on eggs and embryos; and the eggs were from young donors, high quality, and handled gently.          Last month, the collaboration between Hwang and Prof Schatten was over. Prof Schatten issued a statement that cited 'misrepresentations' about egg collection 'and the resultant breach of trust'. A South Korean television station had also been investigating wider allegations that had also appeared on a website.          In a press conference in Seoul, Hwang admitted that two female scientists in his laboratory had given their own eggs for research. He apologised profusely, confessing that he had lied when the claim was first made in Nature and resigned as the head of a new venture, the World Stem Cell Hub.          Hwang retreated to a remote Buddhist temple, then was admitted to hospital suffering from exhaustion. But when he returned to his lab on Dec 13 the scandal was far from over.          Prof Schatten had by then asked Science to take his name off the May 2005 paper they had unveiled together in the Royal Institution. 'My careful re-evaluations of published figures and tables, along with new problematic information, now cast substantial doubts [on] the paper's accuracy,' Prof Schatten said. 'Over the weekend, I received allegations from someone involved with the experiments that certain elements of the report may be fabricated.'          One question was whether photographs, described in the paper as showing stem cells derived from cloned human embryos, were frauds. A co-author, Roh Sung Il of the MizMedi Hospital, said that they were not derived from cloning experiments. He told journalists that a scientist working for Hwang was pressured into creating the fakes. Another question concerned the veracity of the DNA fingerprints used to show that a stem cell was genetically identical to a person who provided cells for cloning.          Hwang and Prof Schatten subsequently retracted the 2005 paper. However, in a televised news conference, Hwang still maintained that the data were essentially correct. Prof Ian Wilmut, of Edinburgh University, who planned to collaborate with Hwang, was among those who signed a letter to Science, asking him to submit his work for independent confirmation.          Even then, Prof Wilmut was convinced that Hwang's team did succeed in obtaining 11 new stem cell lines from cloned embryos. He himself had to do follow up work to convince high profile sceptics in America that Dolly was a clone of an adult cell.          But then it emerged that in January of this year Hwang had reported to his government sponsors that six of his stem lines had been lost to contamination, an important fact not mentioned in his report later published in Science. A few days ago, Hwang said once again that he was in no doubt that he could repeat the success of his techniques.          Yesterday, Hwang's reputation was in tatters. An investigation led by Roe Jung-hye, Seoul National University's Dean of Research Affairs, found that data for the 11 collections of stem cells Hwang claimed to have made were derived from just two stem cell lines.          'Based on these facts, the data in the 2005 Science paper cannot be some error from a simple mistake, but can only be seen as a deliberate fabrication,' the panel said.          It will now also investigate Hwang's other landmark papers - including a 2004 article on the world's first cloned human embryos, and an August 2005 paper on the first cloned dog, an Afghan hound."
telegraph,22/07/2004 00:01,news,"The fertility watchdog has relaxed  its rules on embryo screening to allow the birth of so-called designer babies to cure sick siblings.                                       The decision means that embryos can be selected so that stem cells can be used to treat a couple's existing children who could die if they were not given transplants.         The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said it made the decision because it felt that embryo biopsy would not disadvantage a baby born using the technique. But pro-life groups are wary that the ruling could lead to a disturbing new era of eugenics.           Is the HFEA right to broaden its rules? Or should the laws be kept tight to stop the rise of the designer baby?          Send your views, including your name and where you live, to newsfeedback@telegraph.co.uk. A selection of your comments will be published throughout the day.         I have to ask the following questions:what percentage of births is managed this way?Why do some assume that the resultant baby will be treated like a bottle of pills, instead of as a welcome (as well as therapeutic) addition to the family?Isn’t it likely that the older child would be more inclined to treat the younger one who saved his/her life better?Just who is actually hurt by this procedure?Those who would inhibit human research, and the beneficial application of the results are missing the whole point of human achievements. It is only through our continuous quest for knowledge and understanding of the universe that we qualify to call ourselves “human”. Stem cell and related research and understanding will have beneficial results in ways that cannot yet be foreseen and applications such as this should never be inhibited unless harm can be clearly demonstrated. Perhaps the opponents of this activity would like to be living in the Middle Ages, without jet travel, nuclear power, telephones, radiology, cardiac stents.Peter Smith,Dunedin,  Florida                  As long as there is legislation to govern this type of intervention  (i.e. for the specific use of embryo screening and selection to cure sick babies) then the HFEA is right to make this decision.   My husband and I spent 13 months nursing a sick child and would have done anything within our power to save his life.   When potentially life-saving techniques such as this are about to be introduced by the medical services then legislation governing its use should be put in place immediately.  The implications of introducing this type of treatment are clear to the powers that be far in advance and, I am quite sure that this issue could and should have been resolved much sooner. To have your child die when there is nothing else to be done is one thing.  To have your child die when you know that there is a technique available which could potentially save his/her life and then have it denied to you is quite another. I suspect that the pro-life supporters who are against this have not had to sit in a paediatric intensive care ward for hours, days and weeks on end.  If they had and somebody had offered them a lifeline such as this to save their own child, I can promise you they would have taken it. Helen Green                  Designer babies are no better than Hitler's experiments, however better the desires are.Bryan McDonagh, St Albans                  It's all very well for Mr Thomas of Castleford to say that the New Testament tells of a baby born to save others.  The point he is missing is that God created one embryo to do this; he didn't create several and destroy the ones that weren't suitable.  A Brook, Gloucester                  Personally I find it rather amusing that Christian groups complain about a child being born with the purpose of saving others.  Perhaps they need to pause from their newspapers and read their New Testament instead. Philip Thomas,Castleford                  The ruling by the HFEA  to allow more screening and embryo selection is disrespectful to human life.No parent would fail to understand the desire to do everything possible to help a sick child, but such a relaxation of the rules will take us down a slippery slope where designer embryos will be created and destroyed for increasingly trivial reasons.The case of Joshua Fletcher crosses a line because in finding an embryo that could go on to become a blood stem cell donor, other normal embryos will be discarded purely because they are of the wrong tissue type.There is no doubt that the blood disorder Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA) is a serious and potentially fatal condition. However, current treatment using steroids, transfusion and chelation has made possible a median survival of over 30 years for DBA sufferers and treatments are improving all the time. Bone marrow transplant is also not without significant risk. But this sort of information rarely finds its way into the media's version of the story.Embryos are human beings worthy of the utmost respect and should not be treated as a means to an end. Moreover, it cannot be in the best interests of any donor child, however much they are subsequently loved, to be created for the primary purpose of providing transplant material for somebody else.The HFEA must guard against going beyond its remit. It should not be tinkering in this way with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. A full and proper parliamentary review is needed.Peter Saunders,General Secretary,Christian Medical Fellowship, London                  I'm strongly opposed to creating a child in order to use its tissue. It is disgraceful that the HFEA (unelected, unrepresentative and unaccountable) is taking it upon itself to inflict this on a child, especially when there are alternatives that do not involve creating a child in this way. We need to put more money into banking umbilical cord and also promote bone marrow donation from adults. I am on the bone marrow donor register and I would happily give tissue. I can give my consent. A tiny defenceless baby cannot.Fiona Pinto, Potters Bar, Hertfordshire                  I believe that parents who need a second child to provide stem cells for their first born will do so with or without this ruling, either by travelling abroad or having a baby without IVF and hoping that the two children are genetically compatible. Because of this the ruling will not change the viewpoints of the parents who have babies to help a sick siblings. Instead the ruling will avoid the situation where a baby is born only to find he/she is genetically incompatible with the sick sibling. However, I am strongly against screening embryos for anything but medical reasons. Children are people in their own right. Telling parents that they can customise children will put us on a slippery slope; the bottom is an age where children are fashion items that the parents can change whenever they feel like. B A Confino                  The HFEA decision is very wrong. We are treading on a slippery slope here. And every time a baby is 'selected' others of his siblings are discarded or kept for experimentation. Russell Baylis,Reading, Berkshire                  I believe that engineering babies whose cord stem cells could help cure siblings is a natural progression of medicine.  It causes the new child no harm and the parents are likely to love it that little bit extra because of the aid it has given to it's brother or sister. Jane Weitzmann,Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire                  If science can save life, it must be allowed to and specious moralisations should have no place in any discussion. Abortion is undoubtedly murder but as a society we have come to accept it - surely we must also accept the saving of life. I am not a religous person but it occurs to me that the HFEA has put itself in the position of the supreme being - having taken away, it now giveth. Preposterous pomposity. Janet, Spain                  A hard case makes bad law. The HFEA has shown itself unwilling or incapable of making ethical decisions and should therefore be disbanded and replaced. What won't they permit for so-called good reasons? This is the ultimate in utilitarianism: creating children because they are 'useful' and then destroying those other siblings deemed 'useless'. What a horror show. This is science as Might, as force of will alone.There is nothing 'designer' about children created in this way. They are merely cafeteria children; we select what we desire and disregard the rest. May God be merciful to us. James Stubbs, Coventry                  I have yet to see someone comment on what the effect will be on the child'designed' and born to help their sick sibling. This child will grow upknowing they were only there because someone needed their stem cells. Theymay well be loved but there will still be a part of them that will alwaysknow the real reason they were born - as a commodity, a cure, a medicinealmost. It will affect their lives, most probably in a negative fashion. Ican empathise with the parents of sick children and I don't know what I'd doif one of my two girls was sick, but a big part of me recoils from this sort ofeugenics. To coin a much overused phrase - it is but the thin end of thewedge.Nigel H, Bristol                  Disastrously wrong. Once again, a move whose main effect is on therights (or lack of them) of embryos is being presented as about therights of their parents. The HFEA has reviewed 'the risks to embryosfrom genetic screening'? One embryo in a dozen survives the process:that seems pretty risky.Benjamin, Oxford                  The proponents of 'designer babies' are generally those parents who have asick child that needs this type of transplant or those in the medicalprofession fascinated by tinkering with our biology. Whilst I sympathisewith the parents plight they are hardly in a position to make a reasonedjudgement. The scientists must also be checked by the moral judgments ofsociety, and check it we must. Once we start choosing embryos for aparticular purpose we have spoiled natural selection. This is the thin endof the wedge. The fat end says: 'But if we could just clone a left footedDavid Beckham then we'd have a more balanced England squad.'Peter Evans                  I am against the move. Babies should be brought into the world to be loved as individuals in their own right, not as a means of providing spare parts for others. How many foetuses will be cast aside as 'not suitable' before the 'matching' baby is produced?And what if the cell transplant from the new baby does not have the desired effect - will another baby be created for the same purpose? And another?It must be terrible to have a sick child and watch him or her deteriorate but I do not believe we have the right to create new life simply to prolong another's life in this way. A M,  Surrey                  The HFEA decision is very very wrong. Every time a baby is 'selected'  around 8 to 10 of his or her siblings are discarded/frozen or kept for experimentation. This is prejudice, slavery, eugenics. People in this field will make lots of money from the heartbreak of parents anxious to help their child but unaware of the emotional damage and moral bankruptcy of IVF techniques. Susan Boyle                  Yes I agree, those families with sick children are desperate, I truly believe they should be helped and not criticised for trying to help their child and obviously bring in another much loved child to a family.

telegraph,19/05/2008 18:57,news,"The Government has won the first round of its battle to allow scientists to create hybrid human-animal embryos after MPs voted in favour of radical stem cell research methods. During passionate exchanges in the House of Commons, pro-life campaigners   warned that the move created a dangerous precedent. But they were outnumbered by those who argued forcefully in favour of the   potential for stem cell research using hybrids, known as 'admixed human   embryos,' which scientists believe could transform the lives of   millions and eventually stamp out some diseases altogether. Tory MP Edward Leigh had led the cross-party bid to outlaw the creation of   human-animal embryos, arguing the technique was a 'step too far'. But the bill was defeated by 336 to 176 during a committee stage debate on the   Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill.The Commons then rejected a cross-party bid to ban the use of so called 'true   hybrids' - using the sex cells of a human and an animal. Voting was 286 to   223, majority 63. It was the first in a series of critical votes on emotive issues in committee   stage debate on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill - the biggest   shake-up of law in this area for 20 years. Britain is now set to become a world leader in stem cell research. Until now, scientists have been hampered by a lack of human eggs available for   research, but will now be able to boost stocks by creating embryos using   animal matter, mainly from cows and rabbits. The move had been heavily opposed by many religious leaders, including the   leader of the Catholic Church in Scotland, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, who   claimed such experiments amounted to 'Frankenstein' science, and   breached the sanctity of human life. But MPs including Gordon Brown and David Cameron, who both have young children   with severe medical conditions, agreed on a free vote that the benefits of   stem cell research using embryos were such that experiments, including the   use of human admixed embryos, should be allowed. Tonight's vote is the first in a series of highly-charged debates. The most   contentious vote, on whether to lower the legal abortion limit from 24   weeks, will come tomorrow evening. A coalition of Britain's leading medical charities had earlier urged MPs to   approve stem cell research using human-animal hybrid embryos. The open letter, whose signatories include the Parkinson's Disease Society and   the British Heart Foundation, said that allowing the creation of hybrid   embryos could lead to crucial advances in the treatment of a range of   serious diseases. Under the process, the nuclei of human cells are inserted into animal eggs,   creating hybrid embryos which are allowed to grow for a few days. Stem cells can then be harvested and used to create brain, skin, heart and   other tissue for treating diseases before the embryos are destroyed. Gordon Brown, whose youngest son suffers from cystic fibrosis, one of the   conditions which scientists hope may be treated as a result of the research,   launched a passionate defence of the Bill, on which Labour MPs have a free   vote. In an article in the Observer, he described the research as an 'inherently   moral endeavour', adding: 'I believe we owe it to ourselves and   future generations to introduce these measures.' Religious leaders were unified in their unhappiness over the Bill. In a joint statement, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor   and Cardinal Sean Brady said: 'Not nearly enough time has been given to   discussing these issues and these questions require answers before and not   after legislation. Other emerging techniques hold potential for good,   without creating and destroying human embryos.' "
telegraph,28/08/2002 14:03,news,"The Medical Research Council has warned that the opening of Britain's first stem cell bank will not lead to a 'free-for-all' in the use of human embryos for research.Plans for the store, which will hold stem cells from both embryos and adults, have been agreed in principle but are still awaiting ministerial approval. A presentation on the bank is expected to be given at a stem cell conference on September 11 but the MRC said that a statement on the launch of the bank was unlikely.Stem cells are 'mother' cells capable of developing into different kinds of tissue. Those extracted from early-stage embryos have the potential to turn into cells from any part of the body, including nerves, muscle, organs and bones.Doctors hope spare-part tissue made from stem cells will bring about a revolution in medicine, including new treatments for brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease, failed hearts and diabetes.The Medical Research Council, which is overseeing plans for the National Stem Cell Bank, strongly denied that the cell store would lead to more human embryos being destroyed for research.A spokesman said: 'The project is designed to ensure that there will be a resource that is properly regulated and run. It's designed so that once the stem cell bank is up and running, the number of embryos needed for research will be reduced, not increased. There's not going to be any kind of human embryo 'free-for-all'.'Tenders have been received from organisations hoping to run the bank, which would be operated without any vested commercial interest. A number of charities are thought to have expressed an interest.Couples who have undergone In-Vitro Fertilisation treatment will be invited to donate left over embryos from which to take stem cells. Those that are not used are currently just discarded, but they will only be kept with the full informed consent of the couples involved.British law allows scientists to conduct research on embryos up to 14 days old. At this stage an embryo is a small bundle of cells no bigger than a pin-head."
telegraph,15/01/2015 17:00,news,"The new discovery offers hope of a new treatment for skeletal disorders such as bone fractures, brittle bones, osteosarcoma or damaged cartilageBroken bones and torn cartilage could be fixed in a simple operation which   injects skeleton stem cells into damaged areas, scientists believe. Researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine have discovered which   stem cells give rise to bone, cartilage and bone marrow and how they work.They have even found a mechanism which allows fat cells to turn into skeleton   stem cells.The discovery offers the hope of a new treatment for skeletal disorders such   as bone fractures, brittle bones, osteosarcoma or damaged cartilage.'Millions of times a year, orthopedic surgeons see torn cartilage in a joint   and have to take it out because cartilage doesn't heal well, but that lack   of cartilage predisposes the patient to arthritis down the road,' said Dr   Michael Longaker, professor of plastic and reconstructive surgery at   Stanford and a senior author of the paper. 'This research raises the possibility that we can create new skeletal stem   cells from patients' own tissues and use them to grow new cartilage.'The scientists are hopeful that the breakthrough would allow missing bone   parts and cartilage to be grown in a lab and then transplanted, lowering the   chance of rejection. 'Right now, if you have lost a significant portion of your leg or jaw bones,   you have to borrow from Peter to pay Paul in that you have to cut another   bone like the fibula into the shape you need, move it and attach it to the   blood supply,' said Dr Longaker. 'But if your existing bone is not available or not sufficient, using this   research you might be able to put some of your own fat into a biomimetic   scaffold, let it grow into the bone you want in a muscle or fat pocket, and   then move that new bone to where it's needed.'Scientists are even hopeful that they could coax fat cells into becoming   skeleton stem cells which could then be injected into a damaged area during   a simple operation. It could be particularly useful in knee and hip   operations for the elderly and prevent arthritis.'The number of skeletal stem cells decreases dramatically with age, so bone   fractures or dental implants don't heal very well in the elderly because new   bone doesn't grow easily,” said lead author Dr Charles Chan.'But perhaps you will be able to take fat from the patient's body during   surgery, combine it with these reprogramming factors right there in the   operating room and immediately transplant new skeletal stem cells back into   the patient.'Although researchers have so far only mapped the skeletal stem cell system in   mice, they are confident that they will be able to do the same in humans. 'In this research we now have a Rosetta Stone that should help find the human   skeletal stem cells and decode the chemical language they use to steer their   development,' added Dr Chan. 'The pathways in humans should be very similar and share many of the major   genes used in the mouse skeletal system.'The research was published in the journal Cell."
telegraph,19/11/2008 17:01,comment,"The news from Barcelona and Bristol of a successful transplant using regenerative medicine is a significant development – not only for the patient herself and those similarly affected, but also because it serves as a proof of principle. It’s the first time we’ve seen full recovery from clinical surgery involving growth of cells around a scaffold.         The main benefit of this type of transplant is that using the patient’s own stem cells to generate the implant means the patient does not have to take drugs to suppress rejection of the new tissue. The operation, which took place some months ago, shows that the graft is being well tolerated without such drugs and that a blood supply to it has rapidly developed, which is crucial to its survival.         This single example demonstrates the huge potential of regenerative medicine and highlights the UK’s leading position in the field of stem cell science. This is not the end of the story, but rather encourages us to pursue projects in this area even more actively.         The Medical Research Council is currently encouraging proposals for collaborations to link the exciting progress in stem cell biology to clinicians working in areas where this technology can be applied. We are actively funding research to apply such techniques to hip and cartilage replacement at our research centres around the country. These types of bone marrow-derived stem cells are also being considered for MS therapies and stroke damage repair, where the first in-patient studies are underway, though we are still some way off devising treatments.         But this does not spell the end of embryonic stem cell research: different applications require varying approaches. At present, bone marrow-derived stem cells have shown only limited ability to provide the full range of cell types needed in regenerative medicine.     Embryonic stem cell research, which gave us a lot of the information necessary to get to this point, will enable us to make progress with more elaborate questions.         It may be far-fetched to think that we will ever see the complete regeneration of a complex organ like the heart or the liver for transplantation, but this news will spur on scientists working in the field and entice industry to invest more in this area. It certainly shows the importance of stem cell research and how much of an impact it may have on clinical practice. "
telegraph,27/12/2005 00:01,news,"The scandal over the fabrication of data purporting to show the cloning of human embryos deepened yesterday.          As South Korea's top university received some of the DNA test results that will be crucial for its investigation, the disgraced stem cell researcher Dr Hwang Woo-suk has implicated another scientist in the furore. Seoul National University commissioned the DNA tests to determine whether he ever created patient-matched stem cells via cloning, as he claimed in the journal Science.          On Friday, the panel said data on at least nine of 11 stem cell lines that Hwang claimed to create via cloned embryos were fabricated. The Yonhap news agency claimed in an unconfirmed report circulating yesterday that the DNA tests would not clear Hwang on the remaining two stem cell lines.          It has also emerged that Hwang  a petition with the Seoul central district prosecutor's office asking it to investigate whether his collaborators at MizMedi hospital replaced his therapeutic-cloning stem cells with samples from a fertility clinic.          He named Kim Sun-jong, a co-author of Hwang's 2005 paper, who played a key role in developing the purported patient-specific stem cells from cloned human embryos.          'Kim Sun-jong and others disturbed the work of establishing the patient-tailored embryonic stem cells, throwing it into utter confusion,' said the petition.          Kim, who now works at the University of Pittsburgh, flew to South Korea on Saturday and was questioned by a panel of experts at the university. He denied having replaced the cloned stem cells."
telegraph,1/6/2000 0:00,news,"THE scientist who is about to take over the stewardship of the nation's leading genetics centre last week described the challenges that remain in the biggest scientific and technological race since the drive to put a man on the Moon. The Wellcome Trust has announced the appointment of Prof Allan Bradley as the new director of the Sanger Centre in Cambridge, the laboratory at the forefront of the global effort to unlock the secrets of the human genetic code. Some say that cracking the human 'recipe', or genome, will be as momentous as the discovery that the Earth moves round the Sun.With genetic knowledge comes immense power. Once the human genome is decoded, it will begin to transform medicine, so that treatments can be customised to a person's genetic make-up. It will also transform human fertility, archaeology, genealogy and the whole of human society: in time, it is likely that we will begin to manipulate our genes to create designer babies, just as we are now altering the genes of plants and animals.Prof Bradley, 40, a Cambridge-educated geneticist, has been lured back from his post as head of a team of 40 scientists at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, to the genome campus around the 18th century manor house of Hinxton Hall, 10 miles outside Cambridge. After 13 years in America, he is returning to a very different climate in Britain, where the debate over GM crops and cloning has turned geneticists into pariahs.But Prof Bradley believes that the furore underlines the need for more openness, revealing more about public fears of the unknown rather than real scientific concerns. He relishes his appointment - 'even if Prince Charles does not approve' - as the project approaches an important milestone. It is already 85 per cent complete and the 90 per cent mark - the level declared to constitute a 'working draft' - will be reached in the middle of next month, at a cost of around £200 million.The final lap of the effort has turned into a race. On one side is the Sanger, at the hub of the publicly-funded Human Genome Project, which each night releases genome data free of charge on the internet. Its effort is running neck and neck with Celera, a private American company founded in 1998 which uses a 'fast and dirty' method to read the code for profit through licences and patents.This biological gold rush has been portrayed as an acrimonious battle between two men: Celera's Dr Craig Venter, the high school dropout and ex-surfer, and the British academic altruist Dr John Sulston of the Sanger. Prof Bradley, who will take over from Dr Sulston in October, has pledged to maintain the pressure on Celera.The Sanger is among the 16 genome centres around the world that have started phase two of the project, to 'fill in the gaps' in the sequence by increasing the overall sequence accuracy to 99.99 per cent in two years. But for Prof Bradley, reading the code simply marks the end of the beginning of the journey. Next comes the 'post-genomics era' - making sense of the code that resides in the 100 trillion cells in the human body.In the nucleus of each cell the code is contained in 46 volumes (chromosomes), 23 from the person's mother and 23 from the father. Those chromosomes are made of DNA, a long molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid, whose famous double helix shape was the greatest scientific discovery of the last century.There are 6ft of DNA in each human cell, a digital code that consists of four chemical letters - A, C, G and T - arranged into one billion three-letter words. All living things use essentially the same code, although some have more letters and some fewer. The three-letter words spell out genes. These in turn are the codes for proteins, molecules that can build the entire human body and produce everything from skin and bone to brain signals.The working draft has already allowed geneticists to find genes responsible for dozens of inherited diseases. Even in the past few days, the genome project has produced some surprises, including the suggestion that the total number of human genes may be closer to 40,000 than the previous estimates of 70,000-140,000. Prof Bradley said: 'The opportunities for scientific discoveries have never been greater.'     Roger Highfield will host Electronic Telegraph's Ask a Journalist feature on June 10 at 1300 GMT.

Co-laureate American H. Robert Horvitz was also cited in the announcement in Stockholm, Sweden, home of the Nobel prizes.The prize, which has the official title 'for medicine or physiology', is worth about £650,000.All three men were recognised for their discoveries concerning 'genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death'. Their work, which hinged around studies of a tiny nematode worm, identified key genes regulating organ development and the programmed death of cells.It gave rise to discoveries which shed new light on the development of many diseases, including Aids, neurodegenerative disorders, and strokes and provided new insights into genetics.Sir John led the 500-strong Sanger Centre team which, as part of the international Human Genome Project, sequenced a third of the human genome - the complex pattern of chemicals that makes up our DNA. Part of the genome consists of genes which contain all the coded instructions for creating a human being.Publication of the first working draft of the human genome two years ago marked a milestone in science and turned the unassuming John Sulston - then plain Dr Sulston - into a celebrity.Sir John believed passionately that the human genome information should be freely available to everyone, putting him at odds with rival American gene-mapper Craig Venter.After a bitterly fought race, the Human Genome Project and Venter's company Celera Genomics, of Rockville, Maryland, finally unveiled their respective versions of the genome together on June 26, 2000."

It is believed GE (genetic editing) may be more appetising to consumers than   traditional GM (genetic modification) and cause less controversy.It involves subtly ''tweaking'' existing genes to increase or reduce amounts   of natural ingredients a vegetable or fruit already has.The technique avoids the insertion of foreign genes that has sparked so much   heated debate and criticism, especially in Europe.Bananas could, for instance, be genetically edited to produce more vitamin A,   and apples to avoid browning when cut.''The simple avoidance of introducing foreign genes makes genetically edited   crops more 'natural' than transgenic crops obtained by inserting foreign   genes,'' said Dr Chidananda Kanchiswamy from the Agricultural Institute of   San Michele in Italy.Dr Kanchiswamy and colleagues explore the potential of GE fruit in an article   published in the journal Trends in Biotechnology.To date, most genetically altered fruit crops have been developed using a   plant bacterium to carry foreign genes into their DNA.Of these, only GM papaya has been commercialised, partly because of strict   regulations in the European Union, said the researchers.But it was possible that GE plants whose existing genes have been deleted or   altered might even be considered non-genetically modified by regulators.Dr Kanchiswamy added: ''We would like people to understand that crop breeding   through biotechnology is not restricted only to GMO (genetically modified   organisms).''Transfer of foreign genes was the first step to improve our crops, but GEOs   will surge as a 'natural' strategy to use biotechnology for a sustainable   agricultural future.''Genetic editing has become more of a practical solution due to new   technologies such as CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short   Palindromic Repeats) that make it easier to ''cut and paste'' sections of   DNA.The researchers wrote: ''Combining the increased knowledge of the genomes   (genetic codes) of a range of fruit crops with novel DNA-editing   technologies will produce new fruit crop varieties with a range of novel   traits.''Such varieties could confer increased expression of desirable aromatics or   sweetness, as well as contributing to a more sustainable mode of   cultivation, such as pest and disease-resistant phenotypes.''"
telegraph,1/3/2015 13:16,news,"The treatment, is the first to reverse the symptoms of MS, which has no cure, and affects around 100,000 people in Britain. A pioneering new stem cell treatment is allowing multiple sclerosis sufferers to walk, run and even dance again, in results branded ‘miraculous’ by doctors.  Patients who have been wheelchair-bound for 10 years have regained the use of their legs in the groundbreaking therapy, while others who were blind can now see again.  The treatment, is the first to reverse the symptoms of MS, which has no cure, and affects around 100,000 people in Britain.  The two dozen patients who are taking part in the trials at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield and Kings College Hospital, London, have effectively had their immune systems ‘rebooted’.  Although it is unclear what causes MS, some doctors believe that it is the immune system itself which attacks the brain and spinal cord, leading to inflammation and pain, disability and in severe cases, death.  In the new treatment, specialists use a high dose of chemotherapy to knock out the immune system before rebuilding it with stem cells taken from the patient’s own blood.  Stem cells are so effective because they can become any cell in the body based on their environment.  'Since we started treating patients three years ago, some of the results we have seen have been miraculous,' Professor Basil Sharrack, a consultant neurologist at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, told The Sunday Times.  'This is not a word I would use lightly, but we have seen profound neurological improvements.'  During the treatment, the patient's stem cells are harvested and stored. Then doctors use aggressive drugs which are usually given to cancer patients to completely destroy the immune system.  The harvested stem cells are then infused back into the body where they start to grow new red and white blood cells within just two weeks.  Within a month the immune system is back up and running fully and that is when patients begin to notice that they are recovering.  Holly Drewry, 25, of Sheffield, was wheelchair bound after the birth of her daughter Isla, now two.  But she claims the new treatment has transformed her life.  “It worked wonders,” she said. “I remember being in the hospital... after three weeks, I called my mum and said: 'I can stand'. We were all crying.  'I can run a little bit, I can dance. I love dancing, it is silly but I do. I enjoy walking my daughter around the park in her pram. It is a miracle but I can do it all.'  However specialists warn that patients need to be fit to benefit from the new treatment.  'This is not a treatment that is suitable for everybody because it is very aggressive and patients need to be quite fit to withstand the effects of the chemotherapy,' warned Prof Sharrack.  Charities welcomed the research but also urged caution.  Dr Sorrel Bickley, Research Communications Manager at the MS Society said: “This new study reports very encouraging findings, which add to a growing body of research into stem cell transplantation in MS. However, there are limitations to how we can interpret these results because there was no control group used, which means we can’t be sure the results are robust.  'Momentum in this area of research is building rapidly and we're eagerly awaiting the results of larger, randomised trials and longer term follow up data.  “New treatments for MS are urgently needed, but as yet there are no stem cell therapies licensed for MS anywhere in the world. This means they aren't yet established as being both safe and effective. This type of stem cell therapy is very aggressive and does carry significant risks, so we would strongly urge caution in seeking this treatment outside of a properly regulated clinical trial.'  The research was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. "
telegraph,2/5/2007 0:01,news,"The world's first attempt to treat blindness by transplanting genes into the eye has started in London.         A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital has begun the pioneering attempt to treat a sight disorder using gene therapy.         Yesterday they disclosed they had carried out genetic surgery a few weeks ago on Robert Johnson, a civil servant based in London who was born with a sight disorder which deteriorates with age.         Mr Johnson, who had genes inserted into just one eye, can see outlines during the day, but little at night.         However, it will be months before the researchers know whether the cutting-edge technique has worked.         'It's very difficult to say how I'm feeling. I keep ranging from extreme nervousness to a bit of excitement,' Mr Johnson, 23, told the BBC.         If this gene therapy is successful scientists believe that the technology could be adapted to treat a range of sight disorders, such as age-related macular degeneration, one of the most common causes of blindness.         The trial, which has received funding from the Department of Health, involves a dozen adults and children who have a condition called Leber's congenital amaurosis which affects one in 100,000 babies. Sight deteriorates to such a degree that many sufferers go blind as adults. The culprit is a gene called RPE65, which stops the retina, the layer of cells at the back of the eye that detect light, from working.         Lead researcher, Prof Robin Ali, based at the Institute of Ophthalmology, has spent 15 years working with colleagues developing the technique.         He said: 'I can't help feeling somewhat apprehensive,' he said. 'There is so much riding on it and we have all been waiting for a very long time.'         His colleague, James Bainbridge, injected the normal genes to the retina, using a harmless virus or 'vector' to slip the gene into the cells.         The operation, which took three hours, required great precision as Mr Johnson's retina was detached to allow the virus to infect the cells.         Robert Maclaren, the assistant surgeon, said he was pleased with how the procedure went.         The technique has been successful in the lab and on animals. Dogs that had the defect had their sight improved so much that they could walk through a maze alone.         The team includes retinal specialist Prof Tony Moore, who said: 'Some indications of the results of the trial may be available within several months.         'However, the subjects will need to be followed up to assess the long-term effect of the treatment. We anticipate the best outcome in younger patients, as we will be treating the disease in the early stages of its development.'         Health minister Lord Hunt said: 'This trial is a global first of its kind and could mean the ability to restore sight to children with this condition. The UK leads Europe in gene therapy, with over 40 per cent of clinical trials, and we are second only to the US.'         Prof Leonard Seymour, president of the British Society for Gene Therapy, said: 'These early trials are really aiming to slow down deterioration of vision.         He added: 'It is only by performing clinical studies such as these that we can identify what we need to do to correct the problem altogether.'         Prof Martin Gore, chairman of the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee, which approved the procedure, said: 'Gene therapy was conceived for the treatment of single-gene disorders.         'In practice, more than 70 per cent of gene therapy trials have been for cancer. This trial demonstrates that the original ideas behind gene therapy are still very much alive.'"
telegraph,23/11/2007 00:01,news,"Thousands of patients with arthritis and multiple sclerosis are given new hope today by scientists who have developed a way to alter the immune system.         Both conditions are caused when the immune system becomes faulty and attacks the body. Scientists have discovered that by injecting stem cells, the body's building blocks, taken from a healthy donor into the patient they can effectively transplant the donor's immune system and cure the condition.         Until now, such a transplant would have been possible only by giving the patient aggressive treatments such as radiotherapy to wipe out the faulty immune system before carrying out a bone marrow transplant to provide new cells.         But under the new system patients would be treated with a toxin to clear out the old immune system before being injected with healthy stem cells that would form a new immune system.         The procedure has been performed only on mice but the researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine in California said the 'benefits are potentially huge' for humans and could be used to treat MS and rheumatoid arthritis.         The development brings hope to the 85,000 in Britain living with MS and the one in five people suffering from arthritis.         Prof Weissman, Dr Deepta Bhattacharya and Agnieszka Czechowicz carried out the research, which is reported today in the journal Science. When the team transplanted new, blood-forming stem cells into the mice, they became attached to the bone marrow and established a new blood and immune system.         In this way, stem cells can be taken from a donor and implanted into a person with a good tissue match who has an auto-immune disease, such as multiple sclerosis, so that the new immune system will no longer attack the nerves of the body.         First, the researchers need to do more animal testing and then to develop a way to carry out the same kind of surgical strike on human blood-­forming cells.         Dr Laura Bell, the research communications officer at the MS Society, said: 'Stem-cell studies are an important avenue of research that hold promise in terms of treatments for MS. This early-stage study is interesting and we look forward to seeing how the work translates into studies in people with MS.'         Prof Edward Tuddenham, of the Royal Free Hospital, London, said: 'For those whose blood stem cells contain a severe genetic defect such as that causing sickle cell anaemia, replacing them with normal stem cells would enable restoration of normal blood.         'Bone marrow transplantation has been used for sickle cell anaemia with good results in children, but in adults it is difficult to get the new stem cells to take in the face of rejection by the resident stem cells and their progeny - the immune system.'         Prof Lars Fugger, of the Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit, Oxford University, said: 'This study has great potential.'"
telegraph,17/03/2011 00:01,news,"Thousands of sufferers of degenerative brain diseases have been given new hope by a study showing that gene therapy can improve movement in patients with Parkinson’s.The innovative treatment, in which genes are injected directly into the brain,   was found to be safe in the first proper clinical trial and led to   improvements in the condition for people who did not respond to drugs. It is hoped that the therapy could be developed eventually to treat sufferers   of other brain conditions such as Alzheimer’s, as well as helping the   120,000 people in Britain alone who have Parkinson’s disease. Dr Matthew During, of Ohio State University, described the results as “great   news” and added: “Since this is also the first gene therapy study for a   neurological disease to achieve success in a rigorous randomized,   double-blind design compared with a sham group, this is also a crucial step   forward toward finally bringing gene therapy into clinical practice for   patients with debilitating brain disorders.”However experts have cautioned that the successful trial only involved a small   number of patients, and may not represent an improvement on existing   treatments. Dr Michelle Gardner, research development manager at the charity Parkinson’s   UK, said: “This research shows the promise of gene therapy for neurological   conditions like Parkinson's. But further research is still needed. “We still don't know for how long the benefits of this treatment may last or   whether there may be long-term problems due to introducing viruses into the   brain. “In addition, any new treatment must be shown to be more effective than those   currently available for Parkinson's, which this treatment has not yet been   shown to be.”Parkinson’s, suffered by the former boxing champion Muhammad Ali and the actor   Michael J Fox, develops when levels of important chemicals in the brain   drop, and when protein deposits in the brain develop. It affects the ability to walk and eat while existing drugs can cause   side-effects such as involuntary movements. One current treatment, called Deep Brain Stimulation, involves patients being   fitted with an electronic device that blocks the nerve signals that cause   tremors. But four years ago, scientists in New York disclosed a “milestone” in treating   the disease as well as other degenerative conditions by injecting genes. A small group of patients was injected with billions of copies of a   genetically altered virus, into a part of the brain called the subthalamic   nucleus. The virus contained the human gene for an enzyme called glutamic acid   decarboxylase (GAD) that helps to make a chemical lacking in Parkinson’s   sufferers, called GABA. In the initial trial, the patients’ brain cells started to make the GABA   chemical and were later found to have greatly improved mobility. In the first randomised double-blind study of the gene therapy, reported in The   Lancet Neurology on Thursday, 22 patients had the virus injected into   their brains along with 23 who received a placebo. Using an established scale to assess their mobility up to six months later,   researchers at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, New York, found   that those who had the gene therapy saw a 23.1 per cent improvement in their   motor function compared with 12.7 in the placebo group. The only “mild” side-effects noted were headache and nausea. Dr Thomas Foltynie, a Senior Lecturer & Honorary Consultant Neurologist at   the Institute of Neurology, London, said: 'This is the first double-blind   randomised, controlled gene therapy trial in Parkinson’s patients and the   fact that there are some positive results is most welcome encouragement for   Parkinson’s patients. 'The size of the improvement remains quite modest compared with what can be   achieved using conventional Deep Brain Stimulation of the subthalamic   nucleus and by six months, no improvement in the quality of life of the   patients was detected. 'This type of gene therapy treatment may however yet develop into a valuable   new approach at alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. 'But it requires ongoing evaluation of its effectiveness, safety, convenience   and cost in order for it to gain any perceived advantage over the existing   medical and surgical treatments for Parkinson’s patients.'

telegraph,30/01/2013 19:00,news,"Tuberculosis can 'lurk' in patients' bone marrow where it is protected from drugs, according to a study which could explain why the disease often recurs years after treatment.Taking antibiotics can spare sufferers the symptoms of tuberculosis, but   doctors have never been able to prevent the condition resurfacing years or   decades after the initial therapy. Now researchers from Stanford University have discovered that the disease is   capable of 'infiltrating' cells in bone marrow which may protect   it from treatments. The cells have qualities like a natural resistance to drugs, infrequent   division and a privileged immune status which could allow them to survive   various types of treatment, the scientists explained. In a study published in the Science Translational Medicine journal, the   researchers reported that they had found active tuberculosis bacteria in the   cells of human patients who had been treated for the disease. It is possible that a host of other infectious diseases may use a similar 'wolf-in-stem-cell-clothing'   tactic to hide away from therapies, they suggested, although any new   treatments will take many years to develop. Traces of the bacteria were identified in mesenchymal stem cells, which can   produce specialised cell types including bone, fat and cartilage. Although the stem cells are typically found in the bone marrow they are also   capable of moving to the lungs – the ideal environment for tuberculosis   bacteria. After testing their theory on mice in a previous study, the researchers   carried out a small clinical trial in India where bone marrow biopsies were   taken from nine patients who had been treated for tuberculosis and who had   no traces of the bacteria in their respiratory tract. In eight of the nine patients, bacterial DNA could still be found in bone   marrow stem cells, and in two of these cases living bacteria were found. Dr Bikul Das, lead author of the study, said: 'Not only is this strong   evidence that the tuberculosis can remain dormant in stem cells, but it   shows that the living bacteria could be recovered from these cells after a   long period of time.  'It's also very suggestive of how the reactivation could be triggered:   These stem cells are known to migrate to sites of injury or inflammation and   begin dividing. So, migrating stem cells harbouring dormant bacteria might   reactivate the disease in the lung.' Dr Dean Felsher, co-senior author, added: 'Other infectious agents might   use stem cells in a similar manner. We'd like to further characterise   whether and how these stem cells provide a protective niche for other   infectious agents.' "
dailymail,14/05/2015 21:27,wires,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Agriculture Department has developed a new government certification and labeling for foods that are free of genetically modified ingredients.USDA's move comes as some consumer groups push for mandatory labeling of the genetically modified organisms, or GMOs.The certification is the first of its kind, would be voluntary — and companies would have to pay for it. If approved, the foods would be able to carry a 'USDA Process Verified' label along with a claim that they are free of GMOs.Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack outlined the new certification in a May 1 letter to USDA employees, saying it was being done at the request of a 'leading global company,' which he did not identify. A copy of the letter was obtained by The Associated Press.A USDA spokesman confirmed that Vilsack sent the letter but declined to comment on the certification program. Vilsack said in the letter that the certification 'will be announced soon, and other companies are already lining up to take advantage of this service.'Companies can already put their own GMO-free labels on foods, but there are no government labels that only certify a food as GMO-free. Many companies use a private label developed by a nonprofit called the Non-GMO Project. The USDA organic label also certifies that foods are free of genetically modified ingredients, but many non-GMO foods aren't organic.Vilsack said the USDA certification is being created through the department's Agriculture Marketing Service, which works with interested companies to certify the accuracy of the claims they are making on food packages — think 'humanely raised' or 'no antibiotics ever.' Companies pay the Agricultural Marketing Service to verify a claim, and if approved, they can market the foods with the USDA process verified label.'Recently, a leading global company asked AMS to help verify that the corn and soybeans it uses in its products are not genetically engineered so that the company could label the products as such,' Vilsack wrote in the letter. 'AMS worked with the company to develop testing and verification processes to verify the non-GE claim.'Genetically modified foods come from seeds that are originally engineered in laboratories to have certain traits, like resistance to herbicides. The majority of the country's corn and soybean crop is now genetically modified, with much of that going to animal feed. GMO corn and soybeans are also made into popular processed food ingredients like high-fructose corn syrup and soybean oil.The government says GMOs on the market now are safe so mandatory labels aren't needed. Consumer advocates pushing for mandatory labeling say shoppers still have a right to know what is in their food, arguing that not enough is known about the effects of the technology. They have supported several state efforts to require labeling, with the eventual goal of having a federal mandatory label set by the Food and Drug Administration.An Associated Press-GfK poll in December showed that two thirds of Americans support the labeling, while fewer said genetically modified ingredients are important in judging whether a food is healthy. Some of the respondents said their support of labeling was more about accountability in the food industry than the safety of GMOs.Vermont became the first state to require the labeling in 2014, and that law will go into effect next year if it survives a legal challenge from the food industry.The USDA label is similar to what is proposed in a GOP House bill introduced earlier this year that is designed to block such mandatory GMO labeling efforts around the country. The bill, introduced by Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., provides for voluntary USDA certification and would override any state laws that require the labeling. The food industry has strongly backed Pompeo's bill, arguing labels would be misleading because GMOs are safe.Rep. Pompeo said USDA's move shows his approach is gathering support.'I look forward to working with the secretary and with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that we come to the best possible policy to provide families in Kansas and America with clarity at the grocery store affordable and abundant food supply,' he said.Consumer advocates who are pushing for mandatory labeling say the voluntary USDA labels aren't sufficient to help consumers know what is in their food.Colin O'Neil of the Center for Food Safety said claiming a food is free of GMOs 'is not enough to remedy widespread consumer confusion and therefore cannot be a substitute for mandatory disclosure.'___Follow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick"
telegraph,19/11/2008 14:48,news,"Woolly mammoths could once again roam the Earth after scientists unlocked the complete genetic makeup of the extinct animal. Researchers have managed to reconstruct the entire DNA of the former species in a world breakthrough that could also lead to a similar feat for the Dodo and Neanderthal man.Now they believe they could implant the genetic code into the egg of its closest relative - the African elephant - and resurrect the species which died out around 4,500 years ago.The team at Pennsylvania State university re-constructed the animal's entire 'genome' after extracting DNA from the hairs of two mammoths buried in the Siberian permafrost for more than 20,000 years.While the extreme cold conditions help preserve the DNA code, the strands had been damaged over time.The scientists filled in the gaps by comparing it to the DNA of the African elephant which they estimate is more than 99.7 per cent identical to its distant ancestor, or twice as close as humans and chimpanzees.Stephan Schuster, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology and the project co-leader, said the discovery could give clues to why the mammoth became extinct while elephants survived - and could lead to their resurrection.'By deciphering this genome we could, in theory, generate data that one day may help other researchers to bring the woolly mammoth back to life by inserting the uniquely mammoth DNA sequences into the genome of the modern-day elephant,' he said. 'This would allow scientists to retrieve the genetic information that was believed to have been lost when the mammoth died out, as well as to bring back an extinct species that modern humans have missed meeting by only a few thousand years.'Previous attempts to sequence the DNA of extinct animals have only produced fragmented results but techniques and computer analysis have greatly improved over the last few years.'Our dataset is 100 times more extensive than any other published dataset for an extinct species, demonstrating that ancient DNA studies can be brought up to the same level as modern genome projects,' said Professor Schuster.The genome consists of more than four-billion DNA strands , only 3.3 billion of them - a little over the size of the human genome - currently can be assigned to the mammoth genome, said the researchers.Some of the remaining DNA bases may belong to the mammoth, but others could belong to other organisms, like bacteria and fungi, from the surrounding environment that had contaminated the sample. The team used a draft version of the African elephant's genome, which currently is being generated by scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, to distinguish those sequences that truly belong to the mammoth from possible contaminants.They showed that woolly mammoths are more closely related to modern-day elephants than previously was believed.'Our data suggests that mammoths and modern-day elephants separated around six million years ago, about the same time that humans and chimpanzees separated,' said Webb Miller, professor of biology and of computer science and engineering and co-author of the report in Nature.The team's new data also provide additional evidence that woolly mammoths had low genetic diversity. 'We discovered that individual woolly mammoths were so genetically similar to one another that they may have been especially susceptible to being wiped out by a disease, by a change in the climate, or by humans,' said Prof Schuster.

telegraph,28/06/2003 00:01,news,"     A British team of doctors is about to pass another medical milestone by treating children with an inherited disorder of the immune system using gene therapy.The plan to transplant genes into five children is significant because it marks a renewed attempt to treat ADA deficiency, called bubble baby syndrome because victims must be protected in a sterile environment. The syndrome was targeted in the world's first gene therapy trials, all of which failed.The Great Ormond Street team in London is one of only three worldwide to have reported success with the therapy, among hundreds of failed attempts, after it used gene transplants to treat four children who had another form of immune deficiency. Despite concerns, raised when gene therapy was linked to two cases of leukaemia, Prof Adrian Thrasher and Dr Bobby Gaspar remain confident about the future of transplanting 'healthy' genes to replace defective DNA.Compared with the first organ transplants, the first gene transplants have been highly regulated and proved remarkably safe - more so than alternative treatments available to these seriously ill children, they said.Boys and girls who have the bubble baby disease lack the gene for an enzyme called adenosine deaminase (ADA) so they suffer abnormalities of the immune system, a 'severe combined immunodeficiency' or SCID.In the wake of success by Italian doctors, the London team is to launch an ADA trial on children who cannot find a bone marrow donor with a good tissue match and who do not respond well to PEG-ADA, a drug used to replace the missing enzyme.Boys and girls have yet to be recruited for the trial, in which bone marrow will be extracted and mingled in sterile blood bags with a genetically engineered mouse virus containing a normal copy of the ADA gene.Before the doctors transfuse the modified bone marrow back into each child, they will take a radical step, neglected in earlier attempts, now thought crucial: they will end treatment with PEG-ADA and subject the children to mild chemotherapy to suppress defective bone marrow cells and, in effect, 'create space' for the transfused GM cells to multiply.Because of the leukaemia problem, the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee has insisted that approval must be sought for each of the five children.All had their immune systems wrecked by a defect in, or lack of, the 'gamma c' gene. The first transplant patient, Rhys Evans, remains healthy with no signs of the inherited disorder that had confined him to the solitary world of an antiseptic hospital room.However, problems have been identified by Prof Alain Fischer of the Necker Hospital, Paris, who has used a similar approach on 11 X-SCID children. Two developed leukaemia, a known risk given that the virus used for gene therapy can disrupt genes by inserting a new one.However, the two children are now in remission and gene therapy still provides a safer alternative to bone marrow transplants from a parent or mismatched unrelated donor, said Prof Thrasher.'We would have expected four or five deaths if we had taken that approach,' he said. 'Gene therapy is not a tragedy at all but an incredible new treatment. We know there are problems but, as with any new therapy, we will learn how to rectify them.'Although the trial follows a cash boost announced this week in a White Paper, it will still mostly be funded by charities, notably the Jeans for Genes appeal. The Government has given some support to the ADA study but allocated only £3 million for all 4,000 of what are called 'single gene' disorders."
telegraph,25/01/2001 00:00,news,"     READERS will remember the dark eyes of ANDi, the world's first genetically modified monkey, gazing up at them from this newspaper recently.                               Designer monkey: is the genetic modification of animals in general, and primates in particular, morally justifiable?          After several failed attempts to insert jellyfish genes into rhesus monkeys, ANDi - 'inserted DNA' in reverse - was created at the Oregon Regional Primate Research Center in America. ANDi's case has attracted worldwide interest because of its implications for the manufacture of 'designer babies': genetically modified humans, created from a shopping list of desirable characteristics. Other GM animals already exist, but the modification of primates brings the possibility of similar experiments on humans much closer.Ever since Aldous Huxley's Brave New World appeared nearly 70 years ago, thoughtful people have been haunted by his vision of a dystopian society of laboratory-bred human robots. Until the Nazis gave eugenics a bad name, many intellectuals in Britain and America supported the idea. Now the genetic revolution has made eugenics respectable again. Scientists at the cutting edge of genetic research are often invited to defend their work, but we hear less often from philosophers. Theirs, however, is the task of assessing the meaning of such research.The Telegraph asked seven of the world's leading philosophers a number of questions arising from the ANDi case. Is the genetic modification of animals in general, and primates in particular, morally justifiable? Will such research inevitably be extended to humans and, if so, would that be wrong? Should there be any ethical limitations on the use of such research for eugenic purposes, as opposed to purely medical ones? If animal species are genetically modified on a large scale, are there likely to be unforeseen consequences? Is such modification compatible with our duty as custodians of the animal kingdom?All these questions boil down to this: do we really know what we are doing and where it is leading? Experts disagree about the future as much as laymen. Philosophers, as Sir Michael Dummett points out, are not prophets. But it is clear that most of these thinkers find what Richard Rorty calls 'freaky experiments', such as ANDi, more or less disturbing.The main exception is John Harris, whose scientific background and role as a government adviser gives him a very different perspective. He welcomes a future in which humans may live for hundreds of years. At the other end of the spectrum, Roger Scruton is appalled by this prospect, while Leszek Kolakowski, who has first-hand experience of hi-tech barbarism in communist Eastern Europe, fears that a brave new world may be just around the corner.The two American professors, Noam Chomsky and Richard Rorty, are more reluctant to criticise scientists. Sir Michael Dummett has no qualms about the use of primates, but raises the important issue of inequality. Designer babies may be all very well for the rich, but there is little possibility of the vast majority of the world's population benefiting from such technology. Sir Michael will not be the only person to find the spectre of a genetically modified master race 'repugnant'.     Noam Chomsky Professor Noam Chomsky, 72, who teaches linguistics and philosophy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, has argued that children are born with an innate understanding of grammar. Professor Chomsky last week said: 'We are getting to the point where serious questions arise about tampering with the living world. We have to consider whether these genetic modifications are in a fact a form of torture for these animals.' 'There are two kinds of questions we have to ask. Firstly, is it something we can significantly benefit from? That is not something I feel qualified to answer. 'Secondly, is it possibly a step towards dealing with serious health problems for humans? I think it is and this kind of work should not be wiped out. But there should be more controls and serious evaluations. Giving a person an aspirin and giving them genetic modification are far different things. It's a matter of gradation. But I suppose we should remember that we had exactly the same fears about advanced medicines and psychotherapy.'     Michael Ball Professor Michael Ball, 62, a lecturer in medical cell biology, is chairman of Frame, the Fund for Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments, and an opponent of testing on animals. He said: 'The experiment on this monkey is obscene, ethically unjustified and scientifically unnecessary. It is time somebody called the bluff of these people every time they say they have made a new step forward. The idea that they can resolve every disease under the sun and make us live for 2,000 years is ridiculous. The extremely low rate of success in scientific terms does not justify the animal suffering involved. These primate centres in America are all looking for work to do to justify their existence.'     Sir Michael Dummett Professor Sir Michael Dummett, 75, former Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford University, said: 'I don't have any objections to using monkeys. They are animals - I don't think we should give them the vote. However, I don't think we should have an arrangement by which parents decide what children they want. That would not be a happy state of affairs because the rich would have magnificent babies and the poor would have to put up with what God sends. I'm not a prophet, but it goes without saying that some scientists are going to be able to do many repugnant things. We have to give that critical consideration.'     Leszek Kolakowski Professor Leszek Kolakowski, 73, is a leading philosopher at Oxford University who escaped from Poland in 1968 and whose writings contributed to the downfall of communism. He believes that 's big threat is biotechnology and genetic manipulation: 'I am afraid it will lead into experimentation on humans, not in civilised countries but in countries which are technically developed but not civilised, like China. I understand the medical reasons for such experiments. It is clear that genetic manipulation can be done on primates but what the capability of these hereditary changes are might well be impossible to predict. We could develop monsters. '     John Harris Professor John Harris, lecturer in bioethics at Manchester University, is a member of the Government's human genetics commission and author of Clones, Genes and Immortality. He said: 'There are two issues. The ethics of modifying genes of humans and the ethics of preparing the way to do that by using primates. We should be sparing on our use of primates because they are so very nearly persons themselves.' Professor Harris, 54, an atheist who has advocated that corpses should become public property to make up for the shortage in transplant organs, added: 'In a way, we are all genetically modified already. Evolution is a mechanism for genetic modification but it is not a particularly efficient one. We are already genetically modified creatures. If we can modify genes to protect ourselves from harm it is much better than leaving it to evolution. 'Evolution has done a very mixed job for humans. It has left a pool of diseases that have created untold misery. We may be able to engineer resistance to diseases that may have a big affect on life expectancy, allowing people to live hundreds of years longer. Of course, that is a long way in the future. I don't think there is anything wrong in principle with designer babies. If we can improve intelligence, that would cut out spending a huge amount of money on education.'     Richard Rorty Professor Richard Rorty, 69, is a leading American philosopher and lecture at Stanford University, California. He has been called the most controversial but accessible philosopher since Bertrand Russell and made his reputation with Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature. He said: 'All kinds of problems are going to emerge out of these experiments. I think you can write science fiction situations where all natural species are disappearing and are replaced by artificial species made to human tastes. But this is not a reason to stop research that has given us cures to viruses as well as the possibility of biological warfare. You can pass all kinds of laws in the absence of global legislation but I still expect all kinds of freaky experiments in the world. Lots of people are thinking as hard as they can about these issues and it's hard to put your finger on many of them. It's disturbing - but lots of change in science is disturbing.'     Roger Scruton Roger Scruton, 56, is Britain's best known writer on philosophy and a former professor at Birkbeck College, London, and Boston University. He said: 'It is perhaps unfair to draw the comparison with Dr Mengele of Auschwitz, but it is certainly true that the new breed of medical researchers proceeds as though any reference to moral absolutes, or to the sanctity of life, is merely a quaint survival of a discredited view of the human condition. I have this horrible vision of a future in which there are no young people any more, except those manufactured by the bionic geriatrics who control things; those who use all the resources of the Earth, including those that belong by right to future generations, to outstay their welcome on a planet whose resources they devote entirely to themselves.'   "
telegraph,23/04/2003 00:01,news,"    The European Parliament has voted to ban therapeutic cloning while researchers have run into a brick wall, reports Science Editor Roger Highfield       Britain's plans to become the leading light in research on cloned human embryos has suffered two major blows in the past few days, one from scientists investigating whether it will ever be possible and the other from Catholic and Christian Democrat Euro MPs.Two years ago, Parliament voted to allow strictly regulated 'therapeutic cloning' of human embryos because this offers a way to isolate stem, or parent, cells to make any tissue type for a vast range of novel treatments. In his Budget statement, Gordon Brown even referred to how Britain was investing £40 million over two years to become the 'world leader in stem cell research'.Now Britain is on a collision course with the European Parliament, which voted this month to adopt more than 80 amendments to a European Commission proposal to set quality and safety standards for human tissues and cells. The Christian Right initiative had the effect of hijacking safety legislation to outlaw therapeutic cloning and severely restrict research on human embryonic stem cells.No politician or credible scientist backs the idea of reproductive cloning, where the 'nuclear transfer' technique developed by Prof Ian Wilmut and colleagues to create Dolly the sheep would be used to create a genetic copy of a person. However, the debate over therapeutic cloning has been less clear cut and seen a vitriolic clash between pragmatists who champion the rights of patients and pro-life fundamentalists who champion the rights of embryos.The embryo in question is smaller than the full stop at the end of this sentence, a far cry from the popular image of an embryo, depicted as a comma, and certainly nothing like a foetus, which only begins to develop after the embryo is implanted in a woman's uterus. Given the technical name of a blastocyst, it consists of 100 cells: around 75 are destined to become the placenta, and the remaining 25 make up the 'inner cell mass', part of which will form the stem cells of the embryo that can, in theory, turn into any cell from the body.Thus, if the embryo has been cloned by replacing the genes in an egg with those from a patient, its stem cells could be turned into brain, nerve, muscle or cells of any desired type for treatments, without any risk of rejection. Fashioning them into tissues and organs is a distant prospect, but these cells alone could revolutionise the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, stroke, spinal cord injuries, heart disease and diabetes.The creation of embryos for this purpose is deemed immoral by Catholic and Christian Democrat MEPs, who emphasise that there are adult sources of stem cells and that human life starts at the moment of fertilisation: a blastocyst is a person. 'From the moment of conception, you create all the individual characteristics of a person,' said Marialiese Flemming, the Austrian Christian Democrat who tabled the amendments.Pragmatists reply that the potential of an egg fertilised in the lab is limited: it will not develop for more than a few days unless placed in the womb; the concept of potentiality is too broad to be useful - all the cells in the body now have the potential to be unique individuals through the process of cloning; and therapeutic cloning should be seen in the context of a society that allows abortion, the destruction of 'spare' IVF embryos, the taking of human life in circumstances such as war, and which regularly discusses the merits of capital punishment.Unlike a foetus, murderer or enemy soldier, a cloned blastocyst is not sentient. It would be unethical, even cruel, to put the rights of this embryo above those of a patient, argue the proponents of therapeutic cloning, adding that most people feel the same way: a recent MORI poll found that about 70 per cent of Britons support the use of human embryos for medical research to find treatments for serious diseases and for fertility research.While the European vote was celebrated by pro-life campaigners, there was bitterness and frustration among those striving to find treatments for serious diseases. Lord May, president of the Royal Society, said: 'We are very disappointed that the European Parliament has backed this cynical manipulation of the legislative process by a small minority.'The amendments were described as 'Luddite' by British MEPs. David Bowe MEP, Labour's research spokesman, said he was 'quite annoyed about it. It is wrong for the religious Right to assert its own moral view on the rest of us. There is no moral consensus in Europe on this and it really should be left up to individual member states.'Medical charities are equally outraged. 'The Parkinson's Disease Society will continue to work hard to ensure that this vital research can go ahead in the UK,' said Linda Kelly, chief executive. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation said the vote 'has great potential to damage research which could offer new treatments and cures for many millions of people'. And Robert Terry, senior policy adviser at the Wellcome Trust, said: 'It is particularly disappointing that the European Parliament seems intent on trying to force legislation of this kind, on an ethical issue that is better dealt with at a national level.'The controversial law still has a number of hoops to jump through, including a final reading in the European Parliament and the assent of EU ministers. Pragmatists hope EU health ministers will reject the amendments when they are presented with the Directive in June.Whatever the outcome, the row could not come at a worse time for European biotechnology. Six in every 10 private biotech companies have cancelled projects on genetically modified organisms in the past four years, due in part to the 'increasingly sceptical climate', EU Research Commissioner Philippe Busquin said this year.To add to the woes of scientists, a new study that emerged on the same day that the European vote fell suggested there might be more hurdles to therapeutic cloning than thought, and that reproductive cloning might even be impossible.Most researchers have dismissed as a publicity stunt a cult's claim to have cloned humans. However, a recent paper in the journal Science contains evidence that fundamental constraints in human embryonic development might make therapeutic cloning difficult, and reproductive cloning almost impossible.Other teams have tried to clone human embryos and found that they failed to develop properly, only managing a few cell divisions. Now an American team believes it might have found the reason why, after attemping to clone rhesus monkeys. Unpublished data from this and other groups suggests that the same problem could also thwart attempts to clone humans.Basic molecular obstacles were observed that blocked normal cell development in the primate embryos, despite using four different cloning techniques, said Prof Gerald Schatten, the paper's senior author and director of the Pittsburgh Development Centre at the Magee-Womens Research Institute. 'Human reproductive cloning is unsafe, unethical and ought to be illegal everywhere,' he added. 'This paper adds yet another reason not to attempt to clone a human offspring.'Prof Schatten's team tried the cloning methods on 724 eggs retrieved from female rhesus macaques. In the resulting embryos, packages of genes - chromosomes - did not split properly when cells divided, said Prof Schatten. 'From the very first cell division, development is inappropriate in vital ways.''When cells divide, there are very basic things that are supposed to happen, and they just didn't happen,' said Dr Calvin Simerly, the paper's first author.Among the key structures involved in cell division is the mitotic spindle, which precisely aligns and separates chromosomes. But as a result of cloning, they found 'chaotic' spindle structures and unequal chromosome counts. Even the most basic proteins involved in spindle formation were absent or inadequate.'Techniques such as those used to create Dolly the sheep, mice and other domestic animals do not work in non-human primates,' said Prof Schatten. 'I don't want to say this will never happen. Given enough time and materials, we may discover how to make it work. It just doesn't work now.'However, he believed the problem would not present a major obstacle to therapeutic cloning, where the aim is to obtain healthy cells of a given type for treatments, rather than grow an entire creature, which requires vast numbers of cells to perform properly, and in harmony. 'There are strategies to get around it for therapeutic cloning. I am still optimistic that there are ways to go forward.'The creator of Dolly, Prof Wilmut of the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, agrees that changes in the sequence of operations in nuclear transfer might offer a way forward. Even if pro-life opposition is overcome, it seems scientists will have to struggle with nature's own limits on cloning.n  n   Roger Highfield will talk about his new book, The Science of Harry Potter, and interview Lord May at the Cheltenham Festival of Science, June 4-8.

telegraph,14/09/2000 00:00,news,"   By Robert Uhlig, David Derbyshire and Roger Highfield     GENETICALLY modified cells derived from a human foetus will be used to treat British stroke victims in a clinical trial starting next year, it emerged last week. The brain cells, which contain a gene from a monkey virus, will be injected through the skulls of a dozen patients with the most common form of stroke. Tests of similar cells in animals have shown that they can repair damaged parts of the brain and restore mobility. The treatment is the latest use of stem cells, the flexible and easily cultured parent cells found throughout the human body. Every type of tissue stems from these cells. The cells used in the clinical trial originally came from the brain of an aborted foetus donated to medical research and were cultured by the biotech company ReNeuron.Once injected into a brain, the neural stem cells continue to divide, spreading through the brain and replacing damaged tissue. Because they are effectively immortal, the cells have been genetically engineered to carry an 'off' switch that stops them dividing once they reach body temperature. The switch is a gene from a monkey virus that has been added to the cell's chromosomes.Last week Dr John Sinden, the chief scientific officer of ReNeuron, stressed that the cells were perfectly safe. He told the association: 'When we injected them into the brains of animals they have recovered motor function. The ultimate goal is to produce a treatment for chronic disabilities after stroke.'The announcement coincides with the publication last week of new research into the flexibility of stem cells. A paper in last week's Science shows that differentiated brain cells can be converted into other types of brain tissue. Dr Toru Kondo and Dr Martin Raff of University College London show that one type of brain cell, called oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which help to protect neurons, can be converted back into neural stem cells using growth factors.Other factors are then used to change the stem cells into two other types of differentiated brain cell, neurons and astrocytes. The finding raises the possibility of removing a tiny sample of brain tissue from a patient, converting it into neural stem cells and then turning them into neurons to treat stroke, Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease."
telegraph,3/12/2003 0:01,education,"   Evolution deprived our eyes of the ability to regenerate. Roger Highfield looks at how Telegraph readers can help scientists overcome this hurdle   The quest to help the blind to see is no longer the province of miracles. Surgeons and scientists are increasingly confident that restoring lost vision is feasible, at least for some. And much of this growing confidence rests on their burgeoning knowledge of why nature makes such a mess of repairing eyes.The understanding could benefit more than those affected by eye injury and disease. Having difficulty with focusing affects many people above the age of 40, and scientists are coming closer to the day when an old lens, stiffened by age, could be replaced with a soft, artificial one to restore youthful vision.Surgeons are wary of eye operations for the same reason that blindness and impaired vision are so common: scar tissue is a common side effect of injury, disease and operations. And scar tissue can wreck the workings of the eye.Evolution has seen a trade-off between the need to regenerate and the need to repair damage. Making good a wound with rapidly-growing scar tissue, principally to stop infection, does not mean the same thing as making good a damaged eye. Better to put up with disorganised scar tissue to halt the risk of infection, even if it does put an eye out of operation, than leave an open wound so as to facilitate eye regeneration.'Somewhere in evolution, we have lost our ability to regenerate,' says Peng Tee Khaw, professor of ocular healing and glaucoma and head of the ocular repair and regeneration biology group at Moorfields Eye Hospital and the Institute of Ophthalmology. 'Our genes don't normally regenerate the eye, they just repair it.'For reasons not fully understood, not all living things have made this 'choice' in evolution. The salamander wallows in unhygienic conditions yet is able to replace its spinal cord, gills, parts of the brain, jaw and parts of the heart, along with its limbs and tail. And, to the envy of eye surgeons, its retina and iris, too.But the problem remains that humans lack the regenerative abilities of the salamander and possess eye-repair mechanisms that often cause blindness. Prof Khaw is one of a team at Moorfields and the institute trying to sidestep this by turning off natural repair mechanisms and enhancing natural regeneration.The new International Children's Eye Centre planned for the Moorfields site will build on this understanding for improving the treatment of young people with eye problems, a venture readers can support by backing the Daily Telegraph's Christmas charity appeal (see link).Repair mechanisms culminate in scarring, probably the major culprit when it comes to loss of sight. To find out what triggers scarring, when a disorganised mixture of proteins and cells patch up an injury, Prof Khaw and colleagues studied molecules that circulate in the eye.About a decade ago they found that one protein, called transforming growth factor (TGF) beta, seemed particularly important. It is no accident that previous work in Manchester revealed how this protein is almost absent from the foetus, which does not scar. This offered new hope of a way to prevent scarring by blocking TGF beta.Prof Khaw had shown that a quick and easy way to prevent scarring was to use a sponge to apply a drug that is also an anti-cancer agent. Although now the most commonly used method in the UK, it can have some side effects.To devise a more subtle way to achieve the same end, Prof Khaw's group teamed up with a company called Cambridge Antibody Technology, a specialist in devising molecules, called antibodies, that can bind to, and knock out, other molecules. In this case, the target was TGF beta.The team decided to test the antibody in the treatment of glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness, where the reduction of the normal flow of fluid through the drainage channels in the eye causes the build-up of pressure and damage to the eye. There is an operation, called a trabeculectomy, to make a little trapdoor valve in the eye. However, subsequent scarring can cause problems, particularly for children: they heal more quickly but suffer more scarring as a result. 'This remains a serious problem,' says Prof Khaw. 'When the operations fail, the children can then go blind from glaucoma.''Now surgeons are injecting the antibody Trabio (lerdelimumab) into the skin around the eye to prevent scarring during trabeculectomies. A pilot trial showed that the tissue looked much more natural and that there was little scarring after the operation. 'That was very exciting for us. That was the first time a protein antibody against TGF beta was used in patients,' he says.Doctors are now half way through several larger international studies. One hope is that the antibodies will mop up TGF beta without significant side effects. 'So far, the results have been promising,' says Prof Khaw, who hopes the antibody can be used to make glaucoma operations last for life.The antibodies could find other uses. One common cause of blindness, particularly among the elderly, is macular degeneration. In one form of the disease, blood vessels leak under the retina. As a consequence, there is also secondary scarring. Although many new therapies for macular degeneration are under development to halt blood vessel growth, 'anti-scarring therapy could help,' says Prof Khaw.TGF beta is also important in the tissue repair that leads to damage to the optic nerve at the back of the eye caused by glaucoma. 'If we can stop the optic nerve being compressed in glaucoma we can prevent people ever becoming blind,' says Dr Francesca Cordeiro, head of the glaucoma and optic nerve research group. She is developing new methods of halting the scarring processes in the retina in glaucoma with novel gene therapy and drugs to stop nerve cells from dying.Teams at Moorfields and the Institute of Ophthalmology are also studying repair mechanisms at work in the lens of the eye. This, they hope, will improve the success of a very common operation to replace a lens that has become clouded by dead cells (cataracts).Unfortunately, up to 30 per cent of patients who undergo cataract surgery suffer a secondary loss of vision over time that necessitates corrective surgery. The problem lies with a 'bag' in the eye that contains the old cloudy lens which has to be replaced.During the cataract operations, the old lens is sucked out of the bag and replaced by a plastic lens. But this can trigger repair mechanisms in the bag, causing it to contract and turn stiff and opaque, 'like a plastic bag in the sun', says Prof Khaw. As well as ruining the operation, the same repair mechanism prevents much more flexible artificial lenses from being implanted because they would be constrained by 'a bag of scar tissue'.One approach would be to use the antibody or other anti-scarring treatments to turn off this repair mechanism. As well as preventing a common side effect of millions of operations, it would also realise a long-held dream of ophthalmologists: they would be able to insert into this flexible capsule an accommodating lens, perhaps by injecting materials such as hydrogels, which are elastic just like the natural lens. 'The reason you can read a newspaper is that your lens is accommodating, getting fatter and smaller: it is not stiff. If the capsule can be prevented from going stiff, then flexible lenses under development around the world could allow you to read without reading glasses,' says Stephen Tuft, a cataract and cornea specialist at Moorfields.Other research is concentrating on how to regenerate tissue. One approach is to make vital cells multiply again. The Moorfields consultant Frank Larkin is studying innovative ways, including gene therapy, to make the non-repairing endothelial cells which line the inside of the clear corneal window divide again and repair the eye. These cells pump water out of the eye; when they fail the cornea goes cloudy. Restoring these cells could clear the cornea, meaning a corneal transplant with the risks of rejection would not be required.Another approach is to use 'parent' cells, or stem cells, from which all other types grow. These parent cells are exploited by the salamander: when they sever a limb, stem cells form a mound called a 'blastema' and re-differentiate to form the tissue to rebuild the limb.Injuries to the cornea and certain diseases cause failure of the stem cells found on the outside of the cornea, and this failure is responsible for the blindness that strikes with a disease called aniridia. As a consequence, abnormal tissue invades the cornea and makes it opaque. 'If we could replenish these stem cells, we could not only help this condition but also treat other diseases or eye damage,' says Dr Julie Daniels, head of the epithelial stem-cell transplant laboratory.For this kind of use, and for cells to repair the back of the eye (retina) too, a 'state of the art' stem-cell transplant unit is being built at the institute and Moorfields. Transplant of stem cells or regenerated cells from a donated eye - or even from a patient's healthy eye - could help restore sight in children and adults.'Scarring or poor regeneration of tissue plays a role in every major blinding disease in the world today, in both children and adults,' says Prof Khaw. 'If we could fully understand and control these processes, most of the children with glaucoma that I see could be cured for life, and better still, we could begin to prevent or treat most of the blinding diseases that are currently untreatable.''"
telegraph,8/7/2000 0:00,finance,"   The boom in biotech means profits are there, but volatility can be bad for your health, warns Alexandra Jackson-Proes     BIOTECHNOLOGY funds came under the microscope this week, after the draft publication of the human genetic sequence or 'genome' bolstered interest in the sector.                               Gene genie: Gregor Mendel, the founder of modern genetics          Biotech stocks had a bumpy start to the year, with the sector reaching a peak in March before falling back just a few weeks later. However, experts claim things are beginning to look up again for biotech funds.Lesley Hankin, marketing manager at Framlington, said: 'In our opinion biotechs have a great future, but through solid growth, rather than the explosive returns which have been seen over the last six months.'Close Finsbury Asset Management also said there is a strong case for investing in the biotech industry. Demographic trends already predict a demand for better healthcare and improved drugs in future to help cure and even prevent diseases in an ageing population.Companies such as Oxford GlycoSciences, Cambridge Antibody, Aortech and Celera Genomics are likely to play an increasingly important role. Edward Wawrzynczak of Rothschild Bioscience Unit said that investors should take a long hard look at the sector: 'Biotechnology is an evolving sector and will be in continued demand.'An ageing population will increase the burden of disease as well as change the nature of diseases. This will place escalating pressures on the industry to come up with novel solutions.'Biotechnology companies are responsible for researching new drugs before they are passed to the pharmaceuticals industry for development. Only a handful of companies manage to get products beyond the initial research stages. If a product does succeed it can take up to a decade to reach the shops.However, the success of just one product can set a stock's price alight and return handsome rewards to private investors.Yet investors must remember that biotechs carry a serious health warning and should be treated with the same caution as technology stocks. They should be aware that the prospect of glowing returns are tied in with the inherent risks of what can be a high-risk game.Selecting potential winners from individual stocks is complex, and private investors would be better-off leaving the stock picking to the experts and choosing a pooled fund which invests in biotech stocks. Finsbury and Rothschild Asset Management both offer investment trusts, while Framlington, City Financial and, most recently, Schroders offer unit trusts which aim to take advantage of new medical discoveries.According to statistician Standard & Poor's Micropal, the performance of Rothschild's International Biotechnology Trust fund last year was phenomenal. Unfortunately its founder Jeremy Curnock Cook left the company last week due to ill health.If you had invested a £1,000 over one year in Rothschild's International Biotechnology Fund it would now be worth £4,901. However, over the medium term - three and five years - the diminishing returns on the fund illustrate the volatility of the sector. Over three years £1,000 would currently be worth £2,279, while over five years it would be worth a little over £3,000.Biotech unit trusts also produced some impressive returns over a one-year period. For example, £1,000 invested in City Financial Bio-Technology - the only pure biotech unit trust - a year ago would now be worth £2,910. The same pot invested over five years would have returned a healthy £5,095.Framlington Health returned less to its investors. An initial investment of £1,000 five years ago would currently be worth £4,546, compared to the £4,820 average for the sector.Ian Beestin, a director of The Isa Shop, said that biotech investments should not be the core holding of any portfolio and should make up no more than five per cent of a portfolio. He liked both Framlington's Health Fund, which invests in primarily in smaller companies, and The Schroder Medical Discovery Fund, which invests in large established healthcare companies such as Glaxo Wellcome. He suggests a regular investment in both funds as complementary investments, since each takes a different slant on the same market.Mike Attree, an adviser at Torquil Clark, also suggested that investors stick to either Framlington or Schroders. He said: 'City Financial is a much smaller player, purely investing in biotech stocks. In such a specialist and volatile sector it might be better to chose a fund which not only invests in biotech but spreads the risk across the health sector.'Mr Attree also recommended looking at the investment trusts available which currently stand at a discount. He liked Finsbury Worldwide Pharmaceuticals and said that although it was trading at a smaller discount than previously, it was not too late to invest."
telegraph,24/08/2000 00:00,news,"   The Government announced last week that scientists should be permitted to clone human embryos for experiments aimed at finding revolutionary treatment for problem diseases. Roger Highfield reports.  PEERS and MPs will be given a free vote later this year on whether to relax the law in line with the recommendations of an expert group headed by Prof Liam Donaldson, the Government's Chief Medical Officer. Ministers hope that the measures will lead to the development of treatments using stem cells, embryonic cells that have the ability to develop into any desired type, from nerve to liver and muscle. Prof Donaldson said: 'Stem cell research opens up a new medical frontier.'It offers enormous potential for new treatments for chronic disease, injuries, and the relief of human suffering.' He listed stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, common cancers, and injuries such as those to the spinal cord. But the momentous proposal to allow limited human cloning was greeted with dismay by pro-life and religious groups. They said there were alternatives to embryonic stem cells and condemned the proposals as shocking, immoral and unnatural. Scientists were now on a 'slippery slope' to cloning people.In response to widespread disquiet, the Government promised legislation to outlaw reproductive cloning, the creation of duplicate human beings. Although this is effectively banned under existing rules, it is not specifically outlawed. The proposals were welcomed by organisations representing doctors, patients and scientists, who hailed them as a far sighted move towards 'a new kind of medicine'. A spokesman for one medical charity, the Special Parkinson's Research Interest Group, said the fears of the pro-life lobby had to be weighed against the interests of patients 'whose daily lives are dominated by the struggle to cope with crippling conditions'.The proposals call for an extension of research on embryos from IVF (fertilisation of an egg with sperm in the laboratory), and for work on embryos created by 'therapeutic cloning', both up to the 14-day limit, or the appearance of the 'primitive streak', when the nervous system appears. Lord Winston, the test-tube baby pioneer and a leading member of the pro-lobby, said last week that 'we are going to have a fight'. He was responding to comments by the Tory health spokesman, Dr Liam Fox, who attacked the proposals as 'the extension of an already unacceptable position' and will vote against them.Dr Fox was, in turn, called the spokesman of 'an extreme anti-abortion fundamentalist Right-wing party' by Dr Evan Harris, the Liberal Democrat science spokesman. Dr Harris criticised the Government for dragging its feet so that patients with degenerative disease have to wait even longer for new treatments. These are the opening shots of a row that is likely to return to the issue of whether any research should be performed on human embryos, which was hotly debated before the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.After balancing ethical considerations against benefits, Prof Donaldson's committee concluded that the range of research should be broadened to stem-cell studies to treat disease and disorders. The group concluded that 'the proposed new research did not raise fundamentally new ethical issues, different from those raised by currently permitted forms of embryo research'. Critics say the use of embryonic cells is unnecessary: recent studies in America, Sweden and elsewhere have shown that stem cells can be isolated from umbilical cord blood, adult tissue, such as bone marrow, and from an aborted foetus.Prof Donaldson said researchers have to study many issues before stem cells can be used to treat illness. Scientists must confirm that cells made by cloning would develop normally, check whether they age more rapidly and screen for unpredictable mutations and tumours. He said 'we are very well served' by existing safeguards in the 1990 Act, which provide a framework for the new proposals. 'We have the most tightly regulated system in the world.' He added that the recommendations focus on research, not treatment, and legislation would have to be re-examined when treatments based on stem cells emerge."
telegraph,6/10/2004 0:01,news," An unlimited supply of human nerve stem cells that can be used for brain and eye repair is being grown for the first time in the laboratory by a British company.          The firm, ReNeuron, will apply next year to treat stroke patients with brain stem cells grown from cells isolated years ago from the brain of a foetus that had been aborted for medical reasons.          The company has found a way to mass-produce the foetal stem cells. By cloning and growing them in the laboratory and by inserting a special gene, to 'immortalise' them, it has been able reliably to turn these brain stem cells into specific cell types in the laboratory.          ReNeuron, has generated a bank of millions of nerve stem cells, the first of its kind in the world. It believes that, in the body, these cells will be turned by naturally-present growth factors into cortex cells to treat stroke; and in other situations, striatal cells for the degenerative disorder Huntington's disease; and retinal cells for the treatment of blindness.          John Sinden, the chief scientific officer of the Guildford-based company, yesterday presented encouraging studies of the use of the human stem cells to repair the effects of stroke in rats. 'It is a functional effect rather than an anatomical effect,' he said.          The treated rodents had a 'significant' restoration of movement and an enhanced sense of feeling, in detecting sticky tape on their paws, compared with two types of control, Dr Sinden told the American Neurological Association Annual Meeting in Toronto, Canada.          Later this month, the company will also publish encouraging results on the use of its human nerve stem cells to treat animal models of the devastating and incurable brain disorder, Huntington's Disease.          Previously, scientists have tried to treat diseases such as Parkinson's with implants of foetal brain tissue. But this required several foetuses for each patient, which raised practical and ethical concerns."
telegraph,19/08/2003 00:01,news," King's College London has won the race to become the first British team to grow human embryo stem cells in the laboratory - 'master' cells that can be turned into any type, from bone to nerve.'This is an exciting day for UK science. Stem cells offer new hope for treatments, and even cures, for many common diseases,' said Prof Sir George Radda, the chief executive of the Medical Research Council, which is banking the cells.Human embryonic stem cells have rarely been out of the headlines since they were isolated in 1998 by a team in Wisconsin. The work offers great potential for treating many conditions, from heart disease to diabetes, but has been condemned by pro-life groups who see research on embryos as morally wrong.These cells are extremely rare and have proved extraordinarily difficult to grow in the laboratory. Researchers have to guard against infection, contamination or colonies changing into nerve or other tissue.Several teams were in the running to isolate Britain's first fully characterised line of stem cells from human embryos. But today the King's team, led by Dr Stephen Minger and Dr Susan Pickering, reports success in the internet journal Reproductive Biomedicine Online.Human embryonic stem cells are found in the earliest stages of development and are capable of giving rise to all the 200 or so different types of cell in the body.'We are very excited,' said Dr Minger. 'Their possible therapeutic uses are almost endless and could help in the fight against diseases ranging from diabetes to Parkinson's.'The cells came from an effort to screen IVF embryos for genetic disease, a process called preimplantation genetic diagnosis, conducted at Guy's and St Thomas' Assisted Conception Unit.Five day old embryos, rejected because they had - or were thought to have - disease-causing genes, were provided to the King's team, after approval by parents who were briefed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.Simon Festing, of the Association of Medical Research Charities, said: 'This is great news for families of people suffering from debilitating diseases. This is a clear endorsement of the Government's policy to make the UK a world leader in stem cell research.'But the research was condemned by Professor Jack Scarisbrick, chairman of the anti-abortion group Life. 'You can say these embryos are going to die anyway but it's like robbing the dead soldier. It's a further affront to their dignity to be cannibalising them in this way.'The scientists are delighted because there's big money at stake. It could mean huge business, and of course it's power. It's forbidden fruit, playing with human life.'"
telegraph,15/02/2004 00:01,news," The end of dentures is nigh. Dental scientists are perfecting techniques that will allow new teeth to be grown in the mouths of adult patients within a few years.          Hair, skin and other tissues would be turned into 'tooth primordia' in the laboratory, then implanted into the mouth where they would grow into teeth, the American Association for the Advancement of Science was told yesterday.          Paul Sharpe, of the Dental Institute, King's College, London, told the Seattle conference that his team had successfully implanted a tooth from a mouse embryo into the mouth of an adult mouse and had watched it grow.          'This has never been done for any organ,' he said.          The breakthrough was part of important advances in 'regenerative dentistry'. The studies of mice showed that 'tooth rudiments' could be grown from stem cells, in the body which have the ability to develop into other cell types.          Prof Sharpe said teeth grew from two basic cell types, and the team had already managed to replace one of them by using stem cells from an adult. When the second type was added from an embryo, and nourished with a blood supply, what resulted was a tooth surrounded by bone. 'This is the first test that this technique will work,' he said.          The team is now trying to replace the second tooth cell type, which forms tooth enamel, using stem cells.          In parallel, the team has investigated how to use stem cells to grow teeth in the mouth.          Prof Sharpe said the tooth the team had implanted from the mouse embryo contained both cell types.          'We are proud to be part of this radical step forwards in dental research,' he said. 'The results we are unveiling today provide evidence that understanding and controlling the processes that form teeth is leading to a whole new approach to dentistry.'          A commercial company, Odontis, has been set up to develop this new approach, which has been studied by Prof Sharpe for the past two years. The next step will take the team to the point where they can form a tooth rudiment consisting of both types of basic cells from stem cells. The method could be ready to test on patients by 2007, he said.          Odontis claims on its website that it 'will offer the first natural, live tooth replacement'.          A spokesman for the British Dental Association said: 'This sounds like the next step from what some people have done already, which is to grow teeth in the lab. It's reasonable to expect that, in the next decade or so, we will see these sorts of advances with all the research going on in this areas - including all the dental research institutes in this country.'          Stem cells can be collected from a variety of sources including bone marrow and umbilical cord tissue.          Last year it emerged that the tissue in baby teeth is also a good source of the special cells.          In addition to preventing one of the most inevitable and visible signs of old age, scientists hope to use stem cells to grow tissue or even whole new organs to provide radical new treatments for heart disease, stroke, spinal injuries and diabetes."
telegraph,5/12/2002 0:01,news," The question about whether one is a man or mouse is made redundant today by an £80 million international scientific programme that concludes that men are mice without tails.Today's publication of the draft genetic sequence - genome - of the mouse, Mus musculus, reveals that a mouse and William Shakespeare are described by almost the same set of genes, the difference is in the way they are regulated.The analysis by the publicly-funded Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium provides clear evidence of natural selection driving evolution, revealing that although humans are essentially mice without tails, we still possess the genes that could make a tail.Mice have the same basic biological processes but are most genetically different from humans when it comes to immunity, reproduction, and smell.The mouse genome is shorter than that of humans (2.5 billion 'letters' of genetic code, compared with our 2.9 billion) but it provides a vital clue to unlock the secrets of being human: we both have about 30,000 genes and share 80 per cent of them, with up to 99 per cent being related in some way, said Dr Ewan Birney of the European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, though he added that 'just one gene can change anatomy dramatically.'Despite the claims of antivivisectionists, the analysis in the journal Nature shows that mice are still similar enough to us to be the best laboratory models for human health research, providing a crucial testing ground for drugs and treatments, said Prof Allan Bradley, director of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge.Around 90 per cent of genes associated with disease are identical in human and mouse. 'A lot of medical discoveries will come through the analysis of mutations in mice.'Each day, a horde of mice perhaps 25 million strong helps researchers worldwide to study and devise treatments for human ailments including cancer, heart disease, HIV and malaria.Elucidation and analysis of the mouse genome - which can be tinkered with very precisely - will greatly boost these efforts. In effect, the genome provides 'a phrasebook to understand the human,' said Dr Jane Rogers of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.One of the many scientists who will exploit today's work is Wellcome Trust researcher Dr Fiona Powrie at Oxford University, who has developed a model of inflammatory bowel disease in mice that mimicks human disorders such as Crohn's disease and is used to develop new treatments. 'The publication of the mouse genome will impact significantly on our work,' she said.Dr Paul Crocker and his team from Dundee University have made use of information from the human and mouse projects to identify a new group of genes, coding for proteins called siglecs, that are implicated in inflammation and form the first line of defence against infections.Although four-fifths of genes are now known to be held in common between humans and mice, Prof Chris Ponting from the Medical Research Council's Functional Genetics Unit in Oxford found that gene differences hold the key to understanding recent evolution.The consortium's ultimate goal is to produce a 'finished' mouse sequence, with 99.99 per cent accuracy, which will take two or three years. The human sequence is expected to be finished by April next year.Next in line for sequencing are the chimpanzee, the chicken, the cow, the dog, several species of fungi, a sea urchin, the honey bee and two simple organisms commonly used in laboratory studies (Oxytricha trifallax and Tetrahymena thermophila).Each organism will shed unique insights into human health and disease.

telegraph,18/05/2007 00:01,news,"                                             Explained: Stem cells, hybrids, cybrids and chimeras                                             Research into potentially life-saving medical treatments using part-human, part-animal embryos is to be allowed after a rethink by ministers.                                       Two teams of British researchers are seeking permission to create 'cybrid' embryos that would be around 99.9 per cent human and 0.1 per cent animal to produce embryonic stem cells - the body’s building blocks that grow into all other types of cells.         They want to use the stem cells to understand and provide new treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, cystic fibrosis, motor neurone disease and Huntington’s.         Scientists, MPs and patient groups reacted angrily to the release in December of a White Paper that proposed a ban on creating part-human, part animal hybrids with a provision to allow it under certain circumstances under licence.         Today the Government published its draft Human Tissue and Embryos Bill – a major overhaul of the laws covering embryo research and fertility treatment.         While similar work has been carried out in China and the US where science is less regulated, the new laws will be among the first in the world to set out in legislation what forms of research are permissible in this field.         The Bill will allow cytoplasmic embryos, or cybrids, made using eggs from rabbits or cows that have had their nucleus replaced with genetic code from human cells.Human-animal chimeras - human embryos that have been altered through the introduction of animal cells – will also be permitted.         So-called 'true' human-animal hybrids, created by fertilising a human egg with animal sperm or vice versa, will remain banned. In all cases these would only be allowed for research and it would be illegal to allow such embryos to grow for more than 14 days or be implanted into a womb.          Caroline Flint, health minister,  denied the draft bill represented a U-turn, saying that while the White Paper started from a 'general prohibition' it had always left the door open for specific research on a case-by-case basis.          'We have had some useful discussion. I’m very pleased that sections of the scientific community have stepped up to be clearer about how they intend to use opportunities for research in these areas.         'We are minded to accept the principle that legislation should allow for the creation of inter-species embryos for research purposes, subject to the exceptions laid out in the Bill.         'I don’t see this as a back flip... it was an evaluation of a number of different view points. I suppose it’s a difference between saying 'no but’ instead of 'yes, but’.'         Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, head of the division of developmental genetics at the National Institute for Medical Research, said: 'I am very pleased that the draft Bill proposes that research involving mixtures of animal and human material, whether cytoplasmic hybrids or chimeras, ought not to be subject to a ban.          'It is reassuring that the advice of the scientific community and of the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee seems to have been taken on board during the drafting of the legislation, which some of us had feared was being swayed more by those opposed to scientific progress than by common sense and real understanding of the issues.'         But Dr Peter Saunders, of the Christian Medical Fellowship, said: 'By caving into pressure from the biotechnology industry the Government has failed to recognise the limitations of science and has patronisingly dismissed major moral and ethical concerns         'Creating such hybrids is unnecessary and unethical. It would diminish human dignity, blur moral boundaries, and cross the fundamental line that has always separated humans from animals. The possible ends do not justify the means.'         Other key measures set out in the draft Bill are the same as in the White Paper, including a ban on sex selection for non-medical reasons and the removal of 'the need for a father' from guidelines for taking account of a child’s welfare when providing IVF and other fertility treatment.         The Bill will now go before a House of Commons scrutiny committee and is due to be included in the Queen’s speech in November. "
telegraph,10/5/2007 14:15,news,"            A small furry creature is the latest to have its genome cracked, reports Roger Highfield                   The genetic code of the grey, short-tailed opossum is unveiled today, a milestone in genetics that will aid research on the most aggressive form of skin cancer and help reveal what it means to be human too.           The tiny nocturnal South American mammal is used by researchers worldwide for research on human health and disease and has now become the first marsupial to have its DNA code read, or sequenced, as scientists put it.         A comparison of its genetic code with our own will give insights into how human DNA is organised, how it has evolved and how it works.                      Monodelphis domestica, a relative of kangaroos and koalas, is also the only mammal known to develop melanoma skin cancer solely from exposure to ultraviolet light, the cause in most human cases, so the animal is invaluable for understanding the rise in skin cancer seen in Britain and elsewhere.           The Broad Institute Sequencing Centre and Harvard University near Boston, Massachusetts, led the project which includes the Medical Research Council's Functional Genetics Unit, University of Oxford, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, near Cambridge.           The advance, announced in the journal Nature, will have a significant impact on biomedical research, said coauthor John VandeBerg of the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio, who first developed the animal as a scientific model, starting in 1979.                      Monodelphis  is particularly useful in studies of foetal development and genetic factors related to high cholesterol, he said. Because the baby marsupial can regenerate a severed or crushed spinal cord, up to about one week of age, this species offers insight into therapies for spinal cord injury.           Dr VandeBerg and his collaborators at the Universities of Melbourne and Miami studying the genes that make this healing possible, and what changes occur that cause the animal to lose this ability as it matures. Identifying and understanding those changes could lead to new ideas for treatment of human spinal cord injuries.           'Trying to find these genes has been extremely difficult without having the sequence of the animal,' said VandeBerg. 'But now that the sequence is available, I expect it to eliminate as much as one to three years of preliminary work required before a researcher can zero in on a gene or set of genes that appears to play a role.'           Prof Kerstin Lindblad-Toh of the Broad Institute pointed out: 'Marsupials are the closest living relatives of placental mammals, which include humans. Because of this relationship, the opossum genome offers a unique lens through which to view the evolution of our own genome.'           The human genome is littered with relics of 'jumping genes' - scraps of DNA that hopped about chromosomes for more than a billion years. Although these jumping genes have been widely regarded as parasites, the new work suggests they played a creative role in evolution - spreading key genetic innovations.           In the light of today's work, evolutionary change seems more to do with how genes are regulated than the emergence of new, mutated, genes. The opossum packs almost the same number of genes into nine pairs of huge chromosomes - bundles of DNA - that humans spread out over 23 smaller pairs, making the two species ideal for comparison and shedding light on their common ancestor, which lived 180 million years ago.         Thanks to the new work it seems that genes located deep within chromosomes gather changes that could lead to disease more quickly than those found close to the chromosomal edge, according to a study led by Dr Leo Goodstadt and Prof Chris Ponting of the Functional Genetics Unit, published in the journal Genome Research.           Prof Ponting said: 'This discovery is important because it will help us to separate DNA changes in the human genome that lead to disease from those that don't.'           The marsupial has around 20,000 genes, most of which have counterparts in people. Opossum-specific genes mostly originate from the expansion and rapid turnover of gene families involved in immunity, sensory perception and detoxification.           Seven in every ten opossum and human genes were present as single genes in the species' common ancestor 180 million years ago, and genes involved in immune defence have evolved faster than any others. Dr Goodstadt explains: 'All mammals could be described as being in an arms race. They are always fighting off parasites and disease in a competition to see which can breed and survive to produce the next generation. The opossum genome has shown us that it is genes involved in immunity that change most rapidly.'           This is important in giving us extra options in tackling diseases that affect people, he added. 'Observing how genes in other species have successfully dealt with parasites and bacteria could suggest new ways to approach development of therapies to battle human infections.'                      Monodelphis domestica is found in Brazil, Bolivia, Guyana and elsewhere in South America. An adult weighs three to four ounces and is about twice the size of a mouse, and usually lives no longer than two years in the wild."
telegraph,8/4/2008 0:01,news,"            Against: 'benefits based on fantasy, not fact'                              Josephine Quintavalle, from Comment On Reproductive Ethics:                  Many scientists involved in the hybrid proposals and who make great claims for its potential in treatments lack credibility. They often have little real experience of Alzheimer's, Parkinsons and the litany of degenerative diseases about which we will allegedly learn from this research.         No mention is ever made by them of the existing, disease-specific, fully human stem-cell lines which must be superior to hypothetical inter-species ones.         They fail to acknowledge the innumerable problems that have already arisen from cloning, even when the cells are from the same species, which is not well understood.         And they rarely acknowledge how the market has already voted for alternatives. At a recent Stem Cell summit in New York it was more than obvious that most private investment is going into adult stem cell technology.         Even when it comes to using human eggs and cells for cloning, there has been surprisingly little progress. Human cloned embryonic stem cells have never been produced and the benefits for human medicine still seem based more on fantasy than fact.         There are safety fears, too, about straight embryonic stem cell therapy that are rarely aired.         The ethical bottom line is that the law allows experiments on human embryos when it can be proved that it is necessary or desirable. I do not think the creation of animal-human hybrids meets this criteria.                     For: 'we have a moral duty to cure illness'                              Robin Lovell-Badge, from the National Institute for Medical Research:                  The idea that scientists want to create monsters by mixing animal and human DNA or cells is nonsense. We have been doing the latter for decades without producing any monsters. Moreover, the proposals in the Bill will make it illegal if we encourage such 'admixed embryos' to develop beyond 14 days, or try to implant them into a woman or animal.         Scientists feel it their moral duty to find ways of treating illness. We feel very frustrated with proclamations based on falsehoods that are designed to scare the layman into thinking we want to use late-stage embryos for spare parts or just to degrade human dignity.          Humanity is best served by the discovery of cures, not by blocking avenues of research that may lead to them.         Another statement that really annoys me is that adult stem cells have led to 70 or so cures, whereas embryonic stem cells have given none. The first number is too high; I suspect many cures are subtle variations on a theme, and probably include some dubious claims. By comparison, we have only been working on cures using human embryonic stem cells since 1998.         I cringe at the claim that babies born after mitochondrial transplantation - implanting the DNA from an embryo into another human egg to cure a particularly nasty set of diseases - would have three parents.          The contribution to the child will be far less than, say, a bone marrow transplant - and we don't consider the bone marrow donor to be a parent!"

The first genetic code of a food crop to be read in detail, the DNA of rice has 400 million genetic letters holding 37,544 genes in all - about 12,000 more genes than humans - and is unveiled today in a scientific journal.          Previous studies have reported a draft sequence, but an international consortium has now taken the genetic sequence to the point where it will be much more useful to scientists and plant breeders looking to improve existing rice varieties and develop new ones, both by traditional methods and by genetic modification.          Rice (Oryza sativa) has been central to human nutrition and culture for 10,000 years and the study will aid efforts to feed the world's rapidly increasing population, according to members of the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project, which included the John Innes Centre in Norwich.          Rice is the staple food for more than half of the world's population - with three billion people dependent on it worldwide. However, growing it uses large volumes of water and, compared with similar crops, it is inefficient. It is also vulnerable to drought.          Consumption trends suggest that 4.6 billion people will be reliant on rice crops by the year 2025, necessitating a 30 per cent increase in world production.          Prof Rod Wing, of the University of Arizona and a member of the consortium, said: 'Demand is expected to double in 50 years, so we need to learn all we can about rice.'          The crop is closely related to other major cereal grasses - including corn, wheat, barley, rye, sorghum and millet - that collectively supply two third's of humanity's food.          'This has transformed the way we study the UK's main crops - wheat and barley,' said Prof Michael Bevan of the John Innes Centre.          Using the rice genome, his colleague Graham Moore has found a DNA feature in wheat called the 'pairing locus', which led to the variety that underpinned bread-making in western and middle eastern civilisations. 'All bread wheats are maintained by this pairing locus,' said Prof Bevan.          Plant scientists can now exactly pin down genes linked to desirable properties such as crop yield, drought tolerance and pest resistance. An important goal is to place newly identified, advantageous genes into regional rice varieties that are adapted to particular regions and growth conditions.          Scientists have already used the finished sequence to identify genes that control fundamental processes, such as flowering. Rice's similarity to barley has also helped researchers identify genes responsible for resistance to barley powdery mildew and stem rust, two major diseases.          'Rice is a critically important crop, and this finished sequence represents a major milestone,' said Robin Buell, lead investigator for the Institute of Genomic Research's (TIGR) portion of the project.          'We know the scientific community can use these data to develop new varieties of rice that deliver increased yields and grow in harsher conditions.'          The finished DNA sequence, which is published in the journal Nature, will speed up the hunt for genes that increase yield, protect against disease and pests, or provide drought-resistance in rice and other cereal crops, she said.          Rice is genetically similar to maize, wheat, barley, rye, sorghum, and sugar cane. 'Rice is the Rosetta Stone for crop genomes,' added Ms Buell.          TIGR researchers, based in Rockville, Maryland, sequenced more than 10 per cent of the genome of the temperate subspecies of rice, Oryza sativa subspecies japonica, which is cultivated mainly in Japan, Korea, and the United States.          The International Rice Genome Sequencing Project began in 1998 and pooled the resources of groups from 10 nations - Japan, China, India, Thailand, Taiwan, Brazil, France, Canada, the Britain and the United States.

Two years ago, the 29-year-old police officer from London lost 80 per cent of her own blood supply when an emergency Caesarean operation went wrong.          It took six blood transfusions to stop her bleeding to death, and a further 12 pints in the following days as she recovered.             'If it hadn't been for the blood donated by other people, my daughter would not have had a mother,' she said. 'I had lost so much blood, my organs were starting to shut down. The transfusion I was given saved my life.'             Since it was first introduced into hospitals during the Second World War, blood transfusion has been popular among surgeons as a way of helping patients recover more quickly by replacing the blood they might lose during an operation.             Although initially developed for emergency situations - such as Julie's - where patients suffer massive blood loss from traumatic injuries, events and accidents, surgeons soon began using donated blood in routine surgery.          Each day, around 8,000 pints of donated blood are used in Britain and transfusions figure in 60 per cent of all operations in some parts of the country. Nearly half of all heart surgery patients are given blood, for example, yet only three per cent of these transfusions are given because of life-threatening bleeding.         But it seems that in many non-life-threatening cases, this blood could be doing unnecessary harm to patients, and some surgeons are increasingly reluctant to give transfusions except in emergencies.          It appears that blood transfusions are linked to higher death rates and post-operative illness in patients than those who do not receive donated blood.          The cause of these problems is not the much-publicised risk of blood-borne infections that may be missed in screening, or even the use of the wrong blood type.          In fact, the latest evidence suggests that chemical changes in donated blood harm the recipient's body, increasing the risk of heart attacks, strokes and organ damage. Many surgeons are now opting to carry out routine surgery without blood transfusions.         'There has never been a clinical trial on whether blood transfusions during surgery are actually beneficial,' said Dr Gavin Murphy, a consultant cardiac surgeon at Bristol Royal Infirmary and a researcher at Bristol University. He says there is an urgent need for clinical trials on the effectiveness of blood transfusions.         'We need to look at whether withholding blood transfusion or giving low levels of blood transfusion is any better or worse for patients than giving high levels of blood transfusion. Most studies show an association between blood transfusion and adverse outcomes in patients, but we still don't understand the cause.'         In a study of 8,500 cardiac patients over eight years, Dr Murphy and his colleagues found a three-fold increase in the risk of dying in the year following surgery among patients who had received a transfusion. Patients also suffered an increased risk of complications after their operation, mainly associated with a lack of oxygen to key organs.          The results, which are supported by other international studies, are at odds with the widely held belief that transfusions of red blood cells can help aid patients' recovery by carrying oxygen to their tissues.         Since these concerns were first raised, Dr Murphy and his colleagues have halved the number of their own cardiac surgery patients who receive blood transfusions, without any adverse reactions. They now hope to identify exactly why blood transfusions may be having this harmful effect.         Their latest research, which is still to be published, provides some clues. They found that patients who have received blood transfusions during cardiac surgery also suffered increased levels of inflammation throughout their bodies.          Dr Murphy believes that problems develop when donated blood is stored for transfusion and there is build-up of toxic biological chemicals released as red blood cells age and disintegrate.          Under normal circumstances in the body, the by-products of red blood cell death are processed or excreted. But in stored blood, they accumulate and may trigger an inflammatory reaction in the patient's body when they are transfused.         Dr Murphy said: 'When red blood cells break down, they release phospholipids. These are really nasty molecules that are almost identical to the inflammatory molecules that are released by the body during infection and trauma.'         Haemoglobin, the large, iron-containing molecule that binds oxygen in red blood cells, also accumulates in the stored blood. Usually this is packaged safely inside the blood cells but, once free in the blood stream, it can be toxic to the kidney and affect circulation in small blood vessels.         These findings, combined with the risks posed by blood-borne infections and the shortage of blood donors in this country, have given scientists a new impetus in the quest to find an artificial alternative to donated blood.          For decades, they have worked on blood substitutes but have been unsuccessful due to the toxicity of many of the resulting products.          Only one country - South Africa, where high levels of HIV make blood transfusions high-risk - has so far licensed an artificial blood product for use in emergency situations.          But now a new generation of artificial blood products is on the horizon that scientists hope will overcome the toxic effect.         Most previous blood substitutes have attempted to harness the ability of haemoglobin to carry oxygen around the body, but, as described above, without the protective shell of a red blood cell, the haemoglobin molecules can roam freely through the body and damage tissue.          Researchers at Essex University, however, have discovered one of the underlying reasons why free haemoglobin is so harmful - without the protection of a red blood cell it effectively 'rusts' and produces harmful free radicals. They believe that by subtly changing the structure of the haemoglobin, they may be able to prevent this process.         Professor Chris Cooper, who is leading the research, said: 'The challenge is to make artificial molecules as good as red blood cells at carrying and releasing oxygen while avoiding the harmful effects.          'We think that by modifying the part of the haemoglobin that facilitates this rusting process, it will be possible to reduce the free radical production. Having effective artificial blood substitutes could help overcome the difficulties we face with maintaining the supply of blood donations, ensuring blood is clean and also avoid the harm that is associated with biological transfusions.'         Professor Cooper and his team have now applied for two patents for their approach to manipulate haemoglobin.         Other scientists are attempting a more ambitious approach by using stem cells - a basic cell which has the potential to develop into any other cell type in an organism - to grow replacement blood for patients.          Scientists at Edinburgh University have managed to harness blood stem cells from mice so that they multiply 150 times. They hope their findings will lead to transplantable blood stem cells that could multiply within the body and help renew patients' own blood supply.         Dr Lesley Forrester, a reader in stem cell biology at Edinburgh University who has been involved in the research, said: 'Ultimately we want to be able to grow blood stem cells from embryonic stem cells so they can be used as a treatment for patients.          Other groups in the United States have shown that it is possible to grow red blood cells in the laboratory from embryonic stem cells, but we still need to find out how these cells will behave in the body.'         A spokesman for NHS Blood and Transplant said that they were aware of concerns around the use of blood transfusions in routine surgery, but added: 'The current evidence is not sufficient to change policies and better clinical studies are required to answer this question.'         For surgeons, the artificial products are still too far in the future to help their current patients. Dr Gavin Murphy believes that simply using surgical techniques that reduce blood loss could help patients in many routine cases.          This would also mean that more donated blood would be available for emergency cases where transfusions can genuinely help to save lives. For emergency patients like Julie Henderson, the choice is clear.         'If someone had asked me, I would much rather have run the risk of complications after a transfusion than not have had one at all. Without the blood I was given, I wouldn't be here now, so it is crucial that people keep donating to ensure more lives can be saved.'         • For more information about NHS Blood and Transplant, visit their website www.nhsbt.nhs.uk or call them on 01923 486 800"
telegraph,31/08/2005 00:03,technology,"            Researchers could help eradicate devastating childhood metabolic disorders if given the legislative green light, reports Roger Highfield                  Behind the doors of the authority that licenses embryo research in Britain, an intense debate is taking place. Should scientists be allowed to carry out a new kind of genetic therapy, one that offers the first hope that an entire class of metabolic diseases could be wiped out?          What is fascinating about the proposal, a blend of IVF and gene transplant, is that if a baby girl is born as a result of this genetic therapy the beneficial effects would be passed down to future generations.          The proposal is radical because scientists have agonised for at least three decades over what is called 'germ-line' gene therapy - genetic changes passed on in eggs and sperm - and remain divided over whether it should be allowed.          On one side are those who would outlaw it because genes can interact in complicated ways and the eradication of certain so-called disease genes could have unexpected side effects. They fear errors in the resulting 'designer babies' could wreak havoc in a person's genetic legacy and pollute the human gene pool.          Against them in the debate are the pragmatists who say these are theoretical risks and should not be allowed to outweigh the very real potential of germ-line therapy to reduce human suffering.          But the new proposal, from a team at the University of Newcastle, is not like the usual brand of germ-line therapy - boys would not pass on the genetic change to their children - and marks another example where reproductive science outpaces legislation.          In the Newcastle proposal under consideration by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, the suffering in question is of children who are affected by 50 or so metabolic disorders linked to faults in a small set of genes that make and run the chemical 'batteries' that power cells.          These 37 genes are contained in mitochondria, lozenge-like structures, the legacy of when bacteria invaded the cells of our ancestors two billion years ago to trade chemical energy for a cosy home. Only 13 of these genes actually work in the conventional way to make proteins. However, mitochondria are crucial.          They provide the power for our bodies, from making hearts beat to helping us to think. And we only get our mitochondria, and their genes, from our mothers: every one of the 15,000 trillion that power your body is the descendant of the 400 or so mitochondria in an egg.          Compared with the 'nuclear' DNA coiled up in the chromosomes in the compartment (nucleus) in each cell, which describes the proteins that build and operate the rest of the body, mitochondrial DNA has been relatively neglected by scientists: there is no easy way to alter mitochondrial genes.          When there are faults in mitochondrial genes, the results can vary from mild to catastrophic. A woman with malfunctioning mitochondria can suffer only the occasional migraine. But, for reasons that are not understood, she can sometimes pass on many more of her mitochondrial defects to her children.          The resulting metabolic mayhem can cause the build-up of lactic acid that will damage the brain, muscle, heart and liver. In Britain alone, hundreds of families suffer as a result of these incurable diseases.          Why not trade the faulty mitochondria for good ones? That is precisely what is being proposed by Prof Doug Turnbull and embryologist Dr Mary Herbert, whose efforts in Newcastle have been backed by the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign.          Their proposal will involve taking the pronuclei - the chromosome-containing residues of the egg and sperm - out of a fertilised egg and transplanting them into an egg that has been donated from another woman, under informed consent.          The donor egg would have been 'enculeated' - emptied of its DNA within the nucleus but which still contains the cytoplasm, the jelly around the nucleus where the mitochondria sit. When the pronuclei are inserted into this enucleated egg, the result would be an embryo with the nuclear DNA from the parental egg and sperm but mitochondria - and mitochondrial DNA - from the donor egg.          The idea that this method could end mitochondrial disease has already been successfully tested in mice by Dr Lawrence Smith at the University of Montreal - who once worked with Prof Ian Wilmut, the head of the team that cloned Dolly the sheep - but it would take many years to perfect in humans.          Unfortunately for the Newcastle team, its proposal has been rejected twice already by the HFEA, which is nervous about how any approval would be portrayed by the media.          The cell surgery that Newcastle would use to trade faulty with normal mitochondria could be seen as a variant of the one used to clone Dolly the sheep. It has to be a variant because the process of 'nuclear transfer' is banned when it comes to making babies. But any proximity of the words 'cloning techniques' and 'baby' is enough to make many people nervous, particularly since Newcastle University has the first team in the west to clone human embryos.          In reality, however, the similarities rest only in details of the micromanipulation methods used to carry out surgery on cells that are around one tenth of a millimetre across. Babies that would be born after the Newcastle proposal are anything but clones; they would actually be conceived the normal way but would be powered by mitochondria from another woman.          Herein lies the second PR nightmare: the journalistic shorthand for offspring resulting this way is a 'baby with three parents' or a 'baby with two mothers'. The Newcastle team cringes at this description, since the nuclear DNA that really makes us who we are consists of around 25,000 genes, compared with the paltry 37 that our mothers pass to us in mitochondria.          The third objection rests on how this transplant of 37 genes is seen by some as tantamount to germ-line gene therapy. At present, scientists are only comfortable with carrying out gene transplants to fix genetic disease so long as they do not affect eggs and sperm. And usually gene therapy concerns fiddling with one or two genes, not 37. If the experience in America is anything to go by, it will end up being portrayed as germ-line therapy, even though this is not strictly true.          There was a furore when the first human mitochondrial transplants were carried out at the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science of St Barnabas in New Jersey, in a controversial fertility treatment known as cytoplasmic transfer, before the method had been tested properly on animals.          The cytoplasm carrying the mitochondria was removed from eggs from young donor women and injected into those of older women in a bid to make fertilisation more likely. As a result, the child's mitochondrial DNA was a blend of that from two women.          But there were no controls, the amount of cytoplasm that was transferred was small, and the evidence that it worked was unconvincing. Even though the Newcastle team has joined in the criticisms of this work, it was crudely branded germ-line therapy in the American media brouhaha.          An HFEA spokesman said that the Newcastle proposal has been rejected so far because the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 prohibits the genetic modification of the embryo. The team is expected to make a formal appeal at the end of September. Until a decision is reached by the HFEA, the team has told me that it does not want to discuss its proposal.          The Newcastle team has good reasons to battle on. What it wants to do is not like conventional germ-line therapy, since it would only affect future generations if used to free a baby girl of the disease. It is unlikely that the original intention behind the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act was to prevent such research, which was science fiction 15 years ago, marking yet another scientific reason why the 1990 Act is under review.          As if to highlight how attitudes are softening, a consultation document recently issued by the Government recommends that research on the use of cell nuclear replacement to treat mitochondrial disease should be allowed, subject to licensing. The same document says that germ-line changes should continue to be banned, suggesting that mitochondrial transplants are not germ-line changes.          In addition to patient groups such as the Children's Mitochondrial Disease Network, the Newcastle proposal also has powerful backers in the scientific establishment. 'I hope their appeal will be successful,' said Prof Anne McLaren of Cambridge University, a former member of the HFEA and a leading embryologist.          One problem, she said, is that the current wording of the 1990 Act makes any licence for this work vulnerable to legal challenge by pro-life groups. 'The HFEA is quite right to be cautious,' she said, adding that she hopes the revised Act will make this kind of treatment easier to license.          As for the claims that the resulting babies would have two mothers, Prof McLaren commented: 'I think two mothers might be even better than one mother. Speaking as a mother, I would have no problems with that. No problems at all.'          Even full blooded germ-line therapy - alteration of nuclear DNA - has powerful supporters, so long as it is safe. Prof James Watson, who shared the Nobel Prize for his work on DNA's double helix, is one enthusiastic proponent: DNA manipulation could be used to make people resistant to the ravages of HIV, or transform slow learners into fast ones, according to Watson, who has often voiced his backing for 'simply putting right what chance has put horribly wrong. You should be allowed to improve human life.''          At the end of 2002, the International Forum for Biophilosophy in Brussels saw delegates backing research leading toward safe and effective human germ-line genetic modification. They concluded that germ-line therapy does not violate human rights, including any 'so-called right to be born with a human genome that has not been modified by artificial means'."
telegraph,13/11/2006 00:01,news,"            Roger Highfield explains why the genetic code of the purple sea urchin could be a boon for human medicine.                  It may be spiny, grapefruit-sized and purple but scientists studying the genetic make-up of a spineless male sea urchin today hail the humble creature as a long-lost relative.         A team of 240 researchers from more than 70 institutions unveils the DNA code of the male California purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus to highlight remarkable similarities with humans and reveal that the creature functions as a simple eye.         After identifying 23,300 genes made from 814 million letters of DNA code taken from the urchin, the team reports today in the journal Science that humans share 7,077 genes with the urchins. They carry genes associated with many human diseases, such as muscular dystrophy and Huntington's disease. The urchin also has genes associated with taste and smell, hearing and balance.         Prof Maurice Elphick, from Queen Mary, University of London, says that the sea urchin genome is closer to humans than to other species such as worms and fruit flies: 'The comparison of the genes of the sea urchin to the human gene list shows which human genes are likely to be recent innovations in human evolution, and which are ancient. It also shows which human genes have changed slowly in the lineage from the common ancestor that lived 540 million years ago and which genes are evolving rapidly in response to natural selection.ant.'         'Using this kind of information, it will be possible one day to know the history of every human gene – and build a picture of what the extinct ancestors that gave rise to animal life from worms to humans may have looked like.'         One of the surprise discoveries was that sea urchins have a much more complex innate immune system than humans, which may explain why sea urchin species can have incredibly long life spans, with some individuals living for up to 200 years. Future research on this aspect of sea urchin biology may lead to breakthroughs in the fight against infectious diseases in humans, say the scientists.         One of the surprise discoveries was that sea urchins have a much more complex innate immune system than humans, which may explain why sea urchin species can have incredibly long life spans, with some individuals living for up to 200 years. Future research on this aspect of sea urchin biology may lead to breakthroughs in the fight against infectious diseases in humans, say the scientists.         Although the sea urchin has no eyes and ears, it was also found that it has genes for vision and hearing similar to those found in man and some of these are expressed in appendages known as tube feet, which are arranged in five rows extending over the surface of its spherical body.          Remarkably, it seems that the whole animal might be functioning as a simple eye. 'Nobody would've predicted that sea urchins have such a robust gene set for visual perception,' said Prof Gary Wessel of Brown University and member of the Sea Urchin Genome Sequencing Consortium. 'I've been looking at these organisms for 31 years – and now I know they were looking back at me.'          'It was interesting to identify genes that are missing in sea urchins,' adds Prof Elphick. 'For example, we found that sea urchins lack genes coding for gap junction proteins that enable rapid conduction of electrical signals between nerve cells in other animals. We don't know why sea urchins lack these genes:and perhaps others echinoderms lack gap junction genes; it may be because their ancestors just didn't need them for a sedentary way of life.'          The project was led by Erica Sodergren and George Weinstock, a husband-and-wife team at the Baylor College of Medicine-Human Genome Sequencing Centre, along with Richard Gibbs, and Eric Davidson and Andrew Cameron of the California Institute of Technology.          Sea urchins are echinoderms (Greek for spiny skin), marine animals that originated over 540 million years ago and that include starfish, brittle stars, sea lilies, and sea cucumbers. Following the great extinction of animals 250 million years ago, the modern sea urchins emerged as the dominant echinoderm species. The purple sea urchin emerged in the North Pacific Ocean during a rapid burst of speciation and diversification 15-20 million years ago.         Although invertebrate sea urchins have a radically different body plan from humans and other vertebrates, their embryonic development displays basic similarities, an important shared property of what are called Deuterostome animals. This distinguishes them from Protostomes, which have a different pattern of embryonic development.         'Each genome that we sequence brings new surprises. This analysis shows that sea urchins share substantially more genes and biological pathways with humans than previously suspected,' comments Francis Collins, director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute. 'Comparing the genome of the sea urchin with that of the human and other model organisms will provide scientists with novel insights into the structure and function of our own genome, deepening our understanding of the human body in health and disease.'"
telegraph,1/11/2007 0:01,culture,"            Terence Kealey reviews A Life Decoded:  My Genome, My Life by J. Craig Venter                   It was James Watson, of the famed Watson-Crick duo that discovered the structure of DNA, who supplied the standard description of Craig Venter: he was, Watson said, a DNA dictator who 'wanted to own the human genome the way Hitler wanted to own the world'.         Now Venter has written his own Mein Kampf and, worryingly, we can see similarities between the young Adolf and the young Craig.          Both were born to humble parents (Venter's father was a middling accountant) and each resented their father's tough discipline. Both, moreover, bummed around after leaving school, only finding their life's purpose after bitter war service (Vietnam in Venter's case). But thereafter they diverged because Venter did not like war and in consequence – sobered by the sight of so many broken bodies – he progressed to university to specialise in medical research.         He proved brilliant at it. Venter is like all the best biochemists – good with his hands, resourceful and very, very ambitious. By the 1970s he was publishing a paper every few weeks, making nice advances in hormone research. And during the 1980s, when DNA research opened up to the wider scientific community, Venter embraced the emerging field.         It was here that he encountered a problem: his own impatience. By the 1990s the big challenge in biology was the sequencing of the human genome, and the task was so huge that it was being managed globally across dozens of cooperating laboratories.          The technique being used, so-called chromosome walking, was equally methodical, being well-named: the scientists started at one end of the chromosome and sequenced stolidly along it.         Venter, however,wanted to move faster. He advocated a 'shot-gun' approach by which the genome was randomly cut up into pieces, the pieces were individually sequenced, and computers then analysed the overlapping parts of the random sequences to provide an overall map.         Unfortunately Venter could not persuade his government-funded colleagues in the universities or research institutes to agree, so he spun off into the private sector, helping create a company called Celera, as in 'accelerate'.          There he progressed so fast that the government-funded researchers were alarmed. Their measured bureaucratic approach was being overtaken and they were being forced into a race and they resented it.         Previously, they had been comfortable in their cosy cartel, floating on vast government funds, so they played dirty, claiming that Venter was 'stealing' four billion years of evolution by patenting the human genome.          Their argument was, of course, false because no pharmaceutical company can develop a new drug unless the science is patented: regardless of who sequences a gene, it must be patented if humanity is to benefit.         The government scientists' real concern was selfish. Ever since Francis Bacon wrote the Advancement of Learning in 1605, scientists have claimed that only governments could fund fundamental research. Now Venter was shifting the paradigm, and with it some comfortable berths.         Eventually a tie was declared, and on the 26 June,2000, in a shared announcement from the White House, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair acclaimed Craig Venter and Francis Collins (the leader of the government scientists) the joint winners of the race to determine the sequence of the human genome.          The only sour note was provided by an early draft of  Tony Blair's speech, which had been written by his court scientist, Bob May, and which failed to rise to the occasion.                     A Life Decoded is a brilliant book. Beautifully written, it is not only the most gripping but also the most important scientist's autobiography since James Watson's own Double Helix.          Its importance derives not from the details of Venter's messy private life (he seems to be an almost-intolerably alpha male who, in another departure from Hitler, is a serial divorcer and serial adulterer) nor from the details of  Venter's actual science (if Venter had never lived, the human genome would have been sequenced anyway, if a little less quickly) but – just as Watson provided in his own book – for the insight it provides into the mind of a paradigm-shifter.         Venter's real importance – one he seems not to recognise fully himself – is not that he raced some other scientists to a predictable goal, but that he ushered in the 21st century by shattering the 500-year assumption that businesses cannot do fundamental research. Yet they can, they do, and they will increasingly perform more and more of it.         Half a century ago James Watson, with government money, helped change the way we view Nature. Now Craig Venter, with private money, has helped change the way we do science.          The two men are mirror-images of each other, separated only by their eras, not their personalities. "
telegraph,28/11/2006 00:01,news,"            Work at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London could mean the end to heart transplant rejection, says Roger Highfield                  Romantics have spent centuries debating how to mend a broken heart. Now the answer to this elusive question has been found by scientists in London. The secret depends on reliving the past – capturing a fleeting moment in the womb when this amazing biological pump was still being shaped by complex genetic and biomechanical forces.          Poets and philosophers know that it is impossible to recreate a moment. But for a molecular biologist like Paul Riley it is possible to restore some of the molecular machinery that once turned when this organ was forming within the unborn child, as juvenile cells began to change into the blend of muscle, nerve and blood vessel in a mature heart.          The chemistry of the unborn heart is quite different from that of the adult organ. A spectrum of molecular signals is at work to guide the complex origami that shapes the foetal heart and forms its chambers. Genes are blinking on and off all the time.          For example, one called Hand1 plays a role in looping, where the three-week-old human heart bends outward and rotates to the right in a balletic move that must happen to avoid misconnections of arteries, holes and congenital heart disease.          To investigate how a heart grows, Dr Riley used mice which, at the genetic level, are pretty much little humans, save their tails, brains and sense of smell, and revealed the role of a key choreographer of the cardiac developmental dance, called thymosin ß4.          For the study, published in Nature, the team used mice that had been bred to lack this particular protein. They found that the hearts of these mice did not develop normally: the muscle showed early signs of tissue loss and blood vessel development was poor.          Closer examination revealed that without thymosin ß4, a class of immature cells failed to move deeper into the heart and change into the cells needed to build healthy blood vessels and sustain pumping heart muscle.          The work by Dr Riley's team at the UCL Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street, London, is fascinating for a number of reasons. The study shows how little we understand about the way cells develop distinct personalities in the body, whether heart, brain or liver. Embryonic stem cells can turn into all 200 or so cell types.          These are distinguished from more mature 'adult' stem cells, which can also be grown in the lab, but develop into a smaller repertoire. Then there are the progenitor cells that feature in this study which do not multiply in the lab unless they are exposed to signals such as thymosin ß4, when they can also change into other types, in this case into blood vessels.          The protein could also help to solve a mystery about how experimental stem cell treatments work. Animal tests show that stem cells – bone marrow cells with the potential to turn into many types – can be infused into a heart after an attack and help it to grow strong again.          But whether these stem cells heal by making more muscle or more blood vessels is unknown. Now, as trials of stem cells are under way in London, scientists can also study whether these cells work by infusing the damaged area with thymosin ß4 and making progenitor cells carry out the repair.          Before this work, it was thought that cells within the adult heart are in a state of permanent rest and that any progenitor cells that could contribute to heart tissue repair came from elsewhere, such as the bone marrow.          Dr Riley's research, funded by the British Heart Foundation and the Medical Research Council, demonstrates that these beneficial healing cells actually reside in the heart and confirm that we have a long way to go to understand how a single fertilised egg develops into a complex cellular community of trillions.          The work could help save lives. When progenitor cells taken from the exterior of the heart were exposed to thymosin ß4 they had as much potential as embryonic cells to create healthy heart tissue. The value of activating these cells had been highlighted by earlier work at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, Dallas, which revealed that the protein enables muscle cells to survive after a heart attack. The British research shows how – the protein instals new plumbing to nourish an ailing heart.          'Blood vessel regeneration is still possible in the adult heart,' said Dr Riley. 'If we can figure out how to direct the progenitor cells using thymosin ß4, there could be potential for therapy based on the patients' own heart cells. This approach would bypass the risk of rejection, a major problem with the use of stem cell transplants from another source.          And, it has the added benefit that the cells are already in the right place – within the heart itself. All these cells need is the appropriate instructions to guide them towards new blood vessel formation that will help in the repair of muscle damage following a heart attack.'          Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said the work is 'important and exciting – Dr Riley's group has taken a large step towards practical therapy to encourage damaged hearts to repair themselves, a goal that researchers are urgently aiming for'.          'Finding out how this protein helps to heal the heart offers enormous potential in fighting heart disease, which kills more than 105,000 people in the UK every year,' said Prof Colin Blakemore, chief executive of the Medical Research Council.          Within a decade, some of the 300,000 Britons who have a heart attack every year could benefit from this discovery, according to Dr Riley. Current treatments for a damaged heart are limited by the ability of the adult tissue to respond: there is a hint that thymosin ß4 manufacture is ramped up in response, though not in sufficient amounts to make a difference.          By fully reactiviating this embryonic protein to guide progenitor cells from the rind of the heart to form new blood vessels within, it could be possible to restore blood flow to muscle that has been starved of oxygen.          Although there is still a way to go from mice to men, Dr Riley believes that his discovery will eventually help to mend a broken heart."
telegraph,20/08/2007 00:01,news," A vaccine to cut the risk of becoming overweight could be ready for testing within the next five years, according to research that suggests obesity can sometimes be catching.          A common virus may be one factor that contributes to the obesity epidemic sweeping the west, according to the research in the United States.                                        Although there is overwhelming evidence that obesity is linked to eating too many calories or burning too few, other factors are now thought to play a role, from lack of sleep to changes in stomach bacteria and now, thanks to new experiments, a common virus.              Obese people sometimes blame glands, metabolism or 'heavy bones' for their weight problem.             This study gives up to 30 per cent of them a new excuse - they 'caught' their obesity in much the same way as they might catch a common cold.          In experiments, scientists in Louisiana showed that infection with human adenovirus-36 (Ad-36), long recognised as a cause of colds and eye infections,  transforms adult stem cells obtained from fat tissue into fat cells, whereas stem cells not exposed to the virus were unchanged.           The study was conducted at Pennington Biomedical Research Centre, Baton Rouge, USA by Dr Magdalena Pasarica in a lab led by Dr Nikhil Dhurandhar.          In addition, the study reported a virus gene that appears to be involved in this obesity-promoting effect.            The findings were presented  by Dr Pasarica in Boston at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society.          Dr Dhurandhar told The Daily Telegraph that  more work must be done but he could envisage a vaccine aimed at 'this kind of obesity' - what he calls 'infectobesity' -  ready for tests within five or 10 years.           Dr Pasarica  said:  'Not all infected people will could develop obesity.         'We're not saying that a virus is the only cause of obesity, but this study provides stronger evidence that some obesity cases may involve viral infections.'           However, she added that  'we first need to prove that Ad-36 causes human obesity.'             Although it is unethical to deliberately infect people to cause obesity to show the link, evidence of the link is growing, she said.           'We would ultimately like to identify the underlying factors that predispose some obese people to develop obesity after infection with this virus and eventually find a way to treat it.'             As for the importance of the viral link, Dr Dhurandhar carried out an earlier study - the first to associate a virus with human obesity - showing 30 per cent of obese people were infected with the Ad-36 virus in comparison to 11 per cent of non obese individuals.            In the  new study, Dr Pasarica and her associates obtained adult stem cells from fatty tissue from patients who had undergone liposuction.          Half of the stem cells were exposed to the virus and the other half were not.   After about a week of growth in tissue culture, most of the virus-infected adult stem cells developed into fat cells, whereas the non-infected stem cells did not.           The exact mechanism by which the virus might cause obesity in people is currently unknown, says Dr Pasarica, who does not rule out the possibility that other human viruses may also contribute to obesity.           Researchers also do not know how long the virus remains in the body of obese individuals nor how long its fat-enhancing effect lasts once the virus is gone.            However, Dr Pasarica notes that a recent study demonstrated how animals that developed the virus remained obese up to six months after their infection was gone.            Scientists are now in the process of trying to identify the factors that predispose some people with the virus to develop obesity while others do not."
telegraph,5/2/2013 10:08,news,"A 3D printing technique that produces clusters of stem cells could speed up progress towards the creation of artificial organs, scientists claim.In the more immediate future it could be used to generate biopsy-like tissue   samples for drug testing.The technique relies on an adjustable 'microvalve' to build up layers of human   embryonic stem cells (hESCs).Altering the nozzle diameter precisely controls the rate at which cells are   dispensed.Lead scientist Dr Will Shu, from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, said:   'We found that the valve-based printing is gentle enough to maintain high   stem cell viability, accurate enough to produce spheroids of uniform size,   and most importantly, the printed hESCs maintained their pluripotency - the   ability to differentiate into any other cell type.'Embryonic stem cells, which originate from early stage embryos, are blank   slates with the potential to become any type of tissue in the body.The research is reported today in the journal Biofabrication.In the long term, the new printing technique could pave the way for hESCs   being incorporated into transplant-ready laboratory-made organs and tissues,   said the researchers.The 3D structures will also enable scientists to create more accurate human   tissue models for drug testing.Cloning technology can produce embryonic stem cells, or cells with ESC   properties, containing a patient's own genetic programming.Artificial tissue and organs made from such cells could be implanted into the   patient from which they are derived without triggering a dangerous immune   response.Jason King, business development manager of stem cell biotech company Roslin   Cellab, which took part in the research, said: 'Normally laboratory grown   cells grow in 2D but some cell types have been printed in 3D. However, up to   now, human stem cell cultures have been too sensitive to manipulate in this   way.'This is a scientific development which we hope and believe will have   immensely valuable long-term implications for reliable, animal-free, drug   testing, and, in the longer term, to provide organs for transplant on   demand, without the need for donation and without the problems of immune   suppression and potential organ rejection.'

There is no cure and many will not survive beyond the age of 40.Scroll down for video The condition, which is caused by the faulty gene CFTR, leads to recurring chest infections and patients have to undergo physiotherapy up to four times a day to clear their lungs.Scientists from Oxford University and Imperial College London have developed a treatment which repairs the faulty CFTR gene by adding a healthy gene on top, the Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal reported.Patients inhale a virus, delivered via a nebuliser, which contains the healthy gene and ensures it reaches the cells in the lungs where it is needed.Once inside the cells, the healthy genes help them function properly and clear mucus from the lungs. The treatment is still in the early stages of development and has been tested on only a few patients.Professor Eric Alton, of Imperial College London, said: ‘Patients who received the gene therapy showed a significant, if modest, benefit. The results are encouraging.’A treatment for cystic fibrosis that repairs faulty genes has offered hope for thousands of patients.The findings from a landmark British study show it significantly improved the working of patients’ lungs and prevented them succumbing to chest infections.The condition affects 10,000 patients in the UK and, as there is currently no cure, many will not survive beyond the age of 40.It leads to recurring chest infections and patients have to undergo physiotherapy on their chests up to four times a day to clear their lungs.The illness is caused by the faulty gene CFTR which results in their lungs filling with sticky mucus, eventually destroying them.A team of scientists from Oxford University and Imperial  has developed a treatment which works by repairing this faulty gene by adding a healthy gene on top, to correct it.Patients inhale a virus, delivered via a nebuliser, which contains the healthy gene and ensures it reaches the cells in the lungs where it is needed.Once inside the cells, the healthy genes help them function properly and clear mucus from the lungs.The treatment, referred to as gene therapy, is still in the very early stages of development and has so far only been tested on a few patients.In the first trial to assess this type of gene treatment, researchers compared its use with standard drugs on 136 patients with cystic fibrosis over the course of a year.Half were given the gene therapy once a month through a nebuliser and the other half were given a placebo, or dummy drug.The experiment took place at two hospitals, the Royal Brompton, in London and the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh between June 2012 and 2013.Its findings, published today in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, show that the lungs of patients who were given the drugs function better than those who received the placebo.One measurement showed that their average lung function had deteriorated by 0.4 per cent over a year compared to 4 per cent for the other patients.The researchers said the results were a ‘landmark’ and although the benefits were ‘modest’, they were ‘significant’.Professor Alton, who specialises in gene therapy and respiratory medicine at Imperial, and is a consultant at the Royal Brompton Hospital, said: ‘Patients who received the gene therapy showed a significant, if modest, benefit in tests of lung function compared with the placebo group; there were no safety concerns.‘Whilst the effect was inconsistent, with some patients responding better than others, the results are encouraging, laying the groundwork for further trials which we hope could improve the effect.‘Publication of this trial is a landmark for cystic fibrosis patients and we are particularly grateful to the many patients across the UK who gave their time and effort to participate and make this collaborative venture a success.‘Our aim is to achieve a step change in the treatment of CF that focuses on the basic defect rather than just addressing the symptoms.‘It has taken more than 20 years to get where we are now, and there is still some way to go.‘Eventually we hope gene therapy will push CF patients towards a normal life expectancy and improve their quality of life significantly.’The researchers plan to carry out a larger trial next year to further test how well the treatment works.Although there is still no cure for cystic fibrosis, new drugs mean that the average life expectancy has increased from under ten years in the 1960s to 40 or 50 years for babies born today.Current treatments include enzymes, proteins, or salt solutions which are inhaled through nebulisers to help thin and clear mucus from the lungs.George Freeman, Minister for Life Sciences, said: ‘Cystic fibrosis can have a devastating effect on patients and families and this is an excellent development for people living with the condition.'"
telegraph,26/07/2012 06:30,news,"A British boy who had his defective windpipe replaced with one grown using his own stem cells is growing into a healthy teenager following a world-first operation. Before Ciaran Finn-Lynch had the operation in London, doctors thought he could   die at any moment. He was born with a windpipe just one millimetre wide and only survived his   first 11 years thanks to a series of metal devices, called stents, to hold   his airway open. However, these repeatedly burrowed into a major blood vessel causing massive   bleeding. One more such bleed and he could have died. Then, two years ago, transplant specialists proposed a pioneering technique   that involved covering a donor windpipe with Ciaran’s own stem cells. It was the boy’s only option, doctors said, but had the added advantage that   he would not need to take immunosuppressant drugs. The family immediately agreed and the operation took place at Great Ormond   Street Hospital in March 2010. Since then Ciaran, from County Down in Northern Ireland, has grown almost   four-and-a-half inches (11cm) and he has returned to school. He has also   been able to develop his musical interest as a drummer. A medical update is   published in The Lancet today. His family has declined to be interviewed, but at the time of the operation   his mother Colleen said she and her husband Paul had “got our boy back”. The procedure involved taking a windpipe from a 30-year-old Italian woman who   had died and stripping it of living cells down to the inert collagen   ‘scaffold’. Four weeks later, Ciaran’s windpipe was removed. Sections of its lining were   taken off and kept and the rest discarded. Bone marrow from Ciaran was   harvested and the stem cells isolated. The same day, the donor windpipe was inserted into Ciaran’s neck and his stem   cells sprayed on to it. Tiny sections of lining from his original windpipe were patched on to the   replacement. These prompted the stem cells to turn into the right kind of   tissue and kick-started growth of the windpipe lining. Finally, the graft was injected with proteins to stimulate cell growth and   differentiation, called cytokines. The operation was the first attempt to grow stem cells in place in the body of   a child, rather than growing an organ in a laboratory ‘bioreactor’. It came only two years after the first windpipe replacement using stem cells   in an adult, although in that case, carried out in Barcelona, the organ was   grown in the lab. Ciaran was also fitted with a biodegradeable stent to keep his airway open for   the first six months while the windpipe grew into place. After the operation the doctors who conducted it described it as “a kind of   miracle”. Professor Martin Elliott, who led the transplant team at Great Ormond Street,   said yesterday: “The ideal outcomes for tracheal transplants in children are   normal airway and lung function, good general growth, a decent quality of   life, and no further surgical interventions. “So far we have achieved this, but we are at the edge of medicine and,   similarly to first attempts of organ transplantation in the 1950s, many   challenges remain. “A second child has since undergone a tracheal transplant at GOSH. Although   the graft preparation and the surgery were completed successfully, the child   sadly passed away at a later date.”Martin Birchall, professor of laryngology at the University College London Ear   Institute, said: “We need more research on stem cells grown deliberately   inside the body, rather than grown first in a laboratory over a long time. “This research should help to convert one-off successes into more widely   available clinical treatments for thousands of children with severe tracheal   problems worldwide.”The doctors hope that in future they will be able to grow more complex organs   including replacement hearts and intestines. However, they think such   intricate “tissue engineering” is still many years away. "
telegraph,28/06/2003 00:01,news,"A British team of doctors is about to pass another medical milestone by treating children with an inherited disorder of the immune system using gene therapy.The plan to transplant genes into five children is significant because it marks a renewed attempt to treat ADA deficiency, called bubble baby syndrome because victims must be protected in a sterile environment. The syndrome was targeted in the world's first gene therapy trials, all of which failed.The Great Ormond Street team in London is one of only three worldwide to have reported success with the therapy, among hundreds of failed attempts, after it used gene transplants to treat four children who had another form of immune deficiency. Despite concerns, raised when gene therapy was linked to two cases of leukaemia, Prof Adrian Thrasher and Dr Bobby Gaspar remain confident about the future of transplanting 'healthy' genes to replace defective DNA.Compared with the first organ transplants, the first gene transplants have been highly regulated and proved remarkably safe - more so than alternative treatments available to these seriously ill children, they said.Boys and girls who have the bubble baby disease lack the gene for an enzyme called adenosine deaminase (ADA) so they suffer abnormalities of the immune system, a 'severe combined immunodeficiency' or SCID.In the wake of success by Italian doctors, the London team is to launch an ADA trial on children who cannot find a bone marrow donor with a good tissue match and who do not respond well to PEG-ADA, a drug used to replace the missing enzyme.Boys and girls have yet to be recruited for the trial, in which bone marrow will be extracted and mingled in sterile blood bags with a genetically engineered mouse virus containing a normal copy of the ADA gene.Before the doctors transfuse the modified bone marrow back into each child, they will take a radical step, neglected in earlier attempts, now thought crucial: they will end treatment with PEG-ADA and subject the children to mild chemotherapy to suppress defective bone marrow cells and, in effect, 'create space' for the transfused GM cells to multiply.Because of the leukaemia problem, the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee has insisted that approval must be sought for each of the five children.All had their immune systems wrecked by a defect in, or lack of, the 'gamma c' gene. The first transplant patient, Rhys Evans, remains healthy with no signs of the inherited disorder that had confined him to the solitary world of an antiseptic hospital room.However, problems have been identified by Prof Alain Fischer of the Necker Hospital, Paris, who has used a similar approach on 11 X-SCID children. Two developed leukaemia, a known risk given that the virus used for gene therapy can disrupt genes by inserting a new one.However, the two children are now in remission and gene therapy still provides a safer alternative to bone marrow transplants from a parent or mismatched unrelated donor, said Prof Thrasher.'We would have expected four or five deaths if we had taken that approach,' he said. 'Gene therapy is not a tragedy at all but an incredible new treatment. We know there are problems but, as with any new therapy, we will learn how to rectify them.'Although the trial follows a cash boost announced this week in a White Paper, it will still mostly be funded by charities, notably the Jeans for Genes appeal. The Government has given some support to the ADA study but allocated only £3 million for all 4,000 of what are called 'single gene' disorders."
dailymail,23/04/2015 23:26,wires,"A first attempt to create genetically modified (GM) human embryos has been made by Chinese scientists in a move that has prompted a call for a worldwide ban on the creation of 'designer babies'.The researchers used a molecular cut and paste technique to edit DNA at specific locations in order to remove and replace a problem gene.Their aim was to modify the gene responsible for beta-thalassaemia, a potentially fatal inherited blood disorder.But the experiment, conducted on 'non-viable' human embryos, proved unsuccessful. Of 86 embryos treated, only 28 were spliced and a fraction of those were found to contain the replacement genetic material.Nevertheless, the research published in the online journal Protein & Cell, is hugely controversial because it crosses what for many is a scientific red line.Commenting on the development, Dr David King, director of the watchdog group Genetics Alert, said: 'This news emphasises the need for an immediate global ban on the creation of GM designer babies.'It is critical that we avoid a eugenic future in which the rich can buy themselves a baby with built-in genetic advantages. If China does not want to get the reputation of being the wild west of the new eugenics it must join the many countries including the UK which would ban such research.'Details of the research were brought to mainstream attention by the journal Nature in an online news article.It quoted lead scientist Dr Junjiu Huang, from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, saying: 'If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%. That's why we stopped. We think it's too immature.'The technique, known as CRISPR/Cas9, involved injecting very early single-cell embryos with an enzyme complex that precisely binds and splices DNA.It can be programmed to target a problem gene which is replaced or repaired by another molecule introduced at the same time.Although well studied in human adult cells and animal embryos, there have been no published reports until now of its use in human embryos.Dr Huang's group used the technique to edit a gene called HBB, which codes for the human beta-globin protein. Mutations in this gene are the cause of beta-thalassaemia.Embryos were obtained from fertility clinics and had an extra set of chromosomes which meant they could undergo the first stages of development without resulting in a live birth.Dr George Daley, a stem cell biologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, US, told Nature: 'I believe this is the first report of CRISPR/Cas9 applied to human pre-implantation embryos and as such the study is a landmark, as well as a cautionary tale.'Their (the Chinese team) study should be a stern warning to any practitioner who thinks the technology is ready for testing to eradicate disease genes.'The scientists found a surprising number of 'off-target' mutations that were assumed to have been introduced by the editing complex acting on other parts of the genome, or genetic code.'This effect is one of the main safety concerns surrounding germline gene editing because these unintended mutations could be harmful,' said the Nature article.Germline genes are those that can be passed onto future generations in eggs and sperm.The rate of mutations was said to be much higher than those seen in gene-editing studies of mouse embryos or human adult cells.Dr Huang admitted that not all the unintended mutations were likely to have come to light because the study only focused on a portion of the genome.'If we did the whole genome sequence, we would get many more,' he said.The Chinese scientists maintain that their paper was rejected by the prestigious journals Nature and Science in part because of ethical objections.Nature declined to comment on the claim to its news journalists, who are editorially independent from the team that publishes scientific research.Dr Huang is said to be considering several different strategies to reduce the number of off-target mutations which he hopes to test on adult human cells or animal models.Dr King pointed out that China already had a law compelling women pregnant with a genetically disabled child to have an abortion. Chinese scientists were also allegedly involved in research to identify high IQ genes.'Western governments must finally put pressure on China to change its policies in this area if it wants to be a respectable part of the international community,' Dr King added.'The research demonstrates the safety pitfalls of these techniques and is entirely unnecessary since there are already many ethical ways to avoid thalassaemia. This research is a classic example of scientific careerism - assuring one's place in the history books even though the research is unnecessary and unethical.'Tampering with the germline is currently illegal in the UK with one exception. In an historic decision taken in February, MPs and peers voted to allow the donor replacement of mitochondrial DNA - genetic material contained in tiny cellular power plants - in order to prevent hereditary diseases.However, mitochondrial DNA accounts for a minute fraction of the genetic code and is very different from the DNA in the cell nucleus which determines personal traits such as height, eye colour and personality.British experts said the new research underlined the need for caution when considering applications for powerful gene editing technology.Alastair Kent, director of Genetic Alliance UK, a charity supporting families with genetic conditions, said:  'Families with a life-limiting genetic disease reading of this research will be interested to learn that it has been done, but will be only too aware of the scientific difficulties that will need to be overcome, and the ethical challenges that will need to be resolved, before it could be postulated as a potential therapeutic intervention for use in embryos destined for implantation in a woman through IVF.'If there is to be further development of this work it will be essential that the experimental data is fully accessible so the methodology can be scrutinised carefully before further work that moves this closer to patients is contemplated.'Failure to do this will render patients and families vulnerable, and risk bringing the wider field of gene transfer for serious diseases into disrepute.'Dr Philippa Brice, from the genomics think tank the PHG Foundation, said: ' This story underlines the urgent necessity for international dialogue over the ethics of germline gene editing in human embryos, well in advance of any progression towards theoretical clinical application.'Recent calls for a moratorium on any such research to allow time for expert and public consideration of what is and is not ethically, socially and indeed legally acceptable with respect to human germline genetic modification should definitely be heeded.'Professor Darren Griffin, a genetics scientist from the University of Kent, said: ' Given the widespread use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, such announcement was inevitable, sooner rather than later. We clearly have a lot of thinking to do. Germline manipulation is currently illegal in the UK but the question is bound to be asked whether this should change, especially if the safety concerns are allayed.'If the technology is proved to be safe, then the question moves to whether it crosses a moral boundary to apply this technology in the clinic. Equally, some will ask if the procedure is safe, do we have a moral imperative to make sure that we do it.'Professor Shirley Hodgson, an expert in cancer genetics at St George's, University of London, said: ' I think that this is a significant departure from currently accepted research practice. This is because any manipulation of the germline of human embryos is potentially heritable. Can we be certain that the embryos that the researchers were working on were indeed non-viable?'In the past all the gene therapy research that has been approved by regulatory bodies has been somatic, not germline, because of the potentially unpredictable and heritable effects of germline research. The fact that these researchers found that there were a number of 'off-target' mutations resulting from the technique they used is clearly a worry in this context.'Any proposal to do germline genetic manipulation should be very carefully considered by international regulatory bodies before it should be considered as a serious research prospect.'Coincidentally, news of the Chinese research came as US scientists reported using a different gene editing technique to prevent the transmission of defective mitochondria.These experiments, carried out at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, were performed on mice, not human embryos.The 'proof of concept' study published in the journal Cell selectively prevented mutated mitochondrial DNA linked to human diseases being passed from female mice to their offspring.Researcher Dr Alejandro Ocampo said: 'The clinical application of our technique does not require donor eggs. We are just performing a single injection into the patient's egg or one-cell embryo, which is technically easier than mitochondrial replacement.'"
dailymail,11/8/2015 0:39,health,"A jab of frozen tissue from placenta could be a new way to tackle arthritis in the knee.A one-off injection of placenta and amniotic fluid donated from women after childbirth is being given to patients to see if the cells can repair or reverse damage caused by the condition.More than a million people a year consult their GP about osteoarthritis, which is characterised by damage in and around a joint. As a result of wear and tear, the cartilage, the strong, smooth surface that lines bones and allows joints to move easily, is worn away.In response to the pain and inflammation, the body also produces bony growths, or spurs, to protect itself.The problem is that the joint cartilage is poorly supplied by blood vessels and nerves, and cannot repair itself.Painkillers, physiotherapy and steroids are among treatments available, but some people will eventually need partial or total knee replacements.Each year, more than 40,000 knee replacements are carried out in Britain.The new treatment uses stem cells from the amniotic membrane and fluid derived from the inner layer of the placenta, which surrounds a baby in pregnancy. Animal studies have suggested it can be highly effective in boosting healing and encouraging cartilage to regenerate.Researchers at Texas University found in a trial with 55 patients that one stem cell injection after surgery provided pain relief and helped regrowth of damaged tissue better than those not given the treatment, says the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.Now 150 people with moderate knee osteoarthritis are taking part in a trial at New York University and other centres, where the jab is being compared with a placebo.Stem cells in the foetus have the potential to develop into any type of cells, while adult stem cells are restricted to particular tissues and organs.Some stem cell research is controversial because it can involve early human embryos. But cells from the amniotic membrane and fluid can be easily collected from tissue usually discarded after birth.In the new trial, patients with osteoarthritis will be given either injections of amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid stem cells, placebo cells or hyaluronic acid, which is designed to replace hyaluronan, a thick liquid that naturally helps to lubricate joints and is already used to treat arthritis.The patients will then be monitored for a year.Commenting on the new study, Jane Tadman, from the charity Arthritis Research UK, said: 'Stem cell treatment for knee osteoarthritis has huge potential, although it's at an early experimental stage.'   "

This marks the third animal-human hybrid embryo licence to be issued by Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the first since the Commons voted in favour of this controversial research last month.         An HFEA spokesman said it had approved an application from the Clinical Sciences Research Institute, University of Warwick, for the creation of hybrid embryos. The centre has been offered a 12 month licence with effect from today, July 1.         The effort at the University of Warwick is led by Professor Justin St John. 'This new license allows us to attempt to make human pig clones to produce embryonic stem cells,' he said, where embryonic stem cells are able to turn into the 200 plus types in the body.

'We will take skin cells from patients who have a mutation for certain kinds of heart disease (cardiomyopathy, which makes the heart lose its pumping strength) and put them into pig eggs after their chromosomes have been removed. We will then make embryos so that we can attempt to derive embryonic stem cells which will allow us to study some of the molecular mechanisms associated with these heart diseases.          'Ultimately they will help us to understand where some of the problems associated with these diseases arise and they could also provide models for the pharmaceutical industry to test new drugs. We will effectively be creating and studying these diseases in a dish.           'But it's important to say that we're at the very early stages of this research and it will take a considerable amount of time. There is still a great deal to learn about these techniques and much of our early work will involve understanding how we can make the hybrid cloning process as efficient as possible.'         The study is aimed at understanding the way power-producing structures in cells, called mitochondria, are passed from egg to embryo.In the hybrid, the mitochondria mostly come from the egg, initially making up around half of the DNA by weight, and the team will do experiments in order to ensure that the trace of human mitochondrial DNA takes over, not least because it is designed to work with human nuclear DNA.          'The key thing we are doing is trying to create stem cells without any animal DNA in them. So even though these hybrid embryos normally have a small percentage of animal DNA , we are hoping to create cells that would have human chromosomes and human mitochondrial DNA.'The reason is that, as the team puts it, 'mixing of these two diverse populations of mitochondria can be detrimental to cellular function.'         Dr Evan Harris, Liberal Democrat science spokesman, commenting on the HFEA decision to issue a license to the University of Warwick to create hybrid embryos combining human skin cells with enucleated pig eggs, said: 'This application is a further indication of the interest in this sort of research by UK scientists, the decision of the HFEA to issue a license following stringent checks demonstrates that it is considered both necessary and ethical.'          'While this approval comes under the existing 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, both houses of Parliament have recently voted by large majorities to allow it into the future,' saidProf Robin Lovell-Badge, of the MRC National Institute For Medical Research.           'It is good news that this license has been issued at a time when parliament has expressed overwhelming support for this research after an excellent public debate. I suspect other similar applications will follow and hopefully this research can now progress without the hype.'            Teams in Newcastle and London are already creating hybrids. The former have already created hybrids with cow eggs to study the basics of how the use of genes changes in early development, the latter a range of species to generate stem cells from people with neurodegenerative disorders.

Researchers were able to successfully transform cells from patients as old as   100 into stem cells virtually identical to those found in embryos. If these can be used to grow healthy tissue which can safely be transplanted   into elderly patients it could open up new avenues of treatment for the   elderly. Jean-Marc Lemaître of the University of Montpellier, who led the research,   said: 'This is a new paradigm for cell rejuvenation ... the age of   cells is definitely not a barrier to reprogramming.' Embryonic stem cells can grow into any type of tissue in the body, and   scientists hope they could one day be used to replace diseased organs with   healthy, lab-grown replacements. But their use in medicine is controversial because it involves the destruction   of human embryos, albeit at a very early stage. As an alternative scientists can use a method of taking normal cells from   adults and reversing them to an unspecialised state, known as induced   pluripotent stem cells (iPS), making them almost indistinguishable from   embryonic stem cells. But experts are divided over whether the technique can work efficiently in   elderly patients, who have the most to gain from the potential treatments,   because their cells have deteriorated further.By adding two new ingredients, known as transcription factors, to the method   of generating adult stem cells, they were able to overcome this hurdle and 'reset'   many of the key markers of ageing in cells.There is a long way to go before the 'proof of concept', reported in   the Genes & Development journal, could be translated into treatments,   the team said. Mick Bhatia, director of the Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute at   McMaster University in Canada, said: 'Some people report that the older the   person, the more difficult it is to generate iPS but other labs suggest that   that is not the case at all.'I think it is certainly interesting that they are saying some of these age   markers reversed and the age programming has made the cells youthful, but I   think the proof comes down to showing that that does not happen normally   when you make iPS, that this is something unique in an aged individual.'"
telegraph,29/03/2005 00:01,news,"A new strain of genetically modified rice that could improve the sight of thousands of children in the third world has been developed by British scientists.          The 'golden rice' produces large amounts of beta-carotene which the body converts into vitamin A.          The World Health Organisation says that about 500,000 children go blind every year because of a lack of vitamin A in their diets.          The rice, developed at the British laboratories of the biotechnology company Syngenta, produces around 20 times as much beta-carotene as previous strains.          Syngenta is providing the rice free to research centres across Asia which will begin field trials if their governments give permission.          Golden rice was first developed by scientists in Switzerland five years ago and was hailed as a solution to the problem of vitamin A deficiency. But that strain did not produce enough beta-carotene to meet a child's daily needs.          Environmental campaigners responded cautiously to the research, which was published in the journal Nature Biotechnology.          Golden rice alone could not solve the problem of vitamin A deficiency, they said. It was better for children to have a balanced diet to ensure that they could absorb and use the vitamin A.          Clare Oxborrow, of Friends of the Earth, said yesterday: 'Vitamin A deficiency and the blindness that results from it is a huge problem in developing countries.          'However, the cause of it is not just the fact that rice is deficient in vitamin A; it is that the underlying poverty and malnutrition causes people to be deficient in a whole range of nutrients, including vitamin A.          'For people to absorb and use the vitamin A from the golden rice, they would need to have a lot of other nutrients in their diet, such as zinc.          'We want to see more political will addressing the underlying causes of poverty and malnutrition and focusing on trying to encourage people to grow a diverse range of fruit and vegetables.'          She said the rice must be rigorously tested for safety. Ingo Potrykus, who created the original strain, praised the British scientists.          Mr Potrykus, the chairman of an association that hopes to take the crop to third world farmers, said: 'We are determined to bring this benefit to people deficient in vitamin A. Syngenta's contribution is very helpful to our project.'"
telegraph,26/09/2001 00:01,news,"A PIONEERING form of gene therapy that reprogrammes the faulty immune systems of dangerously sick children is offering new hope to the parents of 'babies in bubbles'.In the first trial of its kind in Britain, 10 babies with two types of potentially fatal immune system disease will be given the treatment.If the therapy is a success, it could soon be extended to other genetic diseases and could one day bring an end to bone marrow transplants.Five of the babies in the tests suffer from a form of SCID, or severe combined immunodeficiency.These 'babies in bubbles' produce no lymphocytes and have no defence against infection. They must be isolated from the outside world and are likely to die within a year without a bone marrow transplant.The version of the disease being treated, called X-SCID, affects only boys and is caused by a single faulty gene.The other babies suffer from X linked Chronic Granulomatous Disorder, or X- CGD, another single gene disease caused by faulty bone marrow. These children produce faulty phagocytes, cells that normally engulf bacteria or fungal infections.The treatment is taking place at a new £150,000 laboratory at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, partly funded by the Jeans for Genes charity and the Institute for Child Health.Last year a team in Paris successfully modified the genes of babies with SCID, restoring the immune system of four out of five children.The London team will use a similar technique - removing bone marrow from the babies and isolating the stem cells that make all the other cells in blood.Using a genetically modified retrovirus, similar to the cold virus, they will insert healthy versions of the genes into the bone marrow stem cells. The repaired bone marrow will then be transfused back into the babies.Once inside the body, the healthy bone marrow stem cells will soon outnumber the faulty versions.Dr Adrian Thrasher, who is leading the trial, said he was 'very happy' with the first results. He believes that a single treatment will provide a life long cure.Around one in 50,000 babies are born with SCID, while one in 200,000 has CGD. The success rate of bone marrow transplants can be as low as 60 per cent, compared to 80 per cent when gene therapy was tested in Paris.Patient groups saw the trials as a milestone. Fiona Sandford, from the Primary Immunodeficiency Association, (PiA) said: 'It gives tremendous hope to these families.'Suzanne Drew, whose daughter Aimee died five years ago from a rare form of SCID, said her condition was undiagnosed until she reached the age of five. But by then it was too late and a bone marrow transplant failed to restore her immune system.Mrs Drew, of Stockport, Cheshire - a fundraiser for the Primary Immunodeficiency Association and Jeans for Genes - believes the new treatment could have saved her daughter's life.'This therapy is wonderful,' she said. 'But almost as important as gene therapy is diagnosing this condition. Too many children are dying without this being recognised.'"
telegraph,16/10/2007 00:01,news,"A pioneering technique to strengthen the crumbling joints of patients who need a second hip replacement could help thousands of people every year, scientists claim.         As many as 10,000 people a year need to have worn-out hip implants replaced, as life expectancy increases.         In a quarter of cases the new hip does not cement in easily, leaving patients unable to walk and vulnerable to becoming obese and suffering heart disease.         Now British scientists are to test a promising way to harvest a patient's stem cells in the hope it can boost the success rate of 'revision hip replacements'.         Prof Gordon Blunn and his team at the Institute of Orthopaedics, University College London, together with John Skinner, an orthopaedic surgeon at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore, Middlesex, received £130,000 from the UK Stem Cell Foundation and the Medical Research Council.         The grant is for preliminary experiments that will pave the way for a trial next year on 80 patients who need a hip replaced for a second time.         Prof Blunn believes that the quality of bone chips which are squeezed into damaged hip joints to rebuild them — before an artificial replacement hip is implanted — can be improved by first transplanting the patient's stem cells into them.         The cells would be removed from bone marrow and extracted from the patient's hip under anaesthetic.         Stem cells from the marrow are isolated, then grown in the laboratory in sterile conditions and used to seed new growth in the bone chips.         It is hoped this will create a more effective way to fix bone damage and inflammation caused by debris from the old artificial joint.         His preliminary experiments suggest bone formation can be boosted up to 75 per cent by the transplant of a patient's own stem cells – the building blocks used by the body during growth and repair.         Prof Blunn said it was unclear whether the NHS could cope with the demands of having to grow a patient's stem cells, estimating that the cost would be around £2,000 per patient if the method were used routinely.          The chief executive of the Medical Research Council, Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, said: 'The idea is to use autologous stem cells [taken from the patient themselves] to accelerate healing and outcome.'"
telegraph,9/8/2001 0:01,news,"A SLIDE towards the cloning of babies may occur in Europe because six countries out of 21 still lack legislation banning 'reproductive cloning', according to the European Science Foundation.In a policy paper, the foundation supports research on stem cells - which can be removed from a foetus, adult or embryo - because they show huge potential for growing a range of cells to repair a damaged body. But it also acknowledges unease and ethical concerns about cloning.The foundation backs the creation of stem cells by therapeutic cloning, though under tight regulatory control, and calls for a ban on the creation of babies by reproductive cloning, which relies on the same techniques.However the paper reports that Belgium, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland, Poland and Turkey do not outlaw reproductive cloning and urges all countries to introduce relevant stem cell legislation, and keep it under review, saying that 'without clear and enforceable legislation, there would be nothing to stop the slide to reproductive cloning'.Because therapeutic cloning requires human eggs, which are in short supply, some scientists are interested in using animal eggs. The foundation recommends that the creation of 'chimeras' be carried out for animals only when ethically justified, for instance for cloning endangered species.      The first application to dismantle human embryos and store their cells in a bank for the development of novel treatments has been submitted to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. The application from Dr Austin Smith of the Centre for Genome Research, Edinburgh University, is the first since an extension of research on human embryos, including limited cloning, was approved in January. Scientists hope to develop new treatments for a wide range of diseases based on human embryonic stem cells.   "
telegraph,23/01/2009 02:19,news,"A US biotech company is planning to start the world's first study of a treatment for spinal cord injuries based on human embryonic stem cells. The company gained federal permission this week to inject eight to 10 patients with cells derived from embryonic cells, said Dr. Thomas Okarma, president and CEO of Geron Corp. of Menlo Park, California.The patients will be paraplegics, who can use their arms but can't walk. They will receive a single injection within two weeks of their injury.The study is aimed at testing the safety of the procedure, but doctors will also look for signs of improvement like return of sensation or movement in the legs, Mr Okarma said.Whatever its outcome, the study will mark a new chapter in the contentious history of embryonic stem cell research in the United States - a field where debate spilled out of the laboratory long ago and into national politics.While some overseas doctors claim to use human embryonic stem cells in their clinics, stem cell experts said they knew of no previous human studies that use such cells.'It's a milestone and it's a breakthrough for the field' because Geron passed the safety hurdles for getting federal clearance to launch the study, said Ed Baetge, chief scientific officer of Novocell Inc. His company hopes to begin a similar human study for treating diabetes in a few years.In addition, said spinal cord injury researcher Dr. Wise Young of Rutgers University, 'a lot of hope of the spinal cord injury community is riding on this trial.'Embryonic stem cells can develop into any cell of the body, and scientists have long hoped to harness them for creating replacement tissues to treat a variety of diseases. But research has been controversial because embryos must be destroyed to obtain them.President Barack Obama has promised to relax the Bush administration's restrictions on federal financing for such research. But Mr Obama's ascent to the White House had nothing to do with the US Food and Drug Administration's granting permission for the new study, Mr Okarma said.In fact, the company says, the project involves stem cells that were eligible for federal funding under Bush, although no federal money was used to develop the experimental treatment or to pay for the human study.Other human cells, called adult stem cells, have been tested before in people to treat heart problems, for example.In the Geron study, the injections will be made in the spine at the site of damage. Animal studies suggest that once injected, the cells will mature and repair what is essentially a lack of insulation around damaged nerves, and also pump out substances that nerves need to function and grow.

telegraph,21/08/2007 00:01,news,"A vaccine to cut the risk of becoming overweight could be ready for testing within the next five years, according to research that suggests obesity can sometimes be catching.         A common virus may be one factor that contributes to the obesity epidemic sweeping the west, according to the research in the United States.         Although obesity is primarily linked to eating too many calories or burning too few, other factors may play a role, from lack of sleep to changes in stomach bacteria and now a common cold virus.         Scientists in Louisiana showed that infection with human adenovirus-36 (Ad-36), long known as a cause of colds and eye infections, transformed adult stem cells obtained from fat tissue into fat cells, whereas stem cells not exposed to the virus were unchanged.         The study was conducted at Pennington Biomedical Research Centre, Baton Rouge, by Dr Magdalena Pasarica, in a lab led by Dr Nikhil Dhurandhar.         In addition, the study reported a virus gene that appeared to be involved in this obesity-promoting effect.         The findings were presented yesterday by Dr Pasarica to the American Chemical Society in Boston.         Dr Dhurandhar told The Daily Telegraph that a vaccine aimed at this kind of 'infect-obesity' could be ready for tests within five or 10 years.         Dr Pasarica emphasised that 'not all infected people will develop obesity. We're not saying that a virus is the only cause of obesity, but this study provides stronger evidence that some obesity cases may involve viral infections.'         However, 'we first need to prove that Ad-36 causes human obesity'.         Although it would be unethical deliberately to infect people to cause obesity to show the link, evidence for it was growing. 'We would ultimately like to identify the underlying factors that predispose some obese people to develop obesity after infection with this virus and eventually find a way to treat it.'         An earlier study - the first to associate a virus with human obesity - found that 30 per cent of obese people were infected with the Ad-36 virus, against just 11 per cent of non obese individuals.         In the new study, Dr Pasarica and her associates obtained adult stem cells from fatty tissue from liposuction patients. Half the stem cells were exposed to the virus.         After about a week of growth in tissue culture, most of the virus-infected adult stem cells developed into fat cells, whereas the non-infected stem cells did not.         The exact mechanism by which the virus might cause obesity was unknown, said Dr Pasarica, who did not rule out the possibility that other human viruses may also contribute to obesity.         Researchers also do not know how long the virus remains in the body of obese individuals nor how long its fat-enhancing effect lasts once the virus is gone.         However, animals that developed the virus remained obese up to six months after their infection was gone.         Scientists are now trying to find out why some people with the virus develop obesity while others do not.         Tam Fry, board member of the National Obesity Forum and chairman of the Child Growth Foundation, said: 'You have to take this research seriously and it would be wrong to dismiss it as nonsense.         'But it would be absolutely absurd to assume that obesity is something you 'catch' and cannot be helped. The message is that if you eat more than you burn, you'll get fat.'"
telegraph,13/04/2013 07:00,technology,"After a historic three-way deal signed in Amsterdam this week, a ground-breaking Center for Stem Cell Research will be set up in Moscow in 2014 with collaboration between major Dutch and Russian universities. The University   Medical Centre Groningen in the Netherlands, the Russian   Vavilov Institute of General Genetics and Moscow’s Skolkovo   Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) have set up the first   Center for Research, Education and Innovation (CREI) to position both   countries as leaders in stem cell technology. There will be strong financial support for the CREI from the Russian   government to commercialise the considerable opportunities from biomedical   research. Fifteen of these five-year long research projects will be founded   by 2020 and possess a cumulative budget of $675 million. The US will also participate through a sub-contract to the Whitehead Institute   in Groningen in a global effort to accelerate the commercialisation of stem   cell science, which is one of the fastest developing and promising fields in   biomedicine. The 2012 Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery that mature cells can be   reprogrammed to become pluripotent (stem cells) by scientists in Japan and   the UK ,and Skoltech has engaged one of the world’s leading experts in   cancer and molecular genetics to oversee the project. . 'At Skoltech we are building a university from the ground up in a unique   way, dedicated to translating research to real impact in the commercial   world. We have convinced a world leader in the field to move to Moscow to   start the Center and we are really excited to have attracted him,' said   Edward Crawley, President of Skoltech. The Center will also bring to Moscow leading international researchers in the   field to conduct courses and training for industry, faculty and researchers.   Previously, these individuals would have had no other recourse but to search   for expertise outside of the country. The Skoltech Center for Stem Cell Research will focus on using stem cells to   address liver diseases, cancer, aging and current incurable diseases by   creating transplantable stem cells from induced pluripotent cells and   developing specific cellular systems. The Center will also work with many of   the 800 start-up companies that are based at the Skolkovo Park in Moscow to   create marketable products. Currently there is not a single Russian university in the world's Top 200   universities, and Skoltech is a major project to address this. The creation   of the Skolkovo campus at the Skolkovo Park in a partnership with Boston’s   MIT, and international deals of this nature are expected to push Russia into   this elite within five years. The academic tie-up with the Netherlands follows recent Russian commercial   partnerships with corporations such as Cisco, IBM, Siemens and Rosneft that   have all invested in Skolkovo. These blue-chip companies were recently   joined at the end of 2012 by Samsung who signed an agreement to set up a R&D   centre in Moscow. "
telegraph,13/02/2001 00:00,comment,"ALL over the world, therapists yesterday reported a wave of panic and depression as word spread that the human species has only 30,000 genes. People wept openly in the street, humiliated by the thought that we have only twice as many genes as flies and worms, and barely more than cress.Not since Copernicus demoted our planet to a satellite of the Sun, or Darwin demoted our species to a branch of the ape family, has there been such a pitiless reminder that there is nothing special about us. Hardly more complex than cress!If the quantity of our genes is humiliating, the quality does not seem to offer much reassurance. Scientists reported yesterday that about 60 per cent of our genes are direct copies of ones used by flies, worms, yeast and bacteria: themes invented by our common ancestors and used ever since. Once we know what mouse genes look like, the number of uniquely human genes will shrink even more.For instance, the 'hox' genes that are used for laying down the basic body plan of the human embryo are recognisably the same as those that flies use for the same purpose. They are so similar, in fact, that human hox genes can be substituted for fly hox genes to grow a normal fly.Likewise, and even more surprisingly, the 17 genes that we switch on every time we remember something are the same as the ones with which flies remember. It seems that we inherited both sets from our last common ancestor, a humble creature known as the 'roundish flatworm' that probably lived more than 600 million years ago.Nature, it transpires, is a careful economist. Once she has invented a new trick, she rarely discards it. In the most remarkable similarity of all, just one basic genetic code - the dictionary that translates DNA into protein - is good enough for all living things, a fact that reveals that all living things on the planet share a single common ancestor.It gets worse. It was announced yesterday that, of the genes that we vertebrates do not share with flies and yeast, one set - of 223 genes - has been borrowed directly from bacteria. It seems that our vertebrate ancestors somehow unwittingly had sex with bacteria and incorporated some of their genes into our own genome.This so-called horizontal transfer of genes between species was probably common among microbes in the early days of life on Earth, but nobody expected to find it going on in animals. It incidentally puts a spoke in the wheel of opponents of genetic modification, who have made much of the unnaturalness of breaching the 'species barrier'. If nature does not respect the species barrier, why should Monsanto?Ready for still more humiliation? The 98 per cent of the genome that does not consist of genes at all is largely borrowed from viruses and still simpler types of digital parasite called transposons.The human symphony, in other words, consists almost entirely of old tunes stolen from other works. Unique we are, but not made from unique parts. In any case, uniqueness is a commodity in oversupply in the natural world: every species is unique.A moment's reflection, however, dispels the humiliation. If the media can find a single human being whose perception of the human condition has been genuinely upset by the news facetiously recited above, then I will eat my hat. Thirty thousand is still a large number: there are more human genes than there are species of mammal, bird, reptile and amphibian put together. But our self-esteem did not rest on an expectation that we had 100,000 genes, but on 10,000 years of learning and achievement - on the accomplishments of Socrates, Leonardo, Shakespeare and Einstein.In the past few days, some commentators have made heroic attempts to discover the opposite message - that the paucity of human genes rescues human exceptionalism. So few genes cannot determine our behaviour. Instead, goes the argument, the environment must determine behaviour and - phew! - free will exists.This is a non sequitur. If animals with fewer genes have more free will than animals with more genes, the flies and bacteria are more free than we are. Besides, environmental determinism is no less determinist than genetic determinism.Free will lies not in being at the mercy of our environments, but in the fact that our environments and many of our genes are also at the mercy of our behaviour. The learning and behaviour genes that we share with flies, for example, are activated by other actions in the living brain. They are puppets, not string-pullers.The search for what makes a human being human will go on, but it now seems unlikely that the raw sequence of the genome will reveal it. To be sure, the genome of the chimpanzee (which we know to be about 98.5 per cent the same as ours) will probably reveal some key differences that shed light on how we come to look different from our closest relative. But these might tell us very little about the interesting bits - language, for instance, or self-awareness.Once the genome of a dog has been read - and last week a company announced that it was interested in doing the dog genome next - the genetics behind the behavioural differences between different breeds of dog will be easy to identify. Breeding proves that genes account for the aggressiveness of a rottweiler, the docility of a spaniel or the herding instinct of a collie. By identifying those genes, we can go in search of their human equivalents, and they might provide a way into understanding the human brain.But yesterday's results suggest that both these projects might prove disappointing. The digital data of the genome itself might not be sufficiently revealing. The key to understanding our recipe will then have to wait for the result of a further scientific marathon, called the proteome. For, in one respect, we are much more sophisticated than flies. We do a lot more 'alternative splicing' than flies do: this means taking different sections of different genes and recombining them in several ways.Thus from our 30,000 genes we probably manufacture maybe 300,000 different proteins. Until alternative splicing is understood, the uniqueness of the human being will probably remain as mysterious as ever."

When Sonya Smith, a 45-year-old mother of three from Brisbane, arrived in New Delhi for the treatment two months ago she was confined to a wheelchair and unable to control the most basic bodily functions.         After eight weeks of injections from Dr Geeta Shroff - a controversial pioneer of embryonic stem-cell research - Mrs Smith says she is able to stand with the aid of callipers and has regained bowel and bladder control.         She also reports recovering 'deep sensation' in her thighs and feet and has been able to swing her legs. 'When I first moved my toes, I was blown away,' Mrs Smith told Sky News.         The treatment has given fresh hope to Mrs Smith whose 'T11' and 'T12' bones in her spine were broken when she was crushed by her car as she tried to stop it rolling down a hill after a handbrake failure.         'The doctors in Australia told me I would never walk again,' she said. 'Now I actually think I will be able to walk again - without callipers some day.'         Mrs Smith is one of more than 300 patients who have been treated by Dr Shroff at her 20-bed clinic in a suburb of New Delhi, with many making similarly dramatic claims for the injections which can cost up to £20,000 for a full course.         'The patients who come to me have often given up hope,' Dr Shroff, 43, said last night. 'But by transplanting these embryonic stem cells into the patient we start to see signs of regeneration and improvement.         'Mrs Smith has not had a 'miracle', but she no longer has to suffer the indignity of catheterisation and wearing diapers.'         Dr Shroff, who is self-funded and has never submitted her work to peer review, said she discovered her techniques while developing a technique to determine the sex of unborn babies with ultrasound scans.          'I started my basic research in 2000 and have been treating patients since 2002 by injecting the stem cells into the site of the injury. We have had many successes like Mrs Smith's in the past five years,' she said.          Although Dr Shroff refuses to reveal the secrets of her techniques - she is applying for a worldwide patent - she claims to have built an 'inexhaustible' bank of stem cells from a single embryo which she uses to treat patients suffering from a range of conditions including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease.         In 2005 when the first stories of Dr Shroff's success were made public, several leading stem cell experts described her treatments - which have not been tested on animals or been independently evaluated - as irresponsible and unethical.          Others attributed patients' improvement to the 'placebo' effect. However, Mrs Smith does not agree. 'It is definitely the stem cells,' she added. 'I can feel my thighs where before I couldn't.'          Asked why she had not submitted her techniques to international scrutiny, Dr Shroff said she was protecting her commercial property and had decided to allow the results to speak for themselves.         'I did try to present my work at two conferences in the early stages, but it was rejected. I therefore decided to be judged on the results of my work which anyone is free to inspect. I have no absolutely no objections to any doctor coming to review my patients, they can see the files, record the scans beforehand and observe the effects of my treatment.'          Dr Stephen Minger, a leading stem cell scientist at King's College London, said: 'I think it's dubious to say the least. She might be Mother Teresa, but I'm sceptical.'"
telegraph,2/6/2013 7:40,news,"An injectable gel containing magnetic stem cells could be used to repair broken bones and damaged cartilage.In Harry Potter it took a wave of a wand and an incantation, but now doctors   could soon be able to regrow patients bones for real with the help of some   magnets.Scientists have developed an injectable gel containing stem cells that could   be used to repair broken bones and damaged cartilage.They have found that they can recreate the conditions that cause new cartilage   and bone to develop in babies by attaching tiny magnetic particles to the   surface of the stem cells.When a magnetic bandage is wrapped around the injured site, these particles   react, simulating the effect of exercise that encourages bone to grow denser.The scientists behind the research have already used the technique to repair   injured bones in mice and chickens, but they are preparing to start   pre-clinical trials in humans later this year.Professor Alicia El Haj, director of the institute for science and technology   in medicine at Keele University, said: “We are replicating the body’s   development to allow us to mend broken bones or treat orthopaedic injuries.“You normally have cartilage that develops first to form a kind of template   that the bone grows around. Then the more you exercise the denser your bones   become.“Patients with an injury are not going to be walking around and putting weight   on their bones so they have problems building up dense bone. “If they inject a solution containing stem cells into their injury and then   strap on a magnetic bandage, this could do the work for them while they are   still too injured to get out of bed.”Working with scientists at Southampton University and Northampton University,   Professor El Haj and her team have been developing the new technique to   allow patients to receive a simple injection to help repair injuries.Stem cells could be taken from the patient’s own body - the potential sources   include skin cells - then suspended in a liquid gel that solidifies as it   changes temperature once inside the body. This solid gel creates a new scaffold for the stem cells to grow on.   Biological signals called growth factors in the gel also help guide cells to   develop into cartilage.The researchers have also developed magnetic nanoparticles that they can   attach to channels on the outer surface of the stem cells. Normally these channels open in response to the strain caused by exercise and   encourage the cells to grow – an essential process to help bones grow thick   and strong. By attaching the magnetic particles and applying a magnetic field, the   scientists found they could replicate this.It means that they can simulate the effect of exercise on the developing bone   without the patient needing to leave their bed.Professor El Haj said the team hoped to begin trails in humans within the next   five years.She said: “The concept is that we have all the components that play a role in   normal developmental processes in the body and we are creating them in the   gel.“By making it injectable, we could move this into a primary care situation   where people could have an injection in the GPs surgery and then they are   given a magnetic bandage to take home and wear.”"
dailymail,16/07/2015 16:10,sciencetech,"Artificial sperm with enough male genes to successfully fertilise eggs has been mass produced for the first time.Scientists in China used the sperm, which does not have a tail and cannot swim, to produce what they call 'half-cloned' mice.They say the technique could help speed up research on diseases, such as cancer, by producing large numbers of genetically modified animals.However, they added it is still too early for the sperm to be used in humans as it still leads to 80 per cent of the offspring dying.Professor Li Jinson, lead scientist on the project at the Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told the South China Morning Post: 'Our man-made sperm cells can be used to generate an army of half-cloned mice with ease and efficiency.'These half-cloned mice will fight on the frontline in battles against cancer and other genetic health issues.'A 20 per cent rate for healthy breeds may be good enough for experimental animals, but not humans.'If it is applied to human sperm it could lead to an 80 per cent death rate or defects at birth.'While man-made sperm has been produced previously by scientists around the world they were previously grown from  stem cells.This method is controversial because it uses cells taken directly from embryos.  Professor Li and his colleagues, whose research is published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, have been developing a technique that does not require the destruction of embryos.In 2012 they announced they had placed a sperm into an empty egg, which had had its nucleus and genetic material removed.This turned into an embryonic-like stem cell with functions similar to sperm but without a tail or the ability to swim. These could be used to grow large numbers of these artificial cells.However, the technique was highly inefficient and eggs fertilised by these artificial sperm cells would only lead to healthy animals around two per cent of the time.In their latest research, the scientists used a gene editing technique known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter some of the genes within the artificial sperm.By turning off two genes – H19 and Gtl2 – thought to play a role in embryonic development, they found they could increase the efficiency of the process.Put simply, they remove the nucleus from an egg, inject the head of a sperm into it and grow it into stem cells, then inject these cells into a healthy egg And around 20 per cent of the offspring produced using this tweaked artificial sperm survive.However, they cautioned they are still to investigate whether the editing would have an impact on future generations of animals.Professor Li also said any attempts to use the technique in humans would produce an 'ethical crisis'. Instead they claim the technique could provide a way to produce genetically modified animals for studying disease in a laboratory.Writing in Cell Stem Cell, the researchers said: 'We hope that the method we have developed will facilitate genetic analysis of development and modelling of diseases in mice.'"
telegraph,18/06/2008 18:09,news,"Biological alchemy has been used to convert one cell type into another kind that could be used to repair a body damaged by accident or disease, marking a new approach to regenerative medicine that does away with the use of stem cells and embryos.                                                      Stem cell research revolution spells end for therapeutic cloning                                                                         Embryo-free stem cell research gets boost                                                                        Scientists uncover secret of eternal youth                                             In the quest for new treatments, scientists have spent the last decade working on human embryonic stem cells, parent cells which have the potential to turn into any of the 200 plus types in the body, for a vast range of treatments, from heart disease to Parkinson's disease.         Rather than use embryos, or obtain embryonic stem cells by the use of cloning or genetic modification, a new front has opened up in regenerative medicine: the direct conversion of one cell type, say a skin cell, into another, say a brain cell.         Today, New Scientist reports new evidence that this approach should work based on research that, according to Dolly pioneer Sir Ian Wilmut of Edinburgh University, 'should make us all reconsider our general strategy.'         Sir Ian said that pioneering work in Oxford University by Prof Tariq Enver showed it is possible, turning white blood cells into red cells, but now a new study by Prof Doug Melton of Harvard University 'is a timely reminder' that this method is worth more study to find out the best way to create new cells and tissues for repair.         Prof Melton told the annual meeting of the International Society for Stem Cell Research in Philadelphia how he took specialist 'pancreatic exocrine cells' that secrete digestive enzymes, which make up to 95 per cent of the pancreas, and converted them directly into another cell type, called beta cells, which make the hormone insulin to control blood sugar levels.         Although there is a long way to go to show that this could be used to help treat diabetes, it adds to the existing evidence that a cell's destiny is no longer fixed.         The team achieved the feat by hunting for special genes that control how the genetic code is interpreted by cells to turn them into brain, bone, heart cells or whatever. They found nine of these so called transcription factor genes that seemed critical for beta cell development.         Then Prof Melton's team used a standard method of genetic modification, where a virus is used to introduced a gene.         They injected nine viruses, each carrying a different gene, into the pancreases of lab mice and found that some of the pancreatic exocrine cells seemed to turn into fully functional beta cells and started to make insulin.         'If we look at every gene we know to be important for beta cell function, we find it turned on,' Prof Melton tells New Scientist, adding that they have now managed to repeat the feat using only three genes.         Scientists are wary about using viruses to genetically alter cells in the body because they are unable to control how new genes are introduced with enough precision to ensure there are no side effects, notably cancer. But the hope is that, in years to come, a cocktail of factors could reprogram one cell type, say a skin cell, to become another.         Prof Melton's work offers another alternative to one now being pursued by Sir Ian and many other scientists: using genetic engineering, Prof Shinya Yamanaka at Kyoto University found a way to create human embryo stem cells without the need for human eggs, which are in short supply, and without the need to create and destroy human cloned embryos, which is bitterly opposed by the pro life movement.         'Many more observations are needed, some with human cells, to confirm that the cells are able to function normally and to discover whether the Yamanaka or the Melton approaches are most effective,' says Sir Ian."
telegraph,14/06/2007 00:01,finance,"BP has signed a development deal with Craig Venter, the American who cracked the human genome in 2000.         Synthetic Genomics, a US company run by Dr Venter, recently submitted worldwide patents on methods it has developed to create synthetic microbes to create greener kinds of biofuel.         The methods and techniques are used to make a bacterium - nicknamed Mycoplasma laboratorium - from laboratory-made DNA as part of an effort to create designer bugs to manufacture hydrogen and biofuels, as well as absorb carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse gases.         The deal focuses on developing biological conversion processes for gas and oil that could lead to cleaner energy production and improved recovery rates. As part of the agreement, BP has also made an equity investment in Synthetic Genomics, which is close to creating the first synthetic genetic codes, or genomes.         In the first phase of the BP/Synthetic Genomics program, the research will focus on gaining a better understanding of microbial communities in various hydrocarbon formations such as oil, natural gas, coal and shale.         Synthetic Genomics will use its expertise in reading the genetic codes of organisms, and growing them in the lab, to produce the first comprehensive study of the genetic make-up of microbial populations living in these environments.         Once the basic science research phases are complete, BP and Synthetic Genomics will seek jointly to commercialise any discoveries, which could include underground bugs that are able to make fuel in an environmentally-friendly way.         'We believe that one of the most promising solutions to producing cleaner fuels will be found through genomic-driven advances,' said Dr Venter.         'Through our research collaboration with BP, we will achieve a new and better understanding of the subsurface hydrocarbon bioconversion process which we are confident will yield substantial cleaner energy sources.'"
telegraph,6/11/2008 16:10,news,"Brain tissue has been made from embryonic stem cells for the first time, providing hope for future treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer’s.Stem cells taken from human embryos were used to form tissues of the cerebral   cortex, the supreme control tower of the brain which is involved in thinking   and motion, Research on stem cells is seen as having the potential to save lives by   helping to find cures for diseases such as cancer and diabetes or to replace   damaged cells, tissues and organs. This is the first time that brain cells have been made which could lead to   treatments for stroke victims as well as progressive brain diseases such as   Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. The process was successfully carried out by Yoshiki Sasai and Mototsugu   Eiraku, of the Riken Centre for Developmental Biology in Kobe. The cortex remained undeveloped, equivalent to that of a foetus, but it’s the   first time that researchers have ever created brain tissue involving   different cell types, rather than single brain cells. The researchers placed about 3,000 embryonic stem cells in a culture solution,   and had the cells gather together naturally to form a solid, and, after 46   days, a sphere of tissue measuring two millimeters in diameter was formed. The tissues self-organised into four distinct zones very similar to the   structure seen in human foetuses, and conducted neuro-activity such as   transmitting electrical signals, the institute said. “In regenerative therapy, only a limited number of diseases can be cured with   simple cell transplants,” a statement from the institiute said. “Transplanting tissues could raise hopes for greater functional recovery.   Cultivated tissues are still insufficient and too small to be used to treat   stroke patients. “But study of in-vitro cultivation of more mature cortex tissues, such as   those with six zones like in the adult human brain, will be stepped up.”The tissues could also serve as “a mini organ” for use in studying the cause   of the Alzheimer’s disease and developing vaccines, it said. Embryonic stem cells are harvested by destroying a viable embryo, a process   that some people find unacceptable. Riken said cortex tissues were also obtained from “induced pluripotent stem   cells,” which are similar to embryonic stem cells but artificially induced,   typically from adult cells such as skin cells. Findings from the research were published in the journal “Cell Stem Cell”. "
telegraph,21/12/2000 00:00,news,"BRITAIN'S leading expert in stem cells said yesterday he would be among the first scientists to apply for a licence to use human embryos in the search for new treatments for disease.Dr Austin Smith, director of the human genome centre at Edinburgh University, outlined his plans after MPs voted in favour of relaxing the rules governing embryo experiments. The vote, which needs to be approved by the House of Lords, opens the door to a limited form of human cloning and the use of embryonic stem cells as a source of spare body tissue for transplants.Embryonic stem cells are found in newly conceived embryos and have the ability to turn into any type of tissue in the body. Doctors believe they could one day be used to treat a range of diseases such as cancer, Parkinson's and diabetes in children.Dr Smith's laboratory already has a licence to use embryos, donated by women undergoing IVF, for research into infertility. He welcomed the House of Commons vote, saying: 'This is a very important result, not just for the UK but for the whole of science because it puts embryonic stem cell research in the public domain.'The first targets for the new research are likely to be Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, juvenile diabetes and heart disease, he said. 'It is far too early for embryo cloning. At the right time, in a few years, laboratories may apply for licences to do that, but not yet,' he said.Under the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, scientists can use human embryos up to 14 days old for licensed research into fertility, contraception, miscarriages, congenital diseases and chromosome abnormalities.But the law did not permit the use of embryos for research into diseases. Pressure to extend the criteria came after two scientific breakthroughs: the cloning of Dolly the sheep and research into embryonic stem cells.The British Medical Association, the Wellcome Trust, the Parkinson's Disease Society, the British Heart Foundation and the Leukaemia Research Fund support the move."
telegraph,12/2/2012 7:20,news,"British scientists are claiming to have made a major breakthrough after creating brain tissue from human skin. The researchers have for the first time generated crucial types of human brain   cells in the laboratory by reprogramming skin cells, which they say could   speed up the hunt for new treatments for conditions such as Alzheimer's   disease, epilepsy and stroke.Until now it has only been possible to generate tissue from the cerebral   cortex, the area of the brain where most major neurological diseases occur,   by using controversial embryonic stem cells, obtained by the destruction of   an embryo.This has meant the supply of brain tissue available for research has been   limited due to the ethical concerns around embryonic stem cells and   shortages in their availability.Scientists at the University   of Cambridge, however, now insist they have overcome this problem after   showing for the first time that it is possible to re-programme   adult human skin cells so that they develop into neurons found in the   cerebral cortex.Initially brain cells grown in this way could be used to help researchers gain   a better understanding of how the brain develops, what goes wrong when it is   affected by disease and it could also be used for screening new drug   treatments.Eventually they hope the cells could also be used to provide healthy tissue   that can be implanted into patients to treat neurodegenerative diseases and   brain damage.Dr Rick Livesey, who led the research at the University of Cambridge's Gurdon   [corr] Institute, said: 'The cerebral cortex makes up 75% of the human   brain, is where all the important processes that make us human take place.   It is, however, also the major place where disease can occur.'We have been able to take reprogrammed skin cells so they develop into   brain stem cells and then essentially replay brain development in the   laboratory. 'We can study brain development and what goes wrong when it is affected   by disease in a way we haven't been able to before. We see it as a major   breakthrough in what will now be possible.'The cerebral cortex is the part of the brain that is responsible for most of   the major high-level thought processes such as memory, language and   consciousness.While human brain cells have been created from stem cells before, this has   relied upon embryonic stem cells. Attempts to make them from skin cells have   produced neurons that are not found in the cerebral cortex.Dr Livesey and his colleagues were able to create the two major types of   neuron that form the cerebral cortex from reprogrammed skin cells and show   that they were identical to those created from the more controversial   embryonic stem cells.Dr Livesey, whose findings are published in the journal Nature Neuroscience,   said this may eventually lead to new treatments for patients where damaged   tissue could be replaced by brain cells grown in the laboratory from a   sample of their skin.He said: 'You don't need to rebuild damage to recover function as the   brain is quite good at recovering itself – it does this after stroke for   example. However, it may be possible to give it some extra real estate that   it can use to do this. 'We can make large numbers of cerebral cortex neurons by taking a sample   of skin from anybody, so in principal it should be possible to put these   back into the patients.'Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, which funded the   study alongside the Wellcome Trust, added: 'Turning stem cells into   networks of fully functional nerve cells in the lab holds great promise for   unravelling complex brain diseases such as Alzheimer's.'"
telegraph,6/12/2011 17:00,news,"British scientists have created the first known batch of 'gold standard' stem cells which could one day lead to a new wave of treatments for degenerative diseases. The stem cells, taken from human embryos and grown in the lab, are of   unprecedented quality and could be offered to researchers before the end of   next year for eventual use in clinical trials. Previous embryonic stem cell (ESC) trials in humans have used lower-quality 'research   grade' cells, which are manipulated and reclassified into 'clinical   grade'. But the new ESCs, described as the 'Holy Grail for regenerative medicine',   are of clinical quality from the moment they are donated by patients and do   not require a costly and risky conversion. They are also untainted by animal-derived products which have been used by   other researchers to stimulate growth. Two lines of stem cells, which can be converted into virtually any type of   tissue in the body, have been donated to the UK Stem Cell Bank (UKSCB) by   researchers from King's College London. Prof Peter Braude, a leading member of the team, said: 'The key here is   that these are clinical grade lines, they have been set up from the   beginning as lines that do not contain animal products and have not got   animal products coming into contact with them.' While ESCs of similar quality could potentially have been cultured in secret   by private researchers such as drug companies, these are the first of their   kind to be developed for public health benefit. A line of cells of a similar quality is being developed by Manchester   University researchers and is expected to be donated to the stem cell bank   next month. At the UKSCB the cell lines will undergo rigorous testing to ensure they are   safe and of a sufficient calibre for use in human trials, but it is hoped   they will be a 'seedstock' for future experiments. Prof Braude said the achievement, recorded in the Cytotherapy journal, marked   ten years of painstaking research. He said: 'Cells that are ready for clinical use have really been the Holy   Grail of everybody in terms of regenerative medicine.  'There is still a long way to go ... these are not ready for use now.   They get handed over to the stem cell bank and they do exhaustive testing   and a lot of lines are going to fail.' The cells could be handed over to university scientists or private companies   by the end of next year, though there would likely be a significant period   of preparation by researchers before clinical trials actually began. Dr Glyn Stacey, director of the UKSCB, said: 'They will be released – I   wouldn't like to put a date on it, but some time next year.  'The moment we release them they are ready for use in a clinical trial.' It is widely believed that ESCs could one day be used to generate healthy   tissue to replace damaged cells throughout the body, and potentially form   the basis of new treatments for conditions like heart disease and   Parkinson's. ESCs are taken from frozen embryos the size of a pinhead, which are donated to   researchers by IVF patients who have no further use for them and would   otherwise have been discarded. "

An attempt could be made by the team in Newcastle upon Tyne as early as next week, placing the country at the forefront of worldwide efforts to create a revolutionary generation of medical treatments.          Scientists such as Dr Ian Wilmut, who cloned Dolly the sheep, welcomed the news as the first step in an effort to provide new insights into illness and ways to grow a patient's own cells to treat a vast range of diseases, from Alzheimer's to Parkinson's.          But the decision was condemned by pro-life campaigners as tragic and frightening. It marked the manipulation, exploitation and trivialisation of human life, they said.          The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority gave the Newcastle team permission to study how to clone early human embryos efficiently and use them as a source of stem cells with the potential to develop into any type for medical treatments and to understand disease.          The authority emphasised: 'Stem cells created under this licence will be used for research only.'          It is the first time such work has been approved in Europe.          Prof Alison Murdoch, one of the team, said she was 'thrilled' and added: 'There is no reason why we can't do it next week.'          When the application was submitted in February by Prof Murdoch, of the Newcastle NHS Fertility Centre, and Dr Miodrag Stojkovic, of Newcastle University, the aim was to develop a treatment for diabetes and to reach the point where a Type 1 diabetic's tissue could be grown for transplant.          But the image of therapeutic cloning as a potential cure-all received a dent when it emerged that the overall aim of the original application was questioned by a committee of the Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.          Because it raised legal issues that could be seized upon by pro-life campaigners, the team at Newcastle's Centre for Life has dropped this aim for the time being.          Dr Denise Faustman, a researcher in diabetes at Harvard Medical School, said a 'paradigm shift' in diabetes research had occurred that placed more emphasis on alternative approaches.          Pro-life groups, such as Comment on Reproductive Ethics (Core), say that stem cells created from a cloned embryo of a diabetic may suffer the same disorder.          They cite evidence from studies of mice that the stem cells may proliferate out of control and provoke immune reactions.          Core said it was taking legal advice on the legality of the cloning licence. Josephine Quintavalle, a spokesman, also questioned whether there was a conflict of interest in the role of Prof Murdoch as head of the fertility unit that provides eggs for cloning and her role in submitting the application to use the eggs.          Prof Murdoch said: 'We have had overwhelming support from senior scientists and clinicians from all over the world and many letters from patients who may benefit from the research.          'Realistically, we have at least five years of further laboratory work to do before we move to clinical trials but this could be reduced if we receive additional funding.'          Dr Stojkovic, said he was surprised and pleased that the licence had been granted.          He said: 'Newcastle is now the national front-runner in this area of research but pressure is mounting in America for its scientists to be allowed to do this work.          If we are to stay at the cutting edge, we must obtain further financial backing or, as has happened before, Britain will lose out.'          The decision means that the Newcastle team could become only the second in the world to carry out human cloning successfully.          This year scientists in South Korea said they had produced the first human cloned embryos, although some scientists have said the work is not definitive.          Suzi Leather, the chairman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, said: 'After careful consideration of all the scientific, ethical, legal and medical aspects of the project, the licence committee agreed to grant an initial one-year research licence to the Newcastle Centre for Life.          'In Britain, research on human embryos is permitted only for certain purposes.          The purpose of this research is to increase knowledge about the development of embryos and enable this knowledge to be applied in developing treatments for serious disease.

dailymail,9/6/2015 22:00,wires,"By Alexandra Harney and Ben HirschlerSHANGHAI/LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - Years of pouring moneyinto its laboratories, wooing scientists home from overseas andurging researchers to publish and patent is starting to giveChina a competitive edge in biotechnology, a strategic field itsees as ripe for 'indigenous innovation.'The vast resources China can throw at research anddevelopment - overall funding more than quadrupled to $191billion in 2005-13 and the Thousand Talents Program hasrepatriated scientists - allow China to jumpquickly on promising new technologies, often first developedelsewhere.These efforts were illustrated vividly in April - notwithout controversy - when scientists at Sun Yat-sen Universityin Guangzhou published results of a ground-breaking experimentto alter the DNA of human embryos using new CRISPR-Cas9 geneediting technology.CRISPR, which allows scientists to edit virtually any genethey target, is akin to a biological word-processing programthat finds and replaces genetic defects.The Guangzhou team is not alone. Data compiled by ThomsonInnovation, a Thomson Reuters unit, shows China is a growingforce in gene editing, with a burgeoning patent portfolio.More than 50 Chinese institutions are patenting in thefield, led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, universities, theAnhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Beijing JifulinBiotech. Nearly a fifth of the 518 families of gene editingpatents analysed since 2004 were associated with Chineseentities.For top-tier institutions, 'the level of available resourcesis incredible in terms of the freedom, the flexibility thatgives key leading Chinese scientists to move very, very fast ona given research track if a new opportunity arises,' said JamesWilsdon, professor of science and democracy at the University ofSussex.PUSHING BOUNDARIESChina has also invested in gene sequencing.Shenzhen-based BGI, formerly the Beijing Genomics Institute,for example, claims to be the world's largest genomicsorganization, though the original gene sequencing technology wasdeveloped in the United States and Britain.China was also first to approve a gene therapy to treat headand neck cancer in 2003, though it remains controversial abroad,and Chinese scientists have pushed the boundaries in animalresearch.A team from Northwest A&F University and the National BeefCattle Improvement Centre reported last month that they haddeveloped genetically modified cows rich in the beneficialOmega-3 fatty acids more usually found in fish. Also, Chineseresearchers last year engineered the first monkeys with targetedmutations using the CRISPR gene editing system.'The Chinese could, over time, play a very significant rolein this game as they have a very entrepreneurial attitude - muchmore so than in parts of Europe,' said Rodger Novak, CEO ofCRISPR Therapeutics, a private Swiss-American biotech business.EASE OF USEOne of the attractions of CRISPR, which has the potential toeliminate certain diseases but also create designer babies, isits ease of use.'CRISPR technology is very simple. That's the beauty of it.It has taken off rapidly in the academic environment because itworks, it's reliable, it's cheap and you don't need a lot ofknowledge to make use of it,' said Novak.The technique has taken biology by storm, igniting a fiercepatent battle. Some in the field believe CRISPR could prove asrevolutionary, and as profitable, as recombinant DNA technology,which was developed in the 1970s and 80s, and launched thebiotechnology industry.But CRISPR has also been controversial.The paper by the Chinese team, led by Huang Junjiu, provokedan outcry from some U.S. and European scientists because it wasthe first to use human embryos.Professor Wilsdon said there is 'a tendency to considerChina at times like a Wild East frontier' where ethical concernsare given less weight, but he noted 'there are intense debateswithin the Chinese system about bioethics.'Robin Lovell-Badge, Head of Developmental Genetics atBritain's National Institute for Medical Research, does notbelieve the Chinese have a permanent edge in gene editing.'It's been so obvious that these techniques will be used inhuman embryos at some point. I don't think there's anyintellectual advantage. They've just done it first, and not verywell,' he said.Guoji Guo, a beneficiary of the returnee scheme and aprofessor at Zhejiang University using CRISPR on stem cells,said Huang's work was significant, but still relied on a tooldeveloped in the United States.'We want findings that can change the world,' Guo said.

Since the technique was first used in 1996 tocreate the cloned sheep Dolly, the United Nations has urgedcountries to ban it on ethical and moral grounds.In 2013, Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health and ScienceUniversity was the first to succeed using the method to makehuman embryonic stem cells from a patient's skin cells. Thecells are prized because they are 'pluripotent,' meaning theyhave the ability to transform into any type of cell in the body.In his latest study, Mitalipov and colleagues used themethod to make replacement cells for patients with mutations inmitochondrial genes, which are critical for producing energy incells. Mitochondrial genes have evaded scientists' efforts tocorrect such mutations, Mitalipov said.For the study, the team removed the nucleus of patients'cells and implanted them into unfertilized human eggs in whichthe mitochondria remained, but the rest of the DNA was removed.They then coaxed the eggs into dividing, producing embryonicstem cells which could be used to make healthy heart or nervestem cells to replace the patient's diseased cells.The researchers also showed that they could produce healthyembryonic-like stem cells using another method in which theyreprogram adult skin cells through the introduction of severalgenes, a method that does not involve the use of eggs.Lanza said several clinical trials are underway globallytesting pluripotent stem cell-derived therapies in humans,including treatments for diabetes, and eye and heart disease.The work was funded by the Leducq Foundation, a privateFrench foundation.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Andrew Hay)"
telegraph,9/11/2006 0:01,news,"Cell transplants to restore the sight of blind people could start within a decade, according to researchers who have successfully implanted light-sensitive cells into mice.          The first successful transplantation of photoreceptors — the nerve cells which line the back of the eye —marks a major advance in efforts to repair the central nervous system.          The research, funded by the Medical Research Council, could have a significant impact on many currently untreatable eye conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. Photoreceptor loss accounts for more blindness in the developed world than all other eye diseases combined.          The successful treatment of blind mice comes in the wake of many attempts to repair a damaged retina, notably by the use of stem cells, immature cells capable of developing into other types.          The retina was thought to be ideal to try out stem cell therapy because photoreceptor loss initially leaves the 'wiring' to the brain intact — transplanted photoreceptors need only make one tiny connection to restore sight.          Brain and retina stem cells, which have the ability to develop into different neural cells, were thought to have the best chance of becoming new photoreceptors. However, until now, transplants had failed.          The team from UCL Institutes of Ophthalmology and Child Health, University of Michigan, and Dr Robert MacLaren, an eye surgeon from Moorfields Eye Hospital, decided to see if more mature cells would be better. These were removed from the retinas of immature mice, the equivalent of the second trimester of a human pregnancy.          They transplanted photoreceptors into mice which were blind due to a genetic defect, similar to a human disease known as retinitis pigmentosa.          The team, led by Prof Robin Ali and Dr Jane Sowden, showed that developing retinal cells can integrate into the degenerating retina.          Light was shone into the eye of the transplanted mice. 'The pupils constrict to light after transplantation,' said Dr MacLaren.          'This is a very robust test of vision because the pupil constriction means that all the connections going out of the eye are getting to the brain, being processed and then the brain is responding by sending signals back into the orbit to drive the pupil. In other words, the mouse is seeing.          'We are now confident that this is the avenue to pursue to uncover ways of restoring vision to thousands who have lost their sight. We will be pursuing the idea of using the stem cell-like retinal cells particularly as these might in future be harvested from the affected patient, thus avoiding rejection.'          He estimated transplants could start in a decade but said that the team needs to know how to harvest cone photoreceptor cells, notably the red and green sensitive ones used for detailed daytime imaging.          'The transplantable cell is at a critical stage of development and generating enough of these cells for the fine vision a patient will need will be a major challenge,' he said.          The work, published in today's Nature magazine, is all the more remarkable because many scientists have thought that embryonic stem cells, the most flexible of all, are the key to success. Today's study shows timing is everything — it is better to use a more mature stem cell.          Prof Ali said: 'A population of cells can be found on the margin of the adult retina which have stem cell-like properties, in other words they are capable of self-renewal. These could be harvested through minor surgery and grown in the lab to become photoreceptor precursors before being re-implanted on the retina.' Prof Anand Swaroop, a co-author of the report, said: 'Perhaps within the next five years we will begin to see the first steps toward retinal cell transplants for people with blinding eye disease.'          Barbara McLaughlan, of the Royal National Institute of the Blind, said: 'This is exciting news but it is important not to raise the hopes of people who have lost their sight until the results of human trials become available.'                      rhighfield@telegraph.co.uk         "
dailymail,21/04/2015 10:46,health,"Common creams used to treat athlete's foot and eczema could undo the damage of multiple sclerosis, scientists claim.The surprise discovery could pave the way to ground-breaking new therapies for the devastating auto-immune disease ,which affects around 2.5 million worldwide.Scientists found that the anti-fungal agent miconazole and the steroid clobetasol both restored movement to mice paralysed by a rodent version of multiple sclerosis (MS). In laboratory tests, they prompted inactive mouse and human stem cells to regenerate myelin, the protective insulation-like coating around nerve fibres that is destroyed by the disease. Dr Robert Miller, of the US team from Case Western Reserve University who carried out the study, said the results marked a significant breakthrough.He said: 'It was a striking reversal of disease severity in the mice.'The drugs that we identified are able to enhance the regenerative capacity of stem cells in the adult nervous system.'This truly represents a paradigm shift in how we think about restoring function to multiple sclerosis patients.'Miconzanole is sold over the counter in most pharmacies as a cream to treat athlete's foot, while clobetasol cream is commonly prescribed to treat eczema. Although both drugs are widely used, a way must be found to use them safely as internal human treatments rather than creams or ointments before clinical trials can be considered.The researchers are confident this problem can be solved, but have warned patients not to jump the gun by using the drugs prematurely.Lead scientist Professor Paul Tesar, from Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, said: 'We appreciate that some patients or their families feel they cannot wait for the development of specific approved medications, but off-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms.'We are working tirelessly to ready a safe and effective drug for clinical use.'MS occurs when the immune system attacks myelin, thereby disrupting the passage of nerve signals.As the disease progresses, it produces symptoms ranging from mild numbness or tingling to full blown paralysis. Occasionally, it can prove fatal.Although current treatments can slow progression of MS and reduce its symptoms, the disease remains incurable.One new approach is to focus on special stem cells called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) that mature into myelin-producing cells.While other scientists have looked at ways of replacing lost stem cells using transplantation techniques, the Case Western team set out to find a way of stimulating existing, but inactive, OPCs.After screening 727 potential drug candidates, they identified two - miconazole and clobetasol - that coaxed the OPCs to form oligodendrocytes and repair nerve fibres stripped of myelin.'We know that there are stem cells throughout the adult nervous system that are capable of repairing the damage caused by multiple sclerosis, but until now, we had no way to direct them to act,' said Prof Tesar.'Our approach was to find drugs that could catalyse the body's own stem cells to replace the cells lost in multiple sclerosis.'As well as testing the drugs on mice affected by MS, the scientists also observed their effect on human OPCs in the laboratory. The response was similar to that seen in mouse cells, with miconazole exerting the most potent effect.Co-author Dr Fadi Najm, also from Case Western Reserve University, said: 'We have pioneered technologies that enable us to generate both mouse and human OPCs in our laboratory.'This uniquely positioned us to test if these drugs could also stimulate human OPCs to generate new myelinating cells.'The drugs also hold out the promise of treatments for other diseases that involve myelin loss or dysfunction, including cerebral palsy, age-related dementia, optic neuritis and schizophrenia, the scientists believe.British immunology expert Professor Daniel Altmann, from Imperial College London, said: 'This study offers the highly attractive possibility of re-targeting existing, safe, drugs for the purpose of promoting therapeutic remyelination.'The data appear to suggest that the drugs can to some extent limit disability in experimental models of MS, though there is clearly much more to be optimised in this area, not least as the models tried thus far do not really look at effects on chronic demyelination.'However, particularly for patients with progressive MS - where it can be difficult to know how to impact the ongoing deterioration, these approaches offer the great advantage that these are tried, tested and safe drugs passed for use in humans.'Some caution is clearly warranted, however, when one considers the long haul from benefits in tissue culture models of myelination to a complex and diverse human disease such as MS.'The findings were published in the journal Nature. "

But then his lifelong passion for science was kindled by service in Vietnam, where he encountered life and death struggles while treating wounded in a military base in DaNang.                                                       Craig Venter reads his entire DNA 'recipe book'                                              In 1984 he joined the US National Institutes of Health where he introduced novel techniques for rapid gene discovery, and left in 1991 to form his own nonprofit research centre where he read all the DNA - sequenced - the first genome in history in 1995, that of a bacterium.           In 1998 he announced that he would sequence the human genome years earlier, and for far less money, than the international government-sponsored Human Genome Project would - a buccaneering challenge that generated unprecedented rivalry, mud slinging and hostility before the rival teams announced they had completed the feat at a ceremony in the White House that made headlines worldwide in 2000.           Mr Venter, now the president of the J Craig Venter Institute, in Rockville, Maryland, came in for much criticism during the genome race because he was so closely identified with efforts to withhold data and commercialise findings so it is striking he decided to publish his DNA sequence today in the journal Plos Biology, which is an open access journal free to anyone with internet access. All six billion letters of Mr Venter's DNA code have been poured into a public computer database called GenBank, so it can provide a reference for future work.           In recent years, Venter has led sailing expeditions to sequence tiny microbial life in the ocean, as well as his ground-breaking attempt to create synthetic life, a lab made bacterium, both to understand how living things work and develop microorganisms able to make biofuels and help curb climate change.           Today's scientific paper reveals another side to his autobiography:           'The individual whose genome is described in this report is J Craig Venter, who was born on 14 October 1946, a self-identified Caucasian male,' it says.

There are documented cases of family members with chronic disease including hypertension and ovarian and skin cancer. According to the genealogical record, the donor's ancestors can be traced back to 1821 (paternal) and the 1700s (maternal) in England.'

telegraph,22/01/2009 07:00,women,"For the super-rich who can’t face losing a beloved dog, there is a genetically engineered solution. But at what ethical cost? Tom de Castella went to California to meet the world’s first commercially cloned puppies. There is a scene in The Loved One, Evelyn Waugh’s novella of 1948, that takes   place at a fictional pet cemetery called the Happier Hunting Ground in Los   Angeles. 'In the presence of a dozen mourners,’ Waugh wrote, 'the coffin of   an Alsatian was lowered into the flower-lined tomb. The Reverend Errol   Bartholomew read the service. “Dog that is born of bitch hath but a short   time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down like a   flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.”’The book is a merciless send-up of the sentimentality of American pet owners   and their inability to cope with death. A sign that Waugh was not greatly   exaggerating came in 2007 when a billionaire hotelier from Connecticut,   Leona Helmsley, died and left a $12 million trust fund to her white Maltese   dog, Trouble. (A judge subsequently reduced it to $2 million.)Americans invest a lot in their pets, emotionally and financially. There are   75 million dogs in the US, with 39 per cent of households owning at least   one dog, according to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association   (in Britain, the figure is about 21 per cent). Last year, Americans spent   $41.2 billion on their animals, and the market has almost doubled since   1998. To find the country’s most passionate pet owners you have to go, like   Waugh, to California.As I stepped off the ferry at Sausalito, San Francisco Bay shimmered in the   midday sun. Ahead of me, in the green, prosperous hills of the Bay Area,   stood Mill Valley, a wealthy, picturesque town where the offices of BioArts   International (which describes itself as 'a biotech startup focusing on   unique, untapped markets in the multi­billion-dollar livestock, companion   animal and human genomics industries’) are located. I had come to see a man   about a dog. Missy was a mongrel who was rescued from a dog pound. She was thought to be   three quarters border collie, one quarter husky, and was adored by her   wealthy California owner. So beloved was she that, in 1998, aged 11, under   the supervision of executives from what would later become BioArts, she was   flown to Texas Agricultural & Military (A&M) University in the town of   College Station to have her DNA preserved for ever. She had been spayed so   was unable to have puppies. In any case, her owner did not want Missy’s   offspring; she wanted an exact replica. It was the beginning of the   Missyplicity Project, the first serious attempt to clone a pet dog. BioArts   had initially invited several institutions to bid for the opportunity to   clone Missy, and chose A&M because of its ground­breaking embryo research   programme.Missy became a canine cause celebre, the subject of numerous press articles   and a 2001 book – Your Pedigree Chum – by the British journalist James   Langton. In those days, no one knew the identity of Missy’s owner, and the   public face of the project was BioArts’s chairman, Lou Hawthorne. Now 48,   Hawthorne was born in Connecticut, the son of a professor of medieval art,   and moved to California when he was five. He grew up with animals – cats,   dogs, chickens, guinea pigs, a turkey called Henrietta. Initially he worked   as a cinematographer in the Bay Area, and once directed a documentary about   Zen Buddhism, but, he says, 'I’ve always had an amateur interest in science,   going back to the word’s root, which is “love”.’ After news of the project spread, pet owners all over the world bombarded   Hawthorne with pleas to clone their beloved animals. Demand was so great   that he set up another company, Genetic Savings & Clone, allowing owners to   bank their pets’ DNA (for a price).Hawthorne had been inspired by the story of Dolly the sheep, the first mammal   to be successfully cloned from an adult cell. She was made, if that is the   word, by scientists at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh in 1996 from a cell   from a ewe’s udder – she is named after Dolly Parton – which was then   transferred to an unfertilised egg cell (from a different sheep) that had   had its nucleus removed. The hybrid cell was then given a jolt of   electricity to spark it into action, before being implanted in a surrogate   mother. The process, somatic cell nuclear transfer, was hardly dependable –   Dolly was the only lamb that survived to adulthood from 277 attempts – but   it remains the only proved method of animal cloning.After Dolly came Polly, a genetically modified lamb engineered to produce a   human protein in her milk that could be given, in theory, to haemophiliacs   and bone disease sufferers. In recent years, monkeys, cats and cattle have   all been successfully cloned, and food is being produced across the world   from animals descended from clones.But dogs, it seemed, were different. Sheep and cattle naturally breed a lot,   unlike dogs, which produce relatively few eggs. As Dr Mark Westhusin of the   Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology Department at A&M University, the   chief scientist on the Missyplicity project in its early days, told Langton   seven years ago, 'The problem with dogs is as much logistical as   technological. In fact, cloning is not as scientifically difficult as people   try to make out. But what you do need is a lot of eggs.’Despite the initial optimism (Westhusin boasted that pet cloning would be   widespread within a few years, costing about £10,000 per pet: 'No more than   a nice piece of jewellery or a car’), cloning Missy proved much more   difficult than imagined.  Hawthorne and A&M diversified their research to other animals. In 2001 the   first cloned cat – named CopyCat – was born. Hawthorne had provided the   university with DNA from a pedigree Himalayan, a 'beautiful cat’, but   scientists at A&M used the DNA of a different donor – an unremarkable   tortoiseshell – without informing him. The donor was orange, black and   white, but because of the way tortoiseshells pass on their genes, the clone   was black and white. In other words, it didn’t resemble the donor animal.   Hawthorne was devastated: 'It created an enduring myth that clones will not   resemble their donor. It was a disaster, as our product is all about   resemblance. A&M were quite proud of it but to me it was terrible news.’   Disillusioned with the scientists at A&M, Hawthorne ended the relationship. Missy died in 2002, aged 15, and her story disappeared from the public   consciousness. Then, at the end of 2007, news emerged that a Missy clone,   Mira, had been born – in South Korea. Soon, there were two more puppies. It turned out that Missy’s wealthy, anonymous owner had been Lou Hawthorne’s   mother, Joan. 'The initial impetus to get into cloning was simply to serve   my family, who wanted a clone of the family dog,’ Hawthorne told me. 'The   deeper I got, the more fascinated I became.’ The project had been funded by   Mrs Hawthorne’s close friend John Sperling, a billionaire educationalist who   set up the University of Phoenix. 'He did not expect to get a return on his   investment,’ Hawthorne said. The project has cost $20 million so far.The cloning of Missy would not have become a reality without Hwang Woo-Suk, a   controversial Korean biomedical scientist. In 2005, more than two years   before the successful cloning of Missy, his researchers at Seoul National   University claimed to have created the first cloned dog, an Afghan hound   called Snuppy (Seoul National University Puppy). Hwang’s reputation grew,   culminating in announcements in 2004 and 2005, backed up by papers in the   respected journal Science, in which he claimed to have cloned a number of   human embryonic stem cells: a crucial breakthrough that could lead to human   cloning. Hwang became a national hero in South Korea and was awarded the title of   Supreme Scientist, the country’s highest scientific honour. But in late   2005, following claims by a whistleblower and an investigative television   programme, it emerged that significant parts of his research had been   fabricated. The following year, Hwang was indicted for fraud and   embezzlement by South Korean prosecutors, who discovered he had helped   himself to $3 million of research funds. He escaped prison, but was fired by   the university and banned by the government from doing any more   human-cloning research. He went to work at the Sooam Bio­engineering   Research Institute in Yongin. Despite Hwang’s downfall, and though some had initially doubted his   dog-cloning claims, his work on Snuppy was still regarded to be genuine.   Hawthorne, having split from the team at A&M, was casting around for new   partners. He decided, controversially, that he would throw his lot in with   Hwang. Hawthorne admits he was anxious. 'I did have some concerns about   working with Dr Hwang because of the whole stem-cell crisis. But his dog   work had been validated so we felt it was in our customers’ best interests   to work with someone who was a master of cloning dogs, regardless of what   else he had failed to do in his life.’ In 2007 Missy’s DNA was flown out to   Hwang in Korea and cloned using the same method that produced Snuppy. Mira   was born in December 2007, the other two puppies in February 2008. BioArts’s PR man, Ed Fogelman, collected me from the Sausalito ferry. After a   short drive, he parked at a small motel-like building in Mill Valley. We   were about to go up to the first-floor offices (no lab work takes place   here) when Farah Shaw, one of BioArts’s six employees, called out. Shaw was   walking a black-and-white puppy, 10 months old. 'Say hello to Mira,’ she   said. I’m not sure what I had been expecting, but Mira looked just   like a normal dog. There was nothing out of the ordinary about her. Of   course, that is the point.We followed Mira upstairs to Hawthorne’s office where we were greeted by her   sibling clones, Chingu and Sarang. The three identical pups did what comes   naturally and made a nuisance of themselves, forcing everyone to reach for   their coffee cups and move their legs as they scampered about. On one wall   of the office was a huge photograph of Missy, a picture of Lassie-like   serenity. The physical resemblance between the generations was clear – those   keen playful faces, the splashes of black-and-white fur – although the husky   seemed to be more pronounced in the clones than in Missy.Hawthorne was dressed in jeans and a black polo shirt, socks and no shoes. The   tan, coiffured Clooney-grey locks and close-cropped beard completed the   California-casual look. Hawthorne introduced the three Missy clones to the   world via a video, posted on YouTube last summer. Tests conducted by the   Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at the University of California concluded   that the three dogs were indeed clones. (There had been two further puppies,   but these died soon after birth.) Mira now lives with Hawthorne, the others   with friends.I asked Hawthorne why, in his opinion, it took so long to get from Missy’s DNA   to a clone, but he didn’t want to dwell on past failures, and has already   moved on to the next phase of the Missyplicity project. He unveiled his   plans in the YouTube clip: 'We’re delighted to be able to offer dog cloning   to the general public through our Best Friends Again programme.’ Best Friends Again was conceived as a potentially lucrative dog-cloning   'auction’, organised in the manner of an eBay sale, open to all. Bids were   invited over a five-day period with the five top bidders getting to clone   their pet. Hawthorne explained that the bidding war raised about $750,000   and he is sure that his customers won’t be disappointed. 'If the client   doesn’t feel [the clone’s resemblance to the parent dog] is extremely high,   comparable to identical twins,’ he told the New York Times recently, 'they   can ask for their money back.’ While the five highest bidders in the BioArts auction remain anonymous,   Hawthorne told me proudly that he had reserved a spot for a sixth dog, whose   owner would not have to pay a cent. James Symington is a former Canadian   policeman turned actor who lives in Los Angeles, where he plays cops in   television soaps and films, while helping out in dog-rescue projects in his   spare time. It was Trackr, his Alsatian, that I wanted to talk to him about.   Symington and Trackr had recently retired from a police search-and-rescue   team in Halifax, Nova Scotia, when news of the 2001 World Trade Center   attacks broke. Knowing Trackr’s unique qualities, and that there was a   shortage of search-and-rescue dogs in New York, Symington drove for 14   hours, and arrived early on September 12.'We found lots of body parts and human debris,’ Symington said. 'It wasn’t   till early morning that Trackr gave me the sign. If he finds a live person,   his body becomes erect, his tail shoots straight up in the air.’ Trackr was   responsible for finding the last survivor from the rubble, Genelle Guzman, a   30-year-old employee of the Port Authority who worked on the 64th floor of   the North Tower.  Last summer, when Symington, 42, saw Hawthorne on television talking about a   competition to clone the most extraordinary, deserving dog, he knew that he   should enter Trackr, now 15. Symington sent off his application to BioArts and   describes the win as the most exciting day of his life. 'What you’ve got to   understand is that Trackr is my best friend and lifelong companion,’   Symington told me. 'He’s changed my life in ways I can’t explain. To know   that his legacy was going to go on is the greatest gift I’ve ever received.   If Trackr’s double has even 70 per cent of him, then I’ll put him to work   for the search-and-rescue team – and I’ll be dusting off my gloves, too.’ Yet many in the scientific community think that pet cloning comes with   unrealistic expectations. 'Anyone thinking they’re going to get Fluffy back   is gravely mistaken,’ says Robert Lanza, the chief scientific officer at the   stem cell research company Advanced Cell Technology. In other words, he   says, identical genes do not result in animals that behave in the same way   because environmental factors are extremely important.Dr Robert Blelloch, an assistant professor at the Institute for Regenerative   Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, has similar doubts:   'What people are getting is not an exact copy.’ While the DNA make-up may be   similar or even identical, how the DNA is presented is almost certainly   going to be different. This is because the process of converting an adult   cell to an embryonic cell by cloning is rarely, if ever, complete and can be   fraught with errors. The result, he says, is often a less fit or   disease-prone animal. 'I think pet cloning is a mistake,’ Blelloch says. 'I   appreciate people’s love for dogs, but cloning will produce a less than   perfect replicate with a high risk for substantial health complications.’ For Blelloch and many other scientists, the proper application of cloning is   not reproductive but therapeutic – stem cell research in which embryos are   cloned to harvest cells that can be used to treat and research diseases in   humans.Of greater concern to Hawthorne is the competition BioArts faces from a rival   dog-cloning organisation. Hwang’s former protege Lee Byeong-Chun, who was   also suspended from Seoul National University over the stem-cell fraud,   along with many of the Snuppy scientists, now works for the Korean company   RNL Bio. Last August RNL unveiled what it described as the world’s first   commercially cloned pet. Once again, a Californian was involved, this time a   former beauty queen, Bernann McKinney, who had paid RNL $50,000 to clone her   pitbull, Booger, who died two years ago. McKinney had sold her house to meet   the cost. 'I had to make sacrifices and I dream of the day when everyone can   afford to clone their pet, because losing a pet is a terrible, terrible loss   to anyone,’ she said. RNL announced that it was open to offers from pet   owners worldwide, and boasted that it could clone up to 300 dogs in 2009.Hawthorne, however, believes that RNL is breaking the law. The patents for   commercial exploitation of the cloning technology developed in Roslin are   held by Start Licensing in Arizona, and Hawthorne insists that BioArts has   an exclusive deal with them. Last October, Start took legal action against   RNL in the South Korean courts – the case is still progressing.So once again, and despite the fact that arguably the most difficult part –   producing a viable clone of Missy – has been achieved, the pet cloning   business has stalled. Seven years ago, Hawthorne was bullish, telling James   Langton, 'We will probably have as many orders as we can handle. Never   underestimate the love some people have for their pets.’ Today, even without   the rivalry with RNL, he admits that the business case for dog cloning is   not what it had seemed. 'I don’t think the dog [cloning] market is that big.   After what has happened to the economy, people still want to send their kids   to the best schools, but it’s a terrible time to be cloning dogs or cats.’It seems surprising, and perhaps a little sad, that after 11 years of   groundbreaking work Hawthorne appears to be turning away from animal cloning   – he told me that BioArts is now building laboratories in China and looking   to diversify into human embryonic stem cell research, as well as   disease-testing techniques for viruses such as avian flu. For him the incredible journey is over; he has achieved what he set out to do.   'I’ve cloned my family dog, we’re cloning a few dogs for the public and one   amazing dog as a public service,’ he said. 'This has been a very interesting   challenge, I’ve learnt a tremendous amount doing it.’The wider world is not, it seems, ready for pet cloning on a grand scale, and   Lou Hawthorne is not going to try to persuade it otherwise. Life is too   short. "
telegraph,20/11/2013 13:37,news,"Frederick Sanger, OM, who revolutionised science and medicine through DNA and protein sequencing, was the only Briton twice to win the Nobel PrizeFrederick Sanger, OM, the biochemist, who has died aged 95, was the only   Briton — and one of only four people in history — to win the Nobel Prize   twice. His work unlocked the chemical secrets that underlie genes — the basic   building blocks of life — and laid the foundation for genetic engineering   and the Human Genome Project, a unique effort to spell out the chemical   structure of every gene in the human body. Sanger was awarded his first Nobel Prize in 1958 for work carried out with   colleagues in the early 1950s. Toiling away in a small hutlike laboratory   buried in Cambridge University’s department of biotechnology , Sanger   deduced the sequence of amino acids (chemical building blocks) in the   hormone insulin, the first complete protein sequence ever to be determined. An introduction to protein sequencingHis second Nobel, in 1980, was awarded for related work carried out at the   Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, where he developed an   ingenious method of working out the basic chemical “grammar” of DNA that has   enabled scientists to “read” the chemical sequencing — the long chains of   DNA molecules — that form our genes. The technique he developed, known as   “Sanger” sequencing, was still used decades later. The DNA sequencing method Sanger pioneered, with Alan Coulson, involves   manufacturing a replica of the gene under study. The next step is to add a   specially coloured “killer chemical” that terminates the replication once it   hits a particular chemical link, or nucleotide, in the gene (DNA chains have   four types of chemical links, and the order of these determines what the   genes do). The process is repeated with different killer chemicals which stop the   replication at different sets of links. This gives a mixture of DNA   fragments of varying lengths, each finishing with one of four different   fluorescent dye molecules corresponding to the four nucleotides of DNA. The   fragments are then driven by an electric field through a slab of gel or   hair-thin capillary tubes filled with polymer. This sorts them by length.   The order of colours that emerges — corresponding to the sequence of   nucleotides in the original piece of DNA — is scanned by laser and displayed   on a computer screen. An excellent and simple video explaining DNA mapping by 'Sanger   sequencing' This method made it possible to sequence several hundred DNA bases in one day,   a process that previously took many years. It enabled Sanger and his   colleagues to map the sequence of links of simple structures such as   proteins and viruses, leading to far greater scientific understanding of the   chemical basis of genetic defects and the processes that lead to disease —   work that has led to an explosion in drug and vaccine development. Frederick Sanger was born on August 13 1918 into a Quaker family at the   village of Rendcomb in Gloucestershire, where his father was the local   doctor. Under his father’s influence and that of his elder brother Theodore,   Fred became interested in biology and set his heart on following his father   into medicine. From Bryanston he won a place at St John’s College, Cambridge, but even before   going to university he decided he would be best suited to a scientific   career — albeit one which he hoped would have clinical applications. At   Cambridge he became interested in the emerging field of biochemistry,   convinced that it offered a way to develop a more scientific basis to   understand many medical problems. But he did not appear to be a particularly   promising student, and took three years to complete the first part of his   degree when normally it took only two. Sanger was a conscientious objector, and after taking his degree in 1939   remained at the university for a further year after the outbreak of war to   take an advanced course in Biochemistry, surprising everyone by obtaining a   First. From 1940 to 1943 he worked with Albert Neuberger on the metabolism   of the amino acid lysine, and at the same time became involved in a   government-sponsored research project looking at the protein content of the   potato. When AC Chibnall was appointed Professor of Biochemistry in 1943, Sanger   joined his research group working on proteins. This was an especially   exciting time in protein chemistry: new chromatography techniques had been   developed by Archer Martin and Richard Synge; and Chibnall and Sanger   believed that there might be a real possibility of determining the exact   chemical structure of proteins. This idea was controversial at the time as, although the 20 or so amino acids   that can go to make up proteins were known, most scientists believed the   arrangement of different amino acids in a protein to be random. One   professor had even produced a complex mathematical formula that would   express this random function. Thus, when Chibnall tried to get Sanger a   grant from the Medical Research Council to work on protein structure, the   grant was refused because “everyone knew” that the pattern of amino acids in   a protein was random. Nevertheless, Sanger scraped together enough money from various sources to   start work. From 1944 to 1951 he held a Beit Memorial Fellowship for Medical   Research; and in 1951, by which time the Medical Research Council had come   to recognise the importance of his work, he became a member of the MRC’s   external staff. The protein which Sanger chose for his research was insulin which, as well as   being relatively small in size and available in large quantities, had strong   clinical implications in the understanding of diseases such as diabetes. He   developed a method of marking the end amino acid and splitting it off from   the insulin. The end amino acid was then identified and the process   repeated. By this painstaking method, Sanger showed that a molecule of   insulin contains two peptide chains made of two or more amino acids that are   linked together by two disulphide bonds. It took eight more years finally to   identify the 51 amino acids that make up insulin. The award of the Nobel Prize in 1958 had an important and stimulating effect   on Sanger’s subsequent career, enabling him to obtain better research   facilities and to attract the brightest young scientists to work alongside   him. In 1962 — with Max Perutz’s unit from the Cavendish Laboratory, which   included Francis Crick, John Kendrew and Aaron Klug — Sanger moved to the   MRC’s newly-built Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. Surrounded by researchers interested in DNA and genes, Sanger was struck by   the challenge of determining the order of bases in DNA — known as DNA   sequencing. It was by this time clear that DNA was a linear code, and   although the code was being unravelled, no methods existed to read the code   in even the simplest genome. To Sanger, though, the problem was simply a   natural extension of his work on protein sequencing. Over the next 15 years he and his team developed several methods to sequence   nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), eventually developing the method for which he   won his second Nobel. The Sanger method is capable of “reading” genomes as   much as 3,000,000,000 base-pairs long — 500 bases at a time. Sanger shared his second Nobel Prize with Walter Gilbert, who had carried out   independent research into the determination of base sequences in nucleic   acids, and Paul Berg, for his work on recombinant DNA. A courteous, serious-minded man of strong socialist opinions, Sanger’s thin,   bespectacled figure, habitually dressed in academic-casual v-necked sweater,   open-necked shirt and rubber-soled shoes, was a familiar sight in Cambridge   for many years. Though he was one of only four people ever to have won two Nobel Prizes (the   others being Marie Curie, John Bardeen and Linus Pauling), he remained   modest about his achievements, putting them down to hard work and team   spirit rather than genius. The walls of his simply-furnished house at Swaffham Bulbeck, a fen-side   village outside Cambridge, were bare of plaques, certificates or citations:   “You get a nice gold medal, which is in the bank,” he explained. “And you   get a certificate, which is in the loft. I could put it on the wall, I   suppose. I was lucky and happy to get it, but I’m more proud of the research   I did. There are some people, you know, who are in science just to get   prizes. But that’s not what motivates me.” After retiring in 1985 Sanger devoted most of his time to working in his   garden. In 1992 the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council   established the Sanger Centre, for furthering the knowledge of genomes.   Located 10 miles outside Cambridge, it became one of the main sequencing   centres of the Human Genome Sequencing Project. A guide the Human Genome ProjectAmong many honours and awards, Sanger received the Corday-Morgan Medal and   Prize of the Chemical Society in 1951; the Royal Medal of the Royal Society   in 1969; the Royal Society’s Copley Medal in 1977; and the Albert Lasker   Basic Medical Research Award in 1979. He won the Gold Medal of the Royal   Society of Medicine in 1983. In 1954 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of King’s   College, Cambridge. He was an honorary member of many foreign scientific   academies, including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Sanger was appointed CBE in 1963 and made a Companion of Honour in 1981 — but   he turned down a knighthood, not wanting to be called “Sir”: “A knighthood   makes you different, doesn’t it, and I don’t want to be different.” He did,   however, accept the considerably more distinguished Order of Merit in 1986. Frederick Sanger married, in 1940, Margaret Joan Howe. She was not a   scientist, but he described her as having contributed more to his work than   anyone else by providing a peaceful and happy home. They had two sons and a   daughter.

telegraph,3/4/2002 14:43,news,"GENE therapy appears to have cured a 'bubble baby' born with no defence against infection, it was revealed today.It would be the first time British doctors have successfully corrected the gene defect that causes Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disorder (SCID).Children born with SCID have no immune system of their own and must be kept in totally sterile conditions - hence the term 'baby in the bubble'.Rhys Evans, born 18 months ago in South Wales, was diagnosed with the form of the disorder that affects boys, known as X-linked SCID, after exhaustive tests failed to show why he was so sickly.His body began to weaken as soon as the immunity acquired from his mother wore off.Antibiotics failed to clear up his recurring chest infections and he was admitted to hospital with pneumonia. His condition deteriorated to the point where he was placed on a ventilator in an intensive care unit.But the timing of his condition meant he was the first baby in the UK who could potentially benefit from ground-breaking gene therapy work taking place at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for children and its research partner the Institute of Child Health.His parents Mark and Marie were offered the chance to put their son on the gene therapy programme last summer. By last Christmas, following intensive treatment, Rhys was already showing signs of improvement.A Great Ormond Street spokesman said: 'In February, Rhys' blood results had made enormous progress and were almost normal. For the first time in his little life, he was allowed to start mixing with other children and playing outdoors, and has even just been on his first family holiday.'Without treatment, a baby born with SCID faces death within the first couple of years.Traditionally the disorder is treated by bone marrow transplantation to provide the missing immune cells. In a healthy child the cells are made from precursor stem cells in the bone marrow.The procedure has a high success rate when there is a matched brother or sister donor, and is modestly successful when the donor is a parent. Nevertheless only a third of children with SCID can be matched with a really good donor.The gene therapy technique being pioneered at Great Ormond Street is aimed at fixing the genetic fault that prevents a SCID child producing immune system cells.A single faulty gene, called gamma c, is believed to be responsible for the failure of the immune system in boys like Rhys.The therapy procedure involves removing bone marrow from the patient and treating it with a virus which carries the correct gene into the stem cells.The corrected bone marrow is then infused into the child and allowed to generate immune cells which pass into the blood."
dailymail,22/04/2015 12:52,sciencetech,"Genetically engineering plants and crops to change their DNA has been a cause of much controversy in recent years.But new research has found that Mother Nature might be making its own GM food, as sweet potatoes have been found to genetically modify themselves.And this seems to have been occurring for thousands of years, meaning humans have been unknowingly eating GM foods for much longer than they thought.The remarkable finding of ‘foreign DNA’ in the vegetable shows that it contains a type of natural genetically modified organism (GMO).The research was conducted by scientists from Ghent University in Belgium and the International Potato Institute (CIP).It is not the first instance of natural GMOs to be found, but it is the first in sweet potatoes - a major crop plant.And the researchers say sweet potatoes all over the world contain this genetic modification.The study focused around bacteria called Agrobacterium, sometimes referred to as ‘nature’s genetic engineer.’It is known to do something called ‘horizontal gene transfer’, which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species.Agrobacterium is specialised to transfer part of its own DNA, called T-DNA, to plants - and it was this T-DNA that was found in sweet potatoes.In total the researchers studied 291 samples of sweet potato from the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania, and found evidence of Agrobacterium in all of them.‘The natural presence of Agrobacterium T-DNA in sweet potato and its stable inheritance during evolution is a beautiful example of the possibility of DNA exchange across species barriers,’ said Dr Lieve Gheysen, one of the researchers involved.‘It demonstrates that genetic modification also happens in nature.’The research suggests that the bacterial DNA may have adapted sweet potato for thousands of years in the natural process.The transgenic process - a gene that has been transferred naturally - is similar to the artificial process induced by humans.However, the difference pointed out by the resarchers is that we can control the man-made process, while the natural process is out of our hands.‘In comparison to 'natural' GMOs, that are beyond our control, human-made GMOs have the advantage that we know exactly which characteristic we add to the plant,’ said Dr Gheysen."
telegraph,8/9/2000 0:00,news,"GENETICALLY modified cells derived from a human foetus will be used to treat British stroke victims in a clinical trial starting next year, it emerged yesterday.The brain cells, which contain a gene from a monkey virus, will be injected through the skulls of a dozen patients with the most common form of stroke. Tests of similar cells in animals have shown that they can repair damaged parts of the brain and restore mobility.The treatment is the latest use of stem cells, the flexible and easily cultured parent cells found throughout the human body. Every type of tissue stems from these cells. The cells used in the clinical trial originally came from the brain of an aborted foetus donated to medical research and were cultured by the biotech company ReNeuron.Once injected into a brain, the neural stem cells continue to divide, spreading through the brain and replacing damaged tissue. Because they are effectively immortal, the cells have been genetically engineered to carry an 'off' switch that stops them dividing once they reach body temperature. The switch is a gene from a monkey virus that has been added to the cell's chromosomes.Yesterday Dr John Sinden, the chief scientific officer of ReNeuron, stressed that the cells were perfectly safe. He told the association: 'When we injected them into the brains of animals they have recovered motor function. The ultimate goal is to produce a treatment for chronic disabilities after stroke.'The announcement coincides with the publication today of new research into the flexibility of stem cells.A paper in today's Science shows that differentiated brain cells can be converted into other types of brain tissue. Dr Toru Kondo and Dr Martin Raff of University College London show that one type of brain cell, called oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which help to protect neurons, can be converted back into neural stem cells using growth factors.Other factors are then used to change the stem cells into two other types of differentiated brain cell, neurons and astrocytes. The finding raises the possibility of removing a tiny sample of brain tissue from a patient, converting it into neural stem cells and then turning them into neurons to treat stroke, Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease."

But over the past year, scientists have decoded the genomes of a human, fruit flies, thale cress and the micro-organisms responsible for cholera and meningitis. Science, which puts together the list each year, said: 'Genome sequencing steamed full ahead this year, as researchers used a synthesis of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science and engineering to decode the script of life in a variety of organisms, from people to fruit flies.'An organism's genome is spelt out in DNA using four chemical letters or bases. Genome sequencing involves decoding the order of bases. The human genome is spelled out in 2.8 billion to 3.5 billion base pairs. Sequencing genetic code allows researchers to investigate the causes of disease and genetically engineer animals.

His family said Wednesday in a statement released by the Packers that Starr is participating in the trial.'Following Bart's strokes, our family began to investigate numerous therapy options,' the family said. 'Several months ago we applied for and were accepted into a clinical trial using stem cells.'Friday we safely returned home from the first of the two treatments,' the family added.Starr, 81, is beloved by Packers fans after leading the team to five NFL championships as well as the first two Super Bowls. He played in Green Bay from 1956 to 1971, and went on to coach the Packers from 1975 to 1983.Starr made regular appearances at Lambeau Field after his retirement.Details of Starr's participation in the study would be shared 'at an appropriate time in the future,' the family said.  They wanted to give Starr a chance to fully participate in the clinical trials and 'let the results, if any, to speak for themselves.'Adult stem cells are undifferentiated cells found throughout the body that can divide rapidly and help repair tissue. The belief is that they can serve as reinforcements to an injured muscle or joint, but there's no definitive proof of that and treatments are considered experimental. The Food and Drug Administration limits such efforts domestically, but clinics elsewhere are much more aggressive.NHL Hall of Famer Gordie Howe, 87, underwent an experimental treatment in Mexico after a stroke left the former defenseman unable to walk and barely able to speak. Howe's family had been offered an opportunity from San Diego-based Stemedica Cell Technologies to take part in a clinical trial in Tijuana.While still cautious, Howe's family said he has had a 'life-changing' turnaround. Howe planned to have another round of treatments in June.The news of Howe's treatment caught the attention of Jerry Kramer, the Packers guard best known for throwing a block that allowed Starr to score a touchdown on a quarterback sneak with 13 seconds left to win the NFL Championship in 1967. The 21-17 victory over Dallas became known as the Ice Bowl for being played in frigid conditions at Lambeau.Starr's family ended up reaching out to Howe's family earlier in the year, said Howe's daughter, Cathy Purnell.Neither Purnell nor Kramer knew where Starr was receiving his treatment. Kramer wasn't sure if Starr's family had heard about stem cell research from others as well.A self-described 'stem cell fan,' Kramer said he has received therapies that have helped with his hip.'There's a tremendous amount of hope, potential and possibilities,' Kramer said about stem cell research in general.Kramer, who turns 80 next year, has been curious about nutrition and aging, especially after the toll his body took from playing in the NFL. He said he has visited labs and spoken to top researchers at Harvard, MIT and the University of Wisconsin.He warned those looking for information on stem cell treatment to focus on leading research labs and universities. Kramer cautioned that it is still unclear how such experimental treatments might affect different patients.But he pointed to Howe's case as one positive sign.'We're all thinking of Bart,' Kramer said, 'all love him, treasure him and hope to God he might get a break on this.'In return, Starr's family has drawn strength from the outpouring of support from friends and fans.'We are working hard toward the one goal he most cherishes: a return to Green Bay for a Packers game,' the family said.___Associated Press writer Betsy Blaney in Lubbock, Texas, contributed to this report.___Online:AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"
telegraph,16/10/2014 08:19,news,"Greenpeace reacts angrily after the former Environment Secretary says opposition toward research on genetically modified food has caused 'enormous suffering'The 'green blob' of environmental interest groups causes thousands   of people to die every day by blocking important research, the former   Environment Secretary has suggested. Owen Paterson said opposition from bodies like Greenpeace towards research on   genetically modified food was 'exploitative' and caused 'enormous   suffering' and 'misery'. He said one of the 'main reasons' 6,000 people were dying a day from   vitamin A deficiency was because some green groups were blocking scientific   progress for 'purely ideological' reasons. Mr Paterson said Greenpeace's protests against golden rice trials in the   Philippines last year were 'utterly wicked' and hampered research   into genetically modified foods. Greenpeace responded, saying it had 'nothing to do' with the GM   trial protest in the Philippines last year and described Mr Paterson's   comments as a 'smear'.Following the interview, the BBC also corrected Mr Paterson's comments.His suggestions that organisations fighting green issues should bear some   responsibility for thousands of deaths every day is likely to be met with   outrage from environmentalists. Mr Paterson, sacked by David Cameron earlier this year in a reshuffle, has   previously blamed his departure on the 'powerful, self-serving'   environmental lobby he regularly clashed with while in office. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today Programme after a high-profile speech on the   environment on Wednesday, Mr Paterson was asked what he meant when he talked   about the 'green blob'. 'The green blob is holding the line. You had Dr [Doug] Parr on from   Greenpeace yesterday and he skirted round [BBC presenter] Justin Webb's   questions questions on golden rice,' Mr Paterson said. 'Since yesterday, 6,000 people have died from vitamin A deficiency and he   batted away Justin's questions on them stopping it. 'It was utterly wicked that last year Greenpeace activists trashed trials   in the Philippines on golden rice. This is a huge problem around the world.'When challenged on the figures, Mr Paterson said they were 'accepted'   World Health Organisation statistics. He added that given it was World Food Day it was timely to be 'looking   exactly at the damage some of these groups do', saying that development   on golden rice had been 'stopped' due to protests. 'It is exploitative. You would bring enormous suffering to an end,   enormous misery. 6,000 people since you had a programme on yesterday have   died because of this failure and one of the main reasons is because   development of it has been blocked by purely ideological reasons by one of   these green groups,' he added. When approached for a reaction, Greenpeace UK pointed to comments by Lawrence   Carter, the body's climate and energy campaigner, about Mr Paterson's speech   at Lord Lawson's Global Warming Policy Foundation. 'When Owen Paterson talks about energy and climate, you can almost hear   the nation's sigh of relief that he's no longer sitting anywhere near the   control room,' Mr Carter said. 'Blinded by ideology, he would happily ignore ninety-seven percent of   climate scientists and scrap the UK's Climate Change Act, putting billions   of pounds of clean energy investments and thousands of jobs at risk. 'It's hard to see how Britain can keep the lights on by replacing proven   clean technologies embraced by fellow G8 economies with a fleet of   pocket-size nuclear reactors that don't even exist yet. This is the kind of   energy policy that might draw whoops and cheers at Lord Lawson's climate   sceptic think tank, but will be laughed off the stage anywhere else. 'Paterson's appointment will go down in history as one of David Cameron's   worst decisions; sacking him, as one of his better ones.'A Greenpeace spokesman added: 'Greenpeace had nothing to do with the GM   trial protest in the Philippines last year, so Owen Paterson's statement on   the Today programme is quite simply false. 'This is the second time Paterson has been caught making stuff up about   Greenpeace, and the second time the Today programme has had to correct him   on air. He has yet to apologise for the first smear, and we won't hold our   breath this time around. 'It's obvious the former minister is so blinded by ideology that his grip   on reality is weakened as a result. The country will be relieved he's no   longer a cabinet minister.' "

[But] if what we are doing is a step forward in curing autism, that is very exciting,' she said.The upcoming trip - which will be the first of four flights to Panama for the trial - is the result of a five-year effort by Ms White to get her son accepted onto the program at Panama's Stem Cell Institute.She initially heard of the Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy for Autismclinical trial - five years ago, but Connor was not accepted onto the Phase 1 study.However, he was recently granted the chance to be a part of this year's study - something that Ms White immediately jumped at as an opportunity to potentially lessen her son's extreme symptoms.This is despite the fact that the treatment is not approved by the FDA - therefore, has not been confirmed as safe and ethical by regulators - and will cost the family an estimated $17,000 in total.See more video at Bangor Daily News The Autism Science Foundation also warns: 'There is no evidence that the treatment is safe or effective for autism, and no guarantee that the stem cells used in these countries are even human.'And Gordon Smith, executive vice president of the Maine Medical Association, told the Bangor Daily News that there is  a risk of scams and fraud for patients traveling abroad for medical treatment.Some facilities may offer false hope instead of genuinely amazing therapies, he said. However, he added that, in the Whites' case, the autism study is listed on the U.S. National Institutes of Health-maintained website - and has apparently been viewed positively by the family's physicians.Indeed, Ms White herself said of the experimental study: '[Connor's] pediatrician and his pediatric nurse have been nothing but supportive through every prior step that has brought us to today.'They understand how much this means to me and what this could mean for Connor.'Connor, nicknamed 'Connor Man' by friends and family, was diagnosed with severe autism at the age of three after exhibiting 'certain behaviors that concerned his doctors' at just one years old.These behaviors included a lack of eye contact, hand-flapping, a lack of speech, odd vocalizations, peculiar toy habits, struggles with change, and hypersensitivity to sounds, according to his family.Due to his condition, Connor could find the flight to Panama on June 7 particularly distressing, said Ms White, who described the stem cell treatment as 'a biochemical reboot' of her son's brain.'Every sound comes at him with equal intensity,' she said, explaining how she and Connor have made frequent visits to Bangor International Airport to prepare him for the upcoming journey.According to the Stem Cell Institute, the adult stem cells that will be used in Connor's treatment come from donated umbilical cord tissue and can possibly reverse some symptoms of autism.The cells can help to regulate patients' immune systems, it says.Connor's family have set up a GoFundMe page to help fund the treatment for the William S Cohen School student, which has apparently been approved by Panamanian food and drug regulators.On the page, Connor is described as a loving boy who 'enjoys long walks, jumping on his trampoline, bouncing on yoga balls, puzzles, eating,  educational games on his IPad and staying busy'.The family has also held numerous fundraising events with support from their community. The study is due to end in 2017. A third phase would need to occur before new medications were sold."
telegraph,18/11/2003 00:01,education,"Hope of an effective treatment for sufferers of cystic fibrosis, the most common genetic disease in Britain, was raised by the announcement of a major gene therapy trial yesterday.All three British groups - Oxford, Edinburgh and Imperial - that have conducted preliminary trials have joined forces to set up the UK CF Gene Therapy Consortium, funded by £15 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.At the European Society of Gene Therapy's annual congress in Edinburgh, the plans to establish a major gene therapy programme to help the one in 2,000 babies born with the disease were outlined by Prof Eric Alton, of the Royal Brompton Hospital and Imperial College London.The faulty CF gene, called the CFTR gene, was isolated in 1989. It causes a problem with the 'electrics' of cells, which leads to the production of heavy mucus and undermines the bacterial defence mechanisms that protect lungs.When the gene replacement trials took place in the spring of 2005, they would be the biggest to have originated in Britain, said Prof Alton. 'We hope to do 60 patients in a multidose trial, and three of those trials in five years.'Five preliminary trials have taken place in Britain already: one in Edinburgh, two in Oxford and two in London. Overall, they showed that it was possible to produce a short-term correction of the underlying genetic defect.The trials suggested that a 25 per cent restoration of normal lung cell function is possible. Of the CF gene therapy trials that have taken place around the world, the British researchers believe that this has come closest to showing how patients can be relieved of a gruelling regime of drugs and physiotherapy. They now want to build on this success.The team plans to transplant a normal version of the faulty CFTR gene in the lining of the lungs of patients with a fat particle called a liposome. Unlike viruses, they can be used again and again without causing an immune reaction.'Putting three teams together is no trivial task, but it has given us a critical mass of 50 people,' said Prof David Porteous of the University of Edinburgh, where he leads the local consortium with Dr Chris Boyd. 'We feel confident that we have got all of the adequate understanding, knowledge and capacity to put into place.'Prof Norman Nevin, the chairman of the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee, said: 'CF is by far the commonest genetic disorder among children. That is the biggest challenge facing scientists and clinicians today.' If the British trial worked, 'it will make a tremendous difference', he said.One of the greatest hurdles facing the use of gene transplants to treat the muscle-wasting disease muscular dystrophy might have been overcome, the congress was told by Prof Jeff Chamberlain of the University of Washington, Seattle.Scientists have been dubious that it will be possible to insert a corrected version of the faulty gene responsible for the disease into all muscles in the body.However, in an experiment on mice with the disease, correction was produced in a range of skeletal muscle by using an adeno-associated virus to insert the gene.Britain had conducted 93 gene transplant trials in the past decade, more than any other European country, Prof Nevin said.Overall, the success had been modest, he said. 'There is a long haul in front of us before gene therapy becomes a bedside therapy.'There have been 505 trials in America and 143 in Europe, 93 of these in Britain. Three quarters of the British trials were aimed at developing a new treatment for cancer."
telegraph,14/09/2005 00:01,news,"Human embryos have been created in Britain without using sperm for the first time.          The 'virgin conception' embryos, which mark a new way to grow a woman's cells and tissues for a vast range of treatments, were revealed by an Edinburgh team. The development is the second time in as many days that the nation's scientists have pushed back the boundaries of reproductive science.          On Thursday approval was given to experiments to create embryos from three people to develop a novel treatment for a class of genetic disease.           In the short term, the new work will shed fresh light on hereditary diseases, the problems caused by cloning and on what happens when the regulation of genes in development goes awry.          Dr Paul De Sousa told the British Association meeting in Dublin that the human embryo in question resulted not from a fertilised egg but from an egg that had been tricked into dividing. Dr De Sousa works at Edinburgh University but did the work at the nearby Roslin Institute, where Dolly the sheep was cloned.          He said it took around 300 human eggs to create half a dozen blastocysts - human embryos that consist of around 50 cells, which can be used as a source of stem cells that can be grown into all 200 or so types in the body.          Although attempts to grow stem cells from the blastocysts have not yet succeeded, as they have in non-human primates, Dr De Sousa was confident that it was only a matter of time. The embryos were grown by a process called parthenogenesis, which means 'virgin birth' in Greek.           Although some scientists had thought that the use of 'parthenotes' in this research would sidestep objections from pro-life groups, Dr De Sousa said that this was not the case.          'Someone who has a pro-life outlook will regard any usage of eggs and embryos for non-reproductive purposes as objectionable.'          Most plants can multiply by parthenogenesis and so do all fungi and many animals, such as corals. But humans, like other mammals, do not because of a gene regulation process called imprinting. This ensures that genes from the mother and father must contribute if development in the womb is to reach term.          Initially, scientists are interested in using cells from parthenotes to shed light on cloning, which disrupts imprinting, and on the links between faulty imprinting and disease. Parthenogenesis also offers the opportunity to grow cells from a woman suffering from a serious genetic disease, so that a detailed study can be made of the cellular effects of the disease.          To create the parthenotes, immature human eggs are taken, with consent, from women who have been sterilised then grown in the laboratory.          Around half can be successfully matured this way and persuaded to divide with a shock of electricity. But only five in every 100 will grow to the blastocyst stage and then with only half the usual number of cells.          Dr De Sousa emphasised that there were no plans to implant the embryos to create a pregnancy.          The parthenote retains the full set of DNA from the egg donor and can be used to make her stem cells. If imprinting errors do not interfere, 'tissue we could derive from such an egg and embryo would be compatible for transplantation', he said.           In theory, these stem cells could be used to grow replacement brain tissue for a woman who had developed Parkinson's disease."

He said it took around 300 human eggs to create half a dozen blastocysts - human embryos that consist of around 50 cells, which can be used as a source of stem cells that can be grown into all 200 or so types in the body.          Although attempts to grow stem cells from the blastocysts have not yet succeeded, as they have in non-human primates, Dr De Sousa was confident that it was only a matter of time. The embryos were grown by a process called parthenogenesis, which means 'virgin birth' in Greek.           Although some scientists had thought that the use of 'parthenotes' in this research would sidestep objections from pro-life groups, Dr De Sousa said that this was not the case.          'Someone who has a pro-life outlook will regard any usage of eggs and embryos for non-reproductive purposes as objectionable.'          Most plants can multiply by parthenogenesis and so do all fungi and many animals, such as corals. But humans, like other mammals, do not because of a gene regulation process called imprinting. This ensures that genes from the mother and father must contribute if development in the womb is to reach term.          Initially, scientists are interested in using cells from parthenotes to shed light on cloning, which disrupts imprinting, and on the links between faulty imprinting and disease. Parthenogenesis also offers the opportunity to grow cells from a woman suffering from a serious genetic disease, so that a detailed study can be made of the cellular effects of the disease.          To create the parthenotes, immature human eggs are taken, with consent, from women who have been sterilised then grown in the laboratory.          Around half can be successfully matured this way and persuaded to divide with a shock of electricity. But only five in every 100 will grow to the blastocyst stage and then with only half the usual number of cells.          Dr De Sousa emphasised that there were no plans to implant the embryos to create a pregnancy.          The parthenote retains the full set of DNA from the egg donor and can be used to make her stem cells. If imprinting errors do not interfere, 'tissue we could derive from such an egg and embryo would be compatible for transplantation', he said.           In theory, these stem cells could be used to grow replacement brain tissue for a woman who had developed Parkinson's disease."
telegraph,23/11/2001 00:00,comment,"I AM convinced that the systematic manipulation of life through cloning, namely creating new lives for scientific research, is a dereliction of our ethical responsibilities. There has rarely been a stronger case for serious political attention to be given to a scientific issue.Last week's High Court judgment revealed a disturbing chasm in our legislation, by rejecting the Government's intention to allow cloning only for experimental reasons. The Government has now introduced an emergency Bill in response to this judgment. There is indeed a need to act quickly, but the legislation must be well focused.When the Government enacted regulations in January to permit research on cloned embryos and other embryos, strong opposition was voiced by the leaders of many faiths to such a decision being made with little parliamentary debate and without introducing new primary legislation. Last week's ruling has offered our society the welcome opportunity to think again about what the law should do: allow some human cloning, or ban it altogether.This rushed legislation squanders that opportunity. The Government's proposed Bill does nothing to stop the creation of a human clone: it merely prohibits the transfer of the cloned human embryo to the body of a woman. The clone may be treated in any conceivable way, with no time limit on experimentation, as the High Court judgment makes clear. Experimental cloning is left wholly unregulated. The Bill merely prevents an attempt, in this country, to give the clone a chance of being born. It is often suggested that 'therapeutic' cloning is simply the production of stem cells for research - thus glossing over the creation of the cloned embryo from whom the cells are taken.The Government, meanwhile, has wished to argue in favour of cell nuclear replacement for such a purpose, while opposing 'human cloning', suggesting that this would be banned. This court judgment makes clear that the technique of cell nuclear replacement - whereby a nucleus from an adult cell is inserted into an egg from which the nucleus has been removed - is itself the cloning of a new human organism. In other words, the Government is in favour of human cloning, provided the newly created cloned embryo is not permitted to survive.Cloning results in the creation of a human life - an embryo that, if implanted in the womb, would grow up to be a baby. It is a way of creating new human lives, totally and radically divorced from the human act of love. A clone will have no father, as no sperm is used, and the 'mother' will be reduced to the provider of an almost empty ovum.How many women will come under pressure to allow their eggs to be used to make a clone, with the promise that this will help to find a cure for a sick family member?To sanction the creation of new human lives with no genetic parents is an innovation with massive ethical and long-term social implications. The late Cardinal Winning was surely right to regard human cloning as crossing 'a moral Rubicon'.The advocates of cloning point to the benefits of research on embryonic stem cells. They argue that, even if human embryos are created by this process and then destroyed by harvesting the stem cells they contain, the prospective medical gains are so great that this is a price worth paying - the end justifies the means.There are two responses to this approach: it is unnecessary, and it is wrong. It is unnecessary because human embryos are not the only source of stem cells for research. Science in this area is advancing with astonishing speed, and treatments using adult stem cells are already being carried out successfully on patients. In contrast, there are no existing treatments using early embryonic stem cells.Embryonic stem cell research has been much hyped, not least for commercial reasons. However, the fact that there are significant commercial interests involved through investments made in embryo research in this country should not dictate our laws in this area.Experimental cloning is wrong because the end does not, in fact, justify the means. The end - medical treatment - is good, but the means involve the creation and destruction of new human lives. This is intrinsically immoral. An embryo is not an accidental collection of cells. It is an organism with its own internal structure that is in a process of constant development. The embryo and the human adult are the same organism at different stages of growth and maturity. The embryo may not evoke the same emotional reaction as the picture of a developed foetus in the womb. But from a moral point of view, does size or appearance matter? Are not all of us 'collections of cells'?From the moment a human embryo is formed there is a new human life that deserves the protection of the law. I believe that we have a responsibility to speak in defence of human life at all its stages and to ask our political leaders to bring forward legislation accordingly.This is confirmed by the widespread concern about the dangers of human cloning, not only in this country, but also in other European countries and America. Indeed, the US House of Representatives has legislated against cloning for any purpose, and the European Parliament has voted repeatedly against human cloning and the creation of embryos for research.When it considers the emergency legislation this week, Parliament needs to avoid all ambiguities and recognise that, far from banning cloning, the Government in fact proposes to allow cloning, provided the clone is destroyed. 'Therapeutic' and 'reproductive' cloning are the same procedure: the only difference lies in how we plan to treat the clone.It is for this reason that the green light given to 'therapeutic' cloning was welcomed by Dr Severino Antinori, since it will help him with his plans to create a cloned embryo, and bring it to term. If the Government is serious about wishing to ban human cloning - whether for research or for birth - then it must ban it altogether."
telegraph,10/2/2014 15:31,news,"In what is believed to be a world first legal case of its kind, an organic farmer in Australia is suing his neighbour – who grows genetically modified crops - for contaminating his propertyAn organic farmer in Australia is suing his neighbour - who grows genetically   modified crops - for “contaminating” his property in a landmark case that   could affect farmers around the world. Steve Marsh, who owns an organic oat and sheep farm, is suing his neighbour   and former childhood friend, Michael Baxter, whose genetically modified   canola allegedly blew about a mile over the fence into Mr Marsh’s farm and   affected 70 per cent of his crops. Mr Marsh’s farm was certified organic in 2010 by the national sustainable   farming association, which has zero tolerance for genetically modified   material and later withdrew the certification. Commencing a three-week trial in the Western Australia Supreme Court, Mr Marsh   argued that his neighbour should have taken greater care to prevent the   canola seeds escaping. “[Mr Baxter] failed to contain the genetically modified seeds, and they   escaped on the wind onto the Marsh property -- thousands of seeds were   deposited on Eagle Rest,” Mr Marsh’s barrister, Richard Niall, told the   court. “At the time he planted the canola, he knew ... that GM seed would escape. 'It was plainly foreseeable.”The case has divided the small farming town of Kojonup, about 150 miles from   Perth, and pitted pastoralists, who tend to support Mr Baxter, against   environmentalists, who tend to support Mr Marsh. But it could also lead to   changes in the rules for organic farms and rules governing genetically   modified crops. Mr Baxter has argued that Australia’s organic certifier is unreasonably strict   and that his neighbour’s produce would not have been contaminated. The organic sheep would not be affected by eating genetically modified seeds,   he said, and crops such as oats cannot cross-breed with canola seeds. John Snooke, from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western   Australia, said Mr Baxter “has done nothing wrong'. “Michael Baxter grew a legal crop, he complied to all the rules and   regulations,” Mr Snooke told ABC News. Mr Marsh’s case is being partly funded by a “crowd-sourced” internet appeal. Mr Baxter’s case is being backed by Monsanto, an American firm that develops   and sells genetically modified seeds. Mr Marsh is seeking about $AUS85,000 (£46,000) in compensation but the case is   expected to have a far broader impact and could lead to changes in the   labelling of organic food. Karinne Ludlow, a law lecturer at Monash University, said the case would   decide “whether GM agriculture can co-exist with organic agriculture'. She said the case could also force organic food certifiers in countries such   as Australia to relax their stringent approach. In some countries, such as the United States, certifiers allow food with low   levels of genetically modified material to be labelled organic and farmers   are not stripped of organic status if the contamination of crops is   accidental. “Farmers in Australia should have access to the best technologies available,   goodness knows we need them to so that we can continue to feed the growing   population whilst battling more severe weather extremes,” said Dr Andrew   Jacobs, from The University of South Australia. “Hopefully sanity prevails and a common law position that supports the rights   of all farmers to choose what they grow on their properties prevails.”"
telegraph,22/11/2014 17:19,news,"Inquest hears how failure of previously successful stem cell technique led to deaths of four children at Great Ormond Street HospitalFour children died at Great Ormond Street Hospital after the unexpected   failure of a previously successful technique for freezing stem cells, an   inquest has heard. Problems with the freezing process led to the failure of bone marrow   transplants for eight children aged between one and 12 who were suffering   from cancer. Four of them died in the space of a year. Great Ormond Street, Britain’s best-known children’s hospital, has now   admitted that one of the children, four-year-old, might have survived had it   acted with more urgency when problems first arose. The inquest into the children’s deaths heard doctors were initially baffled as   to why a decade of success using the procedures came to a sudden end in the   summer of 2013. The hospital initially failed to pinpoint the reason for the apparent failure   of the freezing technique at its cryo- preservation laboratory, where stem cells were kept for use in transplants in   children whose bone marrow has been damaged during chemotherapy. Concerns were first raised when Sophie Ryan-Palmer, 12, who had acute   lymphoblastic leukaemia, failed to make progress after her transplant in   June 2013, which involved using a donor’s stem cells rather than her own. She had been diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of two and had undergone   three previous transplants. She began fundraising for cancer charities when   she was six. By October last year the hospital had identified that a higher than usual   proportion of eight children who had undergone stem cell transplantation   between March and August had suffered what doctors call “delayed   engraftment”. But by the time it stopped freezing stem cells on site at its   base in Bloomsbury, central London, and launched an investigation, three of   the eight had died. Ryan Loughran, aged 13 months, from Bournemouth, died on July 10. Sophie, from   Sunbury in Middlesex, followed on July 17. Katie Joyce, from Hertfordshire,   died on October 6. A fourth patient, Muhanna al-Hayany, aged five, died in   August this year. He had come from Kuwait to have the treatment. Following   the deaths it was discovered that the method used to freeze the stem cells   had inexplicably stopped working and that, although still alive, the cells   were unable to mature properly. At the inquest, Katie Beattie, the barrister representing Katie Joyce’s   family, questioned whether the girl’s transplant in August should have been   suspended, knowing Sophie and Ryan had died the previous month. Great Ormond   Street went ahead even though there was “plenty of time to stop it”, she   said. Doctors from the hospital told St Pancras coroner’s court that they regretted   not halting transplants sooner and Katie’s life might have been saved if   they had. But they said they believed they were doing the right thing by   continuing with the transplants because “cancer doesn’t wait”. Great Ormond Street said it has since overhauled its procedures to prevent   further incidents, but is still investigating why the freezing process   stopped working. A spokesman said: “Before giving our patients any frozen cells we carried out   tests, which are standard across most laboratories in the UK, to ensure they   were alive and viable. All of the samples passed these tests, so there was   nothing to suggest there was a problem at this stage.”The coroner, Mary Hassell, is expected to deliver verdicts on all four deaths   on Tuesday.

telegraph,31/07/2012 09:00,news,"Leading on from the sequencing of genetic code, scientists can now use computer scripts to simulate life, reports Roger Highfield.Scientific breakthroughs are often sparked when different ways of thinking   collide. For instance, the biotechnology revolution dates to the middle of   the last century, when biologists studying genetics began to work with   physicists who were using X-rays to study the atomic structure of matter.   This gave us our first glimpse of DNA’s elegant double-helix structure, the   secret of inheritance, and launched the specialism of molecular biology.Today, new possibilities are spiralling out of another merger between   different streams of scientific thought: one focusing on the DNA   instructions that determine how to build and operate a living thing, and the   second on the codes used to run computers. This neatly coincides with the   centenary of the birth of Alan Turing, the British-born code breaker who   invented the mathematics of computing and brought new insights into living   patterns.One American scientist who is doing more than most to fuse biology with   computing is Craig Venter, who is best known for being the first to sequence   the entire human genetic code, or genome, and for his scientific   swagger: the first entire human genome to be sequenced was his own.Earlier this month, Venter gave a public lecture at Trinity College Dublin   before an audience of the great and good, including both the Taoiseach, Enda   Kenny, and the DNA pioneer and Venter’s rival in the human genome race, Jim   Watson (of Watson and Crick fame).Professor Luke O’Neill of Trinity had invited Venter to revisit a milestone   series of lectures in 1943, when Erwin Schrödinger, the Austrian quantum   mechanics genius, turned his great mind to the question, what is life?How can a fertilised egg contain “an elaborate code script involving all the   future development of the organism”, he asked. Schrödinger envisaged an   “aperiodic crystal” – one with a complex, non-repeating pattern of   constituent atoms – and described how the “well-ordered association of   atoms” within it could, like dashes and dots of Morse code, hold the   instructions to build the organism.Prof O’Neill said that this was the first serious discussion of the genetic   code. Like many of his contemporaries, Schrödinger had mistakenly assumed   that the genetic code was written in a protein rather than a nucleic acid.   Nonetheless, the 1944 book based on his lectures inspired many, not least   Watson and Venter. “His writings on the 'code script’ were highly predictive   of future discoveries,” Venter told the audience.Now Venter is writing his own code scripts, using a computer to design   genomes. “My team’s work on synthesising genomes based on digital code in a   computer illustrates the ultimate link between computers and biology,” he   said.In fact, life cannot only be designed by a computer: we can model a living   cell too. A few days ago, in the journal Cell, details of the feat were   described by a team at Stanford University led by Markus Covert, working   with Venter’s research organisation. The cell in question is the simplest   bacterium of all, Mycoplasma genitalium, which inhabits the human genital   tract. It has the smallest known genome of a living thing, and was the   second free-living organism to be sequenced, in research Venter presented in   1995.Mycoplasma has now become the first organism to be modelled in detail, down to   every one of its 525 genes. Using 128 computers, Covert’s team charted the   lifespans of mycoplasma cells at the molecular level, from the DNA to the   other kind of genetic material, RNA, to the soup of small molecules known as   metabolites. This is a heroic undertaking: to simulate the division of a   single Mycoplasma takes 10 hours.Virtual cells will help scientists see the wood for the trees. When they talk   about a “cancer gene”, they mean they have found a gene that, when   disrupted, contributes to cancer. But study a cancer cell in detail and you   find that vast numbers of the body’s 23,000 or so genes are affected;   modelling the genomic ensemble will be crucial for understanding the genetic   underpinning of disease. The recent merger of digital and biological worlds, where computers are used   to model life, design life and “regenerate life from the digital world”   marks a turning point. Standing on the same stage used by Schrödinger seven   decades earlier, Venter argued that we are closer than ever to answering the   biggest question of all: what is life?Roger Highfield is the director of external affairs at the Science Museum   Group"
telegraph,22/05/2005 00:01,comment,"Leslie Burke is a 45 year old man who has an incurable and degenerative brain disease. Sooner or later, he will be hospitalised and lose the ability to communicate. When that happens, he has asked that his right not to be starved or dehydrated to death be upheld by the doctors who treat him.           The Department of Health, along with the British Medical Association, opposes that right and is adamant that it will not guarantee to respect it unless it is forced to do so by the courts. So it has taken the decision of the High Court, which upheld Mr Burke's right not to be starved to death, to the Court of Appeal, in the hope of overturning it. A lawyer acting on behalf of Patricia Hewitt, the Health Secretary, explained the basis of her position by saying that 'life-prolonging medical treatment has very serious implications for the functioning of the NHS', and would lead to 'inefficient and unfairly skewed use of resources'.          This is the first time that the Department of Health has admitted what has long been obvious: that it stops feeding and hydrating patients, not because it is in their 'best interests', but because it believes that it costs too much. The idea that it must be in a patient's 'best interests' to be starved to death has always been nonsense. That, however, has not stopped health ministers and NHS officials from resolutely maintaining that particular fiction.           The Department of Health and the BMA refuse to recognise Mr Burke's right not to be starved and dehydrated to death because they fear it will create a generalised 'right to treatment' - which in turn will mean that doctors will be obliged to provide medical treatment to terminally ill patients who want it, regardless of whether it will have any beneficial effect, and regardless of the cost.          Feeding and providing liquids to a patient too damaged to feed himself is not, however, medical treatment - any more than feeding a baby is medical treatment. It was categorised as such by the Law Lords in 1993, and for the sole purpose of allowing the judges to conclude that, in withdrawing food and liquids from Tony Bland (the Hillsborough victim then in a persistent vegetative state), doctors were not unlawfully killing him: they were merely not treating him. If doctors were not to be seen as licensed killers, those two activities had to be kept separate.           It is chilling that the effect of that decision should now be that the Department of Health and the BMA believe that they have a 'generalised right' to starve critically ill patients to death. Feeding a patient is the most elementary part of care that the NHS has an obligation to provide. No one would claim that it was acceptable for a mother to starve her baby to death because the cost of feeding it took up too large a portion of her budget. The ethics which apply to doctors in the NHS should be no different.          Last week, there was also enormous excitement over developments in stem cell research. British scientists have successfully managed to clone embryos, which are an important source of stem cells. Korean scientists have successfully managed to extract stem cells from cloned embryos. Those cells, it is argued, have enormous potential to cure dozens of currently untreatable diseases, for they have the ability to turn themselves into any kind of cell in the body, from nerves to muscles. Cures through stem cell therapy are not imminent, because no one yet understands how or why stem cells convert themselves into a specific kind of tissue, or how to ensure that they do so safely in a patient whose own nerve, brain, muscle or whatever cells are faulty. Still, if therapies based on stem cells can be safely used, they will one day, perhaps, represent life-improving treatments for thousands of people.          Countless millions will be spent in the effort to discover whether stem cell therapy can ever be made to work. The Secretary of State for Health, however, believes that it is not worth spending even a small proportion of that money to feed the terminally ill. The message is disturbingly clear. Very sick people who cannot afford private nurses and doctors, and who are dependent on the NHS for their care, should not expect miracle cures: they will be lucky if they manage to avoid being starved to death. It is a terrifying indictment of an organisation and profession that is supposed to care for the sick, not kill them off. "

Sir John Sulston: former director of the Sanger Center and leader of the UK effort to sequence the human genome announces the completion of the mapping of the human genome          Prof Francis Collins said humans are made up of fewer genes than was previously thought and by 2020 it will be possible to create GM humans with reasonable safety by 'germ line gene therapy'.Within another decade, this would lead to a 'chilling debate' about whether humans should alter their own biology. Prof Collins, one of the senior figure in the global effort to unravel the secrets of the human genetic code, was addressing senior scientists and politicians at the World Life Sciences Forum in Lyons.He predicted that, within a decade, most common disease genes would be known, general practitioners would begin to use genetic medicine, and widespread debate would be triggered by the use of pre-implantation diagnosis - where embryos can be screened for disease before implantation.Prof Collins forecast that by 2020 it would be possible to tailor drugs to suit an individual's genetic make-up to ensure that they do not cause side- effects, to design a cancer therapy to combat individual tumours in a patient and to make big advances in treating mental illness.'We are certainly close to understanding hereditary contributions to mental illness, to schizophrenia, to obsessive compulsive disorder, to autism, in a way that should lead us at last to a better biological understanding of the vexing problems and perhaps an opportunity to stop blaming the victims and treat them as victims of a disease that deserves compassion and better opportunities for therapy.'He believes that by 2020 it will be possible to repair genes before they are passed to the next generation. 'I wouldn't be surprised if in another 30 years some people will begin to argue that we ought to take charge of our own evolution and should not be satisfied with our current biological status.'However, he added: 'I find this an interesting but somewhat chilling discussion. I think from my own perspective that is an enterprise that I hope we would not undertake for a long time, if ever.'But Prof Collins gave a warning against genetic determinism, the mistaken belief that all human characteristics can be boiled down to DNA so that people are merely 'robots that are controlled by invisible signals from our DNA sequences'.

Understanding the human genome will not help us very much to understand the spiritual side of humankind, or to know who God is or what love is.'The professor underlined this by explaining the perils of using genetics to enhance traits, given the profound influence of environment on behaviour. He described the example of rich parents who hoped to produce a baby genetically enhanced to be artistic and musical but ended up with 'a sullen adolescent who smokes marijuana and doesn't talk to them'.At the same time, computer simulations of human cells would be used in medical research to replace animal experiments, and the average human lifespan - in the developed world - would probably stretch to 90. There are a 'number of significant surprises' in the forthcoming human genetic code analysis, which will be published in Science and Nature next week in 36 papers.He said: 'We don't have as many genes as we thought we did.' The analysis will be a 'milestone of the highest order', said Prof Collins. He added that the finished human genetic sequence would be published in 2003."
telegraph,10/9/2013 18:30,news,"Matthew Kaufman, who has died aged 70, was the co?discoverer of a method to extract stem cells from the embryos of mice and grow them in laboratory conditions, unlocking the potential for research into stem cell biology, gene therapy and cloning.in 1980 Kaufman, a lecturer in anatomy at Cambridge and a talented   embryologist, was conducting research on haploid mouse embryos – embryos   conceived by parthenogenesis . Primordial haploid embryos grow more slowly   than those with the full complement of chromosomes, and have a smaller inner   cell mass (ICM); so Kaufman devised a way to raise their ICM by  removing   the parent mouse’s ovaries and injecting the rodent with hormones. Under   these conditions the embryo did not attach itself to the wall of the uterus   and begin to develop; instead it remained in the uterus in a free-floating   state, where cell mass increased without embryonic development.  When   applied to normal – or diploid – blastocysts, the technique could double,   triple, or even quadruple the number of stem cells.This proved useful to Martin Evans, who  was working in Cambridge University’s   Department of Genetics, having spent much of the previous decade studying   embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, which are derived from abnormal growths but   mimic many of the properties of early embryos. Evans’s attempts to gather   stem cells directly from healthy embryos  had been unsuccessful . Hearing   this, Kaufman told Evans of his own “trick” to increase the number of stem   cells. Kaufman and his technician prepared several blastocysts, their long oblong   cells resembling sausages, or, as Kaufman would have it, Graf Zeppelins.   When Evans cultivated them, he soon noticed the formation of small EC-like   cells. They were  capable of developing into several different cell types –   and could be cultured in Petri dishes indefinitely. The pair dubbed them “EK   cells”, for Evans-Kaufman. In the same year Gail Martin, working  at the University of California, San   Francisco, also managed to isolate and grow cells directly from early   embryos; she is credited with coining the term “embryonic stem cells”, or ES   cells. At the time the full significance of the achievement was not apparent, and it   fell to Evans over the years that followed to explore the possibilities in   the field of genetic modification.  Kaufman, meanwhile, pursued his   interests in mouse developmental anatomy. His Atlas of the Mouse Development   (1992) remains the leading textbook on the subject.  Matthew Howard Kaufman was born in London on September 29 1942 and attended   Westminster City Grammar School before moving to Edinburgh to read Medicine,   qualifying in 1967. He worked as a surgeon and obstetrician in Birmingham   before turning to research in reproductive biology at Edinburgh University’s   Institute of Animal Genetics, where he studied aspects of in-vitro   fertilisation (IVF). From 1970 he began a PhD in physiology at Cambridge,   becoming a lecturer in the university’s anatomy department and a director of   studies and lecturer in anatomy at King’s College. By 1985 he was a professor of anatomy at the University of Edinburgh and   curator of the anatomy collections, which included some 300 life and death   masks (plaster casts of an individual’s features) from the 18th and 19th   centuries. Kaufman organised these into a major exhibition in 1988,   comprising 45 masks of such famous figures as Sir Isaac Newton and Sir   Walter Scott.  In later life he published several books on the history of medicine, ranging   in subject matter from the treatment of musket ball and sabre injuries   during the 19th century, to an account from 2005 of the Edinburgh   Phrenological Society and a biography of the Scottish surgeon Robert Liston   (2009).

telegraph,28/06/2001 00:00,news,"MEN in Birmingham are to be turned into genetically modified organisms in an attempt to cure their prostate cancer, scientists said this week.The new trial, which begins next month, is the first in the world to see if a genetically engineered virus can turn prostate cancer cells into targets for anti-cancer drugs. Potentially, it promises treatment for men with early forms of the disease.First they will be injected with a common cold virus which has been genetically modified to carry a gene called nitroreductase. This will produce a protein molecule in the prostate cells capable of activating the anti-cancer drug which will be delivered later.But because the men will receive a genetically modified virus, under health and safety regulations they will become, in effect, genetically modified organisms. For about two days they will be treated in isolation in special rooms and be seen only by doctors and nurses wearing masks and protective clothing.Dr Nick James, reader in oncology at Birmingham University said yesterday: 'There are a lot of concerns about GMOs. The steps we are taking are quite draconian. The research involves a whole raft of regulations that we would normally have to follow.'Dr James said his team had sought the approval of the Government's Genetic Therapy Advisory Committee. He said the measures were a precaution, because although the virus is not activated, regulations still rule that it is a genetically modified organism.Unlike conventional chemotherapy, gene therapy can be targeted to a tumour, avoiding damage to healthy tissues. Scientists have already developed 'pro-drugs' which are usually harmless but are converted into toxic forms in the presence of a chemical trigger. By genetically engineering cancer cells with the trigger, they can mark out the tumours for attack.The new trial, which will take place in two stages, will see if this approach works in early prostate cancer. Men with prostate cancer who will have surgery anyway will be given the virus and then the pro-drug CB1954, originally derived from mustard, which has been developed by the Cancer Research Campaign.Samples of their prostate tissue will be analysed after surgery. These men will have no benefit from the treatment but their results will help doctors move to the second stage. In the second stage, men with early prostate cancer will go through the same process with the expectation that the treatment will be effective. Up to 30 men will be treated in this way.The announcement was made at the Third Global Conference for Cancer Organisations in Brighton this week.Dr James said: 'We are keen that men with early-stage prostate cancer should put themselves forward for the trial, which could open up an entirely fresh approach to treating the disease.

(AP) — Vermont's first-in-the-nation law requiring the labeling of foods made with genetically modified organisms could cost the nation's grocers up to $10 million a day in fines, according to a letter from an industry organization that is suing the block the law.The letter to Gov. Peter Shumlin from the head of the Grocery Manufacturers Association, dated Wednesday, said companies could be fined up to $1,000 a day per unlabeled item — a can of soup or a box of cereal, for instance — that mistakenly ends up on store shelves.  The law is due to take effect next year.'Even with the best of intentions, excellent supply chain logistics and herculean efforts, product will be in the wrong place at any given time, resulting in millions upon millions of dollars in potential fines,' said GMA President Pamela G. Bailey.She estimated more than 100,000 items sold in the state would require Vermont-specific labels, a companies could quickly amass millions in fines if only 5 to 10 percent of products slip through.Shumlin had a clear response Thursday: 'Just label your products. All of them nationwide.'He said labeling foods with genetically modified organisms — which can include food made from seeds that were originally engineered in laboratories to have certain traits, like resistance to herbicides — is already required by 64 countries.'The industry's real concern is that as goes Vermont so will go America,' Shumlin said. 'Plain and simple Vermont's law is about giving consumers the right to know what is in their food. For too long consumers in America have been denied that right.'Bailey said members of the association have determined that changing labels to comply with Vermont's law will cost more than they earn selling their products in the state.'A $10 million per day fine to comply with the labeling law of the second smallest state in the Union is hugely problematic for an industry that employs 14 million U.S. workers and represents the largest sector of manufacturing,' she said.A proposal pending in Congress would block mandatory GMO labeling efforts such as Vermont's and others being considered by a number of states. The bill, introduced by Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., provides for voluntary certification from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Much of the country's corn and soybeans are genetically modified, with much of that going to animal feed. GMO corn and soybeans can also be made into popular processed food ingredients like high-fructose corn syrup and soybean oil.The Vermont law calls for labeling processed GMO foods and for retailers to post signs on displays of unpackaged genetically engineered foods. It also sets a civil penalty of $1,000 per day per product.Throughout the legislative and legal debate on GMO labeling, industry groups have argued there is no difference between foods made with GMOs and other foods.The Grocery Association argues in its federal lawsuit to block the law that the First Amendment gives them broad discretion about what to include on their labels and that there's no compelling state interest to offset that.The legal case is pending.Bailey acknowledged in her letter the association is trying to block the law in court, but until that happens it is working to comply.'We would appreciate the opportunity to work cooperatively with the state to minimize the liability that almost certainly will arise despite the best efforts of the GMA member companies, as well as others in the industry,' the letter said."
telegraph,23/02/2005 00:01,news,"Natural implants created from a patient's own 'building block' cells could radically improve operations for soft tissue reconstruction, breast and lip enlargement and wrinkle removal.          Scientists said yesterday that they had developed a new technique using adult stem cells to grow correctly formed sections of natural tissue.          Although still in its early stages, the breakthrough could avoid some of the dangers associated with artificial implants and shrinkage that often occurs when tissue taken from other parts of a patient's body is implanted.          Jeremy Mao, director of the tissue engineering laboratory at the University of Illinois in Chicago, unveiled the new technique to delegates on the first day of the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in Washington.          Dr Mao, an associate professor, said the use of stem cells could reduce the amount of surgery patients had to go through and produce long-lasting natural implants that kept their shape.          'Saline implants are unnatural and can leak, rupture or interfere with breast cancer detection and the downside of surgeons harvesting soft tissue from other parts of the body is that it can shrink by up to 50 per cent,' he said.          'Stem cell-derived tissue could offer a better way forward for both reconstruction and augmentation surgery.           'This is the first study of its kind so we are still at an early stage, but after four weeks we found the stem cell-derived tissue maintained the shape and dimensions of the originally intended configuration.'          Dr Mao and his colleagues took a line of adult stem cells, the body's 'master' cells that can grow into different types of cells, from the bone marrow of a healthy volunteer. Growth factors were used to encourage them to become soft tissue cells. These were then placed in moulds containing a hydrogel liquid that gains a jelly-like consistency when exposed to ultra-violet light.          This substance was placed under the skin of immuno-deficient laboratory mice. Four weeks later, the remaining piece of soft tissue was removed and examined.          The researchers found the hydrogel had, as expected, degenerated and that the tissue retained the required original shape and dimensions. It was previously known that adult stem cells could be used to create replacement body parts such as jaw, knee or hip joints, and that hydrogel could be used to grow tissues other than soft, fatty tissues. But it is the first time the two techniques have been combined to create soft tissue.          At present natural implants often require surgery to take tissue from another location of a patient's body. Studies have shown conventional soft tissue implants can lose 40 to 60 per cent of their volume over time.          The stem cell approach does not require extensive surgery because the cells are obtained through a less invasive method.          Douglas McGeorge, the president elect of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said yesterday: 'The future lies in using bio-compatible tissue and this sounds like a step in the right direction.          'People have been working towards this for a long time for implants for head and neck injuries. If it works it will be of great use in reconstruction for patients who have suffered trauma, tumours or have congenital deformities.          'It means that you can have something that is part of the patient so you don't have to worry about using foreign bodies in the patient. It is part of them. It lives with them and will develop a blood supply with the patient and be protected by their own immune system.'"
telegraph,3/7/2013 18:00,news,"Patients suffering from liver failure could be injected with tiny replacement organs grown from their own stem cells within the next ten years following new research.Scientists have for the first time grown miniature precursors to human livers   known as liver buds using a combination of three different types of stem   cells. They have shown that by transplanting these tiny liver buds - which are   normally found in developing embryos in the womb – into mice, they then   matured into adult livers. The scientists behind the research now plan to develop the technique to   produce a new kind of treatment for liver patients that could help reduce   the need for donated organ transplants. They claim that by injecting thousands of microscopic liver buds into the   blood stream of patients they will become incorporated into their damaged   liver and restore its function. Professor Takanori Takebe, a stem cell biologist who led the work at Yokohama   City University in Japan, said work based in animals suggests they could   restore up to 30 per cent of a patient’s original liver function with the   technique, allowing them to live normal lives. Experts have greeted the research as a “huge step” towards producing off the   shelf livers that can be transplanted into patients. Around 700 liver transplants are carried out in the UK each year but around   100 patients die over the same period while on the waiting list due to a   shortage of organ donors. “We proved that liver bud transplantation could offer therapeutic potential   against liver failure,” said Professor Takebe. “This is a proof of principle   approach. “We’re now planning to transplant the liver buds into the liver. To do that we   have to reduce the size of the liver buds to a very small scale. That way   they can be injected into the blood stream. “I am optimistic that with a large infusion of several hundred of thousands of   liver buds, around 30 per cent of the patient’s original liver function   could be restored and that should be enough to restore a viable liver system   for that patient.” Professor Takebe and his colleagues combined in the laboratory three types of   human stem cells taken from bone marrow, blood vessels and reprogrammed skin   cells known as induced pluripotent stem cells.In their study, which is published in the journal Nature,   they claim the stem cells self-organised to form three-dimensional liver   buds in around six days. When these were transplanted into mice, the liver buds became incorporated   into the vascular system and began functioning as adult liver tissue. Previous attempts to grow livers from stem cells had failed to get them to   grow the blood vessels needed to make them function properly. Professor Malcolm Alison, a stem cell biologist at Queen Mary University of   London, said: “This study has made a major step forward in improving the effectiveness of   liver cell transplantation for treating acute liver failure. “Human mature liver cells transplanted on their own can fail to thrive, but if   immature liver cells are first combined with their normally nurturing   supportive cells they can mature in the transplanted host and function   efficiently. “This science opens up the distinct possibility of being able to create   mini-livers from the skin cells of a patient dying of liver failure, and   when transplanted would not be subjected to immune rejection as happens with   conventional liver transplants today.” The human liver plays an important role in metabolising drugs and sugar in the   blood. It also helps remove potentially harmful toxins from the blood stream.There is currently no way to compensate for the loss of liver function. While   the liver has a great capacity to repair itself, diseases such as hepatitis   or alcohol abuse can damage the liver.Professor Stuart Forbes, from the Centre for Regenerative Medicine at   University of Edinburgh, said: “Although exciting there is still a lot more   research needed before this approach could be applied to patients with liver   disease. “The liver buds were small and scaling up to a ‘human relevant size’ may be a   challenge, as will creating a true liver structure.” "
telegraph,21/07/2002 00:01,news,"Patients with angina are being asked to take part in the largest study of gene therapy in the hope that it will lead to a new treatment for Britain's two million sufferers.Specialists at Hammersmith Hospital in London have been given permission to inject a virus carrying a human gene into the hearts of 40 angina sufferers in the hope of relieving the breathlessness and pain they suffer.The hospital is the first in Britain to take part, but others are expected to join the international trial that will eventually involve 1,000 patients from across Europe and the United States.One man with severe angina has already undergone treatment and is said to have improved considerably, although it is not known whether he received the gene therapy or a dummy treatment being used as a comparison.For many angina sufferers even walking a short distance can prove impossible. The blood vessels of the heart are narrowed by fatty build-up, starving the organ of oxygen and damaging its ability to function efficiently.The therapy aims to rectify this by delivering a gene (known as FGF4) that stimulates the growth of new blood vessels to the heart muscle. The gene is contained in an inactive form of the common cold virus, an adenovirus, which is able to pass directly into the muscle cells.The British study has been approved by the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee which advises health ministers on the ethics and safety of gene therapy and vets proposals from scientists.Kevin Beatt, a consultant cardiologist at Hammersmith Hospital who is leading the study in Britain, said yesterday that the treatment would be offered to volunteers up to the age of 75 for whom other treatments such as a coronary artery bypass operation or angioplasty to open up blocked blood vessels were unsuitable.Dr Beatt said:'From what we have seen we are very optimistic that this research will help us develop a new treatment for severe angina which could dramatically improve the lives of those suffering from the disease.''We deliver the treatment into the arteries of the heart and, quite remarkably, virtually all of it gets into the heart muscle cells. The genetic material incorporated into the virus then modifies the structure of the cell and this in turn influences other cells nearby creating new blood vessels.'Successful gene therapy is the Holy Grail of medical research, but the search for genetic treatments has proved largely disappointing. The one notable exception is the case of 18-month-old Rhys Evans who was once confined to an isolation tent because he had a defective immune system but is now well after gene therapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital.Three years ago the field was thrown into disarray when an 18-year-old American died from an allergic reaction after being transfused with an adenovirus carrying a gene that doctors hoped would cure his rare liver complaint.A study of the new angina treatment, however, concluded that it was safe to use. Seventy-nine men and women with angina had the treatment in the American study without ill effect. The therapy is now being developed commercially by Collateral Therapeutics of California and Schering, the German pharmaceutical company.Dr Beatt said: 'As far as we can tell the therapy is safe. Because the viruses don't replicate they can't be infectious. There is, I suppose, some theoretical chance there could be a mutation but it is a billion to one.'As a precaution the treatment would take place in an isolation ward. Because there is a theoretical risk of promoting blood vessel growth in existing cancers, all volunteers would also be screened at the outset for malignancy, the doctor said.A spokesman for the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee said last night that it had approved the study after 'extensive consideration'. Researchers had been told that they must report any adverse reaction immediately."
telegraph,11/7/2007 0:01,news,"People who seem to stay younger for longer are also likely to have more moles, research released yesterday suggests.         A study of twins found a striking correlation between high numbers of moles and a biological marker for slow ageing.                                       As a result, people with a lot of moles might be expected to live longer than those who have very few, despite facing a greater risk of skin cancer.             Dr Veronique Bataille, from the Twin Research Unit at King's College London, who led the study said: 'The results are very exciting as they show, for the first time, that moley people who have a slightly increased risk of melanoma [skin cancer] may, on the other hand, have the benefit of a reduced rate of ageing.         'This could imply susceptibility to fewer age-related diseases such as heart disease or osteoporosis, for example. Further studies are needed.'         Moles appear in childhood and tend to vanish from middle age onwards. People with white skin average about 30 moles, although some may have as many as 400.         The reason for these differences is unknown, as is the function of moles. Previous research has shown that up to 60 per cent of susceptibility to moles is inherited.         Because moles disappear with age Dr Bataille's team looked at their relationship with telomere length, a good biological indicator of an individual's rate of ageing.         Telomeres are protective bundles of DNA found at the end of chromosomes in all cells. As cells divide, the telomeres shorten until a point where the chromosomes become unstable. The cell may then stop dividing or die.         The scientists compared more than 1,800 twins and found that participants with high numbers of moles - more than 100 - had longer telomeres than those with fewer than 25 moles.         The difference between the two groups was equivalent to six to seven years of normal ageing estimated by looking at the average rate of telomere length loss per year.         People with a lot of moles appeared to have longer telomeres and to keep their moles for longer. Those with shorter telomeres had fewer moles and tended to lose them more quickly with age.         Prof Tim Spector, head of the Twin Research Unit and co-author of the study published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention, said: 'We now plan to look in more detail at the genes which influence the numbers of moles and to see whether they may also slow down the ageing process.'"
telegraph,31/08/2004 00:01,news,"Professor John Clark, who has died aged 52, was an expert in animal science and biotechnology and the Director of the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, where he developed techniques for the genetic modification of livestock; this work paved the way for the birth, in 1996, of Dolly the sheep, the first animal to have been cloned from an adult.          In 1985 Clark joined what was then known as the Animal Breeding Research Organisation in Edinburgh where he was put in charge of a project to produce human proteins (which could be used in the treatment of human diseases) in sheep's milk. Clark and his team focused their study on the production of the alpha-I-antitrypsin protein, which is used for treatment of cystic fibrosis.          The production of human proteins in another animal's milk requires the ability to manipulate DNA and introduce human gene sequences into animal embryos. At the time, such genetic modification was a great technical challenge. Thus when, in 1990, Clark announced the birth of Tracy, the first sheep to produce large quantities of human protein in her milk, it was a significant milestone in the development of transgenic technologies. It also helped to establish the Roslin Institute as a leading centre for research in animal biotechnology.          During the 1990s Clark continued to develop cloning techniques and to work on the production of precise genetic changes in animals other than mice. He and his colleagues were the first to produce a large animal from which a specific gene had been removed (a prion protein gene from a sheep). Then in 1996, building on much of Clark's work, scientists at Roslin successfully transplanted the DNA of an adult sheep to an unfertilised egg cell which had been previously emptied of its own genetic material. The result was the birth of Dolly the sheep.          John Clark was born at Blackpool on September 18 1951, but was brought up in Lincolnshire. He was educated at Barton Grammar School, Lincolnshire, before going on to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he read Zoology. In 1975 he took an M Sc from the University of Western Ontario, where he studied development in the mud snail.          After a year spent travelling around America with his wife, Helen, Clark returned to Britain where he began working as a molecular biologist, completing a study on human satellite DNA for the Medical Research Council Clinical and Population Cytogenetics Unit in Edinburgh, by which he was awarded a PhD in 1982.          His first post-doctoral appointment was to study genes that function in the liver of mice with John Bishop in the Institute of Genetics, at Edinburgh University.          At the Roslin Institute Clark combined his work on the development of transgenic livestock with the establishment of the institute's research programme on human embryonic stem cells. His appointment as director of the institute in August 2003 was greeted with widespread approval.          At the time of his death he was working to derive liver cells and neurones from human embryonic stem cells for use in the testing of new drugs and in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, stroke and spinal cord injury.          Clark's considerable energy was combined with an entrepreneurial flair and he established three commercial companies - PPL Therapeutics, Rosgen and Roslin Biomed - based on the Roslin Institute's research. In 1999 Roslin Biomed was acquired by an American company, the Geron corporation, and it has since been at the forefront human stem cell research. PPL Therapeutics, which was set up in 1987, had recently been involved in the development of a wound sealant called Fibrin-1, but was forced into voluntary liquidation last year.          Clark was appointed OBE in 1997, and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1999. He also contributed to numerous scientific committees and working groups. He died on August 12.          Clark, who had a wide-circle of friends and enjoyed music, dancing and travel, was found dead at his holiday cottage in Berwickshire. He had recently been suffering from depression.          He is survived by his wife Helen, and their two sons."
telegraph,22/01/2001 00:00,news,"READERS will remember the dark eyes of ANDi, the world's first genetically modified monkey, gazing up at them from this newspaper recently.After several failed attempts to insert jellyfish genes into rhesus monkeys, ANDi - 'inserted DNA' in reverse - was created at the Oregon Regional Primate Research Center in America. ANDi's case has attracted worldwide interest because of its implications for the manufacture of 'designer babies': genetically modified humans, created from a shopping list of desirable characteristics. Other GM animals already exist, but the modification of primates brings the possibility of similar experiments on humans much closer.Ever since Aldous Huxley's Brave New World appeared nearly 70 years ago, thoughtful people have been haunted by his vision of a dystopian society of laboratory-bred human robots. Until the Nazis gave eugenics a bad name, many intellectuals in Britain and America supported the idea. Now the genetic revolution has made eugenics respectable again. Scientists at the cutting edge of genetic research are often invited to defend their work, but we hear less often from philosophers. Theirs, however, is the task of assessing the meaning of such research.The Telegraph asked seven of the world's leading philosophers a number of questions arising from the ANDi case. Is the genetic modification of animals in general, and primates in particular, morally justifiable? Will such research inevitably be extended to humans and, if so, would that be wrong? Should there be any ethical limitations on the use of such research for eugenic purposes, as opposed to purely medical ones? If animal species are genetically modified on a large scale, are there likely to be unforeseen consequences? Is such modification compatible with our duty as custodians of the animal kingdom?All these questions boil down to this: do we really know what we are doing and where it is leading? Experts disagree about the future as much as laymen. Philosophers, as Sir Michael Dummett points out, are not prophets. But it is clear that most of these thinkers find what Richard Rorty calls 'freaky experiments', such as ANDi, more or less disturbing.The main exception is John Harris, whose scientific background and role as a government adviser gives him a very different perspective. He welcomes a future in which humans may live for hundreds of years. At the other end of the spectrum, Roger Scruton is appalled by this prospect, while Leszek Kolakowski, who has first-hand experience of hi-tech barbarism in communist Eastern Europe, fears that a brave new world may be just around the corner.The two American professors, Noam Chomsky and Richard Rorty, are more reluctant to criticise scientists. Sir Michael Dummett has no qualms about the use of primates, but raises the important issue of inequality. Designer babies may be all very well for the rich, but there is little possibility of the vast majority of the world's population benefiting from such technology. Sir Michael will not be the only person to find the spectre of a genetically modified master race 'repugnant'.     Noam Chomsky Professor Noam Chomsky, 72, who teaches linguistics and philosophy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, has argued that children are born with an innate understanding of grammar. Professor Chomsky said: 'We are getting to the point where serious questions arise about tampering with the living world. We have to consider whether these genetic modifications are in a fact a form of torture for these animals.' 'There are two kinds of questions we have to ask. Firstly, is it something we can significantly benefit from? That is not something I feel qualified to answer. 'Secondly, is it possibly a step towards dealing with serious health problems for humans? I think it is and this kind of work should not be wiped out. But there should be more controls and serious evaluations. Giving a person an aspirin and giving them genetic modification are far different things. It's a matter of gradation. But I suppose we should remember that we had exactly the same fears about advanced medicines and psychotherapy.'     Michael Ball Professor Michael Ball, 62, a lecturer in medical cell biology, is chairman of Frame, the Fund for Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments, and an opponent of testing on animals. He said: 'The experiment on this monkey is obscene, ethically unjustified and scientifically unnecessary. It is time somebody called the bluff of these people every time they say they have made a new step forward. The idea that they can resolve every disease under the sun and make us live for 2,000 years is ridiculous. The extremely low rate of success in scientific terms does not justify the animal suffering involved. These primate centres in America are all looking for work to do to justify their existence.'     Sir Michael Dummett Professor Sir Michael Dummett, 75, former Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford University, said: 'I don't have any objections to using monkeys. They are animals - I don't think we should give them the vote. However, I don't think we should have an arrangement by which parents decide what children they want. That would not be a happy state of affairs because the rich would have magnificent babies and the poor would have to put up with what God sends. I'm not a prophet, but it goes without saying that some scientists are going to be able to do many repugnant things. We have to give that critical consideration.'     Leszek Kolakowski Professor Leszek Kolakowski, 73, is a leading philosopher at Oxford University who escaped from Poland in 1968 and whose writings contributed to the downfall of communism. He believes that today's big threat is biotechnology and genetic manipulation: 'I am afraid it will lead into experimentation on humans, not in civilised countries but in countries which are technically developed but not civilised, like China. I understand the medical reasons for such experiments. It is clear that genetic manipulation can be done on primates but what the capability of these hereditary changes are might well be impossible to predict. We could develop monsters. '     John Harris Professor John Harris, lecturer in bioethics at Manchester University, is a member of the Government's human genetics commission and author of Clones, Genes and Immortality. He said: 'There are two issues. The ethics of modifying genes of humans and the ethics of preparing the way to do that by using primates. We should be sparing on our use of primates because they are so very nearly persons themselves.' Professor Harris, 54, an atheist who has advocated that corpses should become public property to make up for the shortage in transplant organs, added: 'In a way, we are all genetically modified already. Evolution is a mechanism for genetic modification but it is not a particularly efficient one. We are already genetically modified creatures. If we can modify genes to protect ourselves from harm it is much better than leaving it to evolution. 'Evolution has done a very mixed job for humans. It has left a pool of diseases that have created untold misery. We may be able to engineer resistance to diseases that may have a big affect on life expectancy, allowing people to live hundreds of years longer. Of course, that is a long way in the future. I don't think there is anything wrong in principle with designer babies. If we can improve intelligence, that would cut out spending a huge amount of money on education.'     Richard Rorty Professor Richard Rorty, 69, is a leading American philosopher and lecture at Stanford University, California. He has been called the most controversial but accessible philosopher since Bertrand Russell and made his reputation with Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature. He said: 'All kinds of problems are going to emerge out of these experiments. I think you can write science fiction situations where all natural species are disappearing and are replaced by artificial species made to human tastes. But this is not a reason to stop research that has given us cures to viruses as well as the possibility of biological warfare. You can pass all kinds of laws in the absence of global legislation but I still expect all kinds of freaky experiments in the world. Lots of people are thinking as hard as they can about these issues and it's hard to put your finger on many of them. It's disturbing - but lots of change in science is disturbing.'     Roger Scruton Roger Scruton, 56, is Britain's best known writer on philosophy and a former professor at Birkbeck College, London, and Boston University. He said: 'It is perhaps unfair to draw the comparison with Dr Mengele of Auschwitz, but it is certainly true that the new breed of medical researchers proceeds as though any reference to moral absolutes, or to the sanctity of life, is merely a quaint survival of a discredited view of the human condition. I have this horrible vision of a future in which there are no young people any more, except those manufactured by the bionic geriatrics who control things; those who use all the resources of the Earth, including those that belong by right to future generations, to outstay their welcome on a planet whose resources they devote entirely to themselves.'

Under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (HFE) Bill any work involving the use of cloned embryonic stem cells will require the consent of its donor.           A group of 29 scientists including three Nobel prizewinners warned in a letter that the provision would deny them access to tissue banks which act as libraries of the genes that trigger the serious diseases they want to study.           Much of the tissue was collected before it became possible to clone embryos, meaning patients would not have been able to consent to their genetic material being used for work of this kind.          Seeking retrospective permission will not be possible as most of the tissue was donated anonymously.           'Such stem cell lines would be of great value in understanding how diseases develop, as well in the search for therapies,' the letter says.         The Government and some campaigners say patients who gave their cells for research might not have done so had they known the work involved use of embryos.           A spokesman for the Department of Health said: 'We consider express consent from a gamete or cell donor is necessary to reflect the special status of the human embryo.'         Dr Calum MacKellar, of the Scottish Council on Human Bioethics, said: 'For scientists to clone human embryos without the consent of cell donors, which contains the genetic material, would be completely unethical.           'It would be like creating an identical twin embryo of a person by using his or her cells without consent.           'A certain amount of humility is required from the scientists who have signed this letter.           'They need to realise that it is not because the research is acceptable to them that is it not extremely offensive to many patients and a large section of the UK general public.'           The rules will apply to the creation of part-human, part-animal embryos created by transferring a cell from a person into an animal egg which has had its DNA removed.           Scientists have recently been given permission to use this technique to create stem cells with the same genetic defects as those with a disease – giving them a powerful new tool for understanding the causes of illnesses and developing new therapies.           Lord Patel of Dunkeld, the chairman of the UK Stem Cell Network Steering Committee, has tabled an amendment to the HFE Bill - currently passing through Parliament - that would overturn the consent provision.

It comes just a year after Chinese scientists revealed they had successfully   introduced human genes into 300 dairy cows to produce milk with the same   properties as human breast milk.In the latest research, geneticists were able to introduce a gene which causes   lactose, the main sugar in dairy products, to break down into other types of   sugar that are more easily digestible by humans.People who are lactose intolerant lack the ability to digest milk properly and   can cause stomach problems in sufferers.The calf, which has been named Lucks by researchers, was born two months ago   and is expected to start producing low-lactose milk once it gives birth to   offspring itself at around 25 months old.The scientists behind the development hope to create herds of low-lactose cows   that would eventually produce new types of dairy products to be sold in   shops in between five to ten years time.Dr Zhou Huanmin, director of the Key State Laboratory for Bio-manufacturing at   the Inner Mongolia University where the cow was created, said: 'Ordinary   milk contains lactose, while milk produced by our modified cow will have   relatively low content of lactose, or even have no lactose.'Most people suffer the lactose intolerance in varying degree. We are   attempting to breed a dairy cow that produce low lactose milk for supplying   the market. We hope to commercialise it in the future.'In the UK around five per cent of people are lactose intolerant, but in some   parts of Africa and Asia up to 90 per cent of the population do not have the   ability to digest milk.To create the low lactose cow, the scientists injected genes from   bacteria-like organisms known as archaea into cells from cow embryos using   the technique used to clone Dolly the Sheep.They created 14 embryos and implanted them into the wombs of surrogate cows.   Five calves were born in April this year and three were found to carry the   genes needed to create low-lactose milk, although two of them died within 24   hours of birth.The scientists said Lucks, a modified Holstein dairy cow, was 'healthy   and strong'. They will conduct tests on her milk once she starts   lactating to assess exactly how much lactose the milk contains.In a separate study, published in the journal of Transgenic   Research, another group of scientists at the Inner Mongolia   University have created a genetically modified cow that has high levels of   omega-3 fatty acids in its milk.Normally found in fish oil and nuts, omega 3 fatty acids are thought to be   important for human health by helping to protect against heart disease and   playing a role in brain function.Dr Guang-Peng Li and his team at the Key Laboratory for Mammalian Reproductive   Biology and Biotechnology at the Inner Mongolia University, using cloning   technology to introduce a gene from roundworm into cow embryos.The genetically modified cow was then allowed to mature and give birth to its   own offspring before tests were conducted on its milk.The researchers found the milk contained nearly four times as much omega-3   fatty acids compared to milk from an ordinary cow. It also contained half   the amount of unhealthy omega-6 unsaturated fat, which have been linked to   cancer and heart disease.Dr Li explained that mammals do not naturally have the ability to make omega 3   fatty acids nor convert the less healthy omega 6 unsaturated fat into   healthier forms.He said: 'Our results indicate that transgenic domestic animals can   produce meat and milk enriched in n-3 fatty acids, which can probably become   an efficient and economical approach to meet the increasing demand for omega   three polyunsaturated fatty acids.'The research has, however, raised concerns from animal rights campaign groups   and critics of GM technology. Wendy Higgins, from the Humane Society International, said: 'This simply   isn't a morally responsible direction for farming to be heading in. 'Genetic modification of animals has an almost unique capacity to cause   suffering and the welfare impacts on the animals produced can be both   unpredictable and severe. 'The history of GM research tells us that the unseen cost will be animals   born with unexpected and lethal deformities such as tumours, brain defects,   deformed limbs and arthritis.'Dr Helen Wallace, director of Genewatch, added: 'There is a question of   food safety with GM livestock.'As with all GM technology, there is a potential for unintended   consequences as it is interfering with the natural biological production   pathways of milk, so it could effect other nutrients or even have harmful   effects.'"

Thett  study suggests that women continue to produce eggs aftertt  birth from special stem cells, which have been overlookedtt  until now. tt       The eggs derived from these cells also form newtt  follicles, where eggs ripen, which drive the production oftt  hormones. The project's leading author, Prof Jonathantt  Tilly, said yesterday: 'These are basic biologicaltt  findings that may change everything in our field. Althoughtt  there is no way to say how long it may take for thesett  findings to actually affect the care of patients, we arett  very excited.' tt       However, the study was done on mice and a leadingtt  figure in the field, Prof Roger Gosden, was cautious. tt       He welcomed the research, but said:tt  'Reproductive biology is very variable between speciestt  and, as yet, there is no evidence in humans contrary to thett  old dogma that egg production ceases before birth. tt       'If we have been wrong, I will bett  astounded.' tt       If today's findings hold in humans, 'alltt  theories about the ageing of the female reproductive systemtt  will have to be revisited,' said Prof Tilly. The studytt  raises the issue of whether such things as smoking,tt  chemotherapy and radiation could harm these stem cells andtt  prematurely age the ovary, he said. tt       Now the cells have been identified, ways to delaytt  ovarian ageing - and extend fertility - can be studied.tttt       Removing, storing and reimplanting these stemtt  cells could offer an alternative to storing mature eggs,tt  which is difficult, for fertility preservation in cancertt  patients. tt       The same approach could be used to delay thett  menopause. 'That is something we are very excitedtt  about,' said Prof Tilley. tt       The work also suggests that therapeutic cloning -tt  where stem cells are derived from an early cloned embryo -tt  could make eggs for infertile women, though Prof Tilly saidtt  this was difficult to achieve. tt       The team made the find by uncovering att  'dramatic inconsistency' in the numbers of dyingtt  eggs and the reserve of eggs in juvenile and adulttt  life. tt       Treating prepubertal female mice with a chemicaltt  known to kill stem cells caused ovarian failure by att  mechanism that did not involve destruction of eggs presenttt  at the start of the treatment. tt       Examination of ovaries of young and mature micett  identified cells on the organs' outer surface thattt  resembled cells which are the source of eggs in foetaltt  animals - now recognised as stem cells. tt       The team showed that new egg cells develop andtt  form follicles in ovarian tissue in genetically alteredtt  mice. tt       If the work applies to women, it may explain whytt  fertility declines after 30: that this might be due tott  depletion of stem cells, rather than exhaustion of an eggtt  reserve laid down before birth. tt       The team is trying to isolate and store the stemtt  cells in mice so they can investigate how to preventtt  ovarian failure and infertility caused by ageing or cancertt  treatments, with a view to applying this research tott  women. tt       Charlotte Woodhouse went through the menopause attt  the age of 14 and pins her hopes of raising a family on att  breakthrough in research. tt       For the past few years the thought of a scientifictt  advance that could help delay or even reverse the menopausett  has brought comfort to the 23-year-old, who lives in Biggintt  Hill, Kent. tt       In her case, the new understanding of stem cellstt  would have to be combined with therapeutic cloning, att  contentious method under development that is more hope thantt  real substance. tt       No matter how experimental, she hopes the work cantt  help all women in her predicament.

telegraph,24/06/2012 07:10,news,"Scientists have discovered that hair follicles in people who are balding are trapped in a 'sleeping' state and are now developing a new treatment to combat baldness. It sounds more like an explanation that would be used by nursery children than   respected scientists, but researchers have found that rather than losing   their hair altogether, people who are going bald are suffering from 'sleeping'   hair follicles. Trichologists have discovered that hair follicles on the scalp can become   trapped in a resting state where they do not grow new hair, leading to   thinning. They now claim to have identified a way of waking the follicles up again to   help restore a fuller head of hair to people who are going bald. Unfortunately they may not be able to delay the balding process forever, as   eventually the hair follicles lose the ability to make new hair, but for   those who are starting to get a bit thin on top, it may help stave of the   need for embarrassing wigs, comb overs or hair transplants. Dr Bruno Bernard, head of hair biology at L'Oreal in Paris who carried out the   research, has now announced that the company are developing a new treatment   that can be applied to the scalp in a shampoo or cream to help encourage   hair to grow again. He said: 'Hair follicles exist in two stable states – either an active   state or a dormant state. From time to time, they will jump from one state   to another. 'Some of the follicles are just resting in the dormant state and are   waiting for the right signal to make new hair. They are in a latency period.   If you can reduce this latency period, you will have more hair. 'We have identified a compound and we are going to make a formulation of   it that can be applied to the scalp to wake the follicle up from its   sleeping state to the active state.' Up to half of all men suffer from androgenic alopecia, the most common cause   of hair loss and thinning in humans. It is estimated that around eight   million women in the UK also suffer excessive hair loss to some degree. Typically hair strands grow continually for a period of up to four years   before the follicles switch to a dormant state and the strand of hair falls   out. During this dormant period, stem cells in the skin begin the processes   needed to grow new hair. In people who are going bald, however, this process can stall and new hair   does not form. Scientists working with Dr Bernard at L'Oreal believe they have identified why   this happens. They have found two reservoirs of stem cells help are   responsible for creating new hair, one that is near the surface of the skin   and one that is deeper in the layers of the skin. The bottom reservoir of stem cells, called CD34+ cells, are in an environment   that is low in oxygen, known as hypoxia, which helps to keep the stem cells   in a healthy condition. Dr Bernard, who presented the findings at the European Hair Research society   in Barcelona, said that in people who are going bald, the levels of oxygen   around these stem cells have changed, meaning they work less efficiently and   so preventing the creating of new hair. 'The stem cells can sense the amount of oxygen around them,' he   said. 'We have identified molecules that mimic the effect of hypoxia on   the stem cells. It means we can push the empty hair follicles to make new   hair fibres faster.' "
telegraph,20/08/2011 12:47,news,"Scientists have discovered the origin of the kangaroo's hop after sequencing the genome of a type of wallaby. The project is the first time the genome of a species belonging to the   kangaroo family has been sequenced. It has allowed researchers to pinpoint a cluster of genes they believe are   responsible for the animals' unusual form of locomotion. The tammar wallaby genome, which is published in the journal of Genome   Biology, will also provide scientists with the ability to study a   key point in mammalian evolution. Marsupials and placental animals, which include humans, diverged from a common   ancestor around 180 million years ago. By comparing the wallaby genome with those of placental mammals, the   scientists have been able to identify several groups of genes that are   unique to marsupials. The tammar genome contains one of the largest families of genes required for   detecting smell compared to other mammals. The scientists found it has more   than 1,500 genes responsible for detecting smells. It suggests the tammar wallaby can detect a wide range of odours, which might   help explain how the tiny bean-sized newborn wallaby can navigate it's way   through its mother's fur to her pouch where it remains for nine months as it   grows. 'The tammar wallaby sequencing project has provided us with many   possibilities for understanding how marsupials are so different to us,'   explained Professor Marilyn Renfree, from the University of Melbourne, who   was one of the lead researchers on the project. The rabbit-sized tammar wallaby is the third marsupial to have its genome   sequenced, after the grey short-tailed opossum and the endangered Tasmanian   devil. The project was conducted by an international consortium of scientists from   Australia, USA, Japan, the UK and Germany. The researchers have identified cluster of genes called HOX are key to the   development of the animals' enlarged, powerful hind-legs and its distinctive   hop, which is common among members of the kangaroo family. Dr Elizabeth Murchison, a marsupial specialist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger   Institute in Cambridge, UK, described the study as 'an impressive piece   of work looking at one of Australia's iconic species.' Speaking to BBC News, she said: 'It's always really valuable to look at   an organism that is a bit different to understand how humans and other   mammals have evolved. 'It gives you a perspective on mammalian evolution by looking at mammals   that have diverged fairly early on, like the kangaroo.' "
telegraph,15/03/2004 00:01,news,"Scientists have found the cells that are the source of follicles and hair growth, a discovery that will energise research into treatments for thinning hair and baldness.          An American team reported yesterday that it had become the first to isolate parent cells - stem cells - in mouse hair follicles that can regenerate hair, skin and follicles after being implanted into the skin of mice.          Crucially, the cells were from adult mice, which normally do not form new hair follicles. The same holds true for humans - no new hair follicles form after we are born.          Dr George Cotsarelis of the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre, Philadelphia, and colleagues say in the journal Nature Biotechnology that, by focusing treatments on these cells, advances should be made in treating a wide range of conditions, not just hair loss but wounding, burns and skin cancers too.          'Now that we can isolate stem cells involved in hair growth, we can develop targets for manipulating hair growth,' says Dr Cotsarelis.          Researchers hope to be able one day to isolate stem cells in an adult scalp and transplant those cells to other areas of the scalp, generating new follicles and hair growth.          Scientists have suspected that hair follicles contain stem cells. The new work uses sophisticated cell labelling methods in genetically altered mice to isolate these cells and proves conclusively that they do. The stem cells develop into all the mature cell types of the hair follicle.          Dr Cotsarelis said that using stem cell transplant as a treatment for hair loss is at least five to 10 years away. His team is now studying whether the genes that control hair growth in mice are also present in humans.          The findings have implications not only for hair growth but also for treatments for burns. 'The cells that we have isolated not only make hair follicles but also can make other skin cells,' said Dr Cotsarelis.          Hair grows from cells located at the base of the hair follicle, in an area called the bulb. Hair follicles continuously cycle through growth, rest, and re-growth phases.         In many people with hair loss, however, the follicles do not cycle correctly, with a growing number of follicles entering a resting phase."
telegraph,11/1/2007 0:01,news,"Scientists have taken another important step towards understanding how to turn skin and other adult cells into stem cells, the Holy Grail of this field because it would sidestep the troubling ethical issues surrounding the use of embryos.           Stem cell research is the subject of intense research worldwide because these cells have the potential to develop into 200 plus different cell types found in the body and could be used for a vast range of treatments, from heart to brain disease.           But while some scientists want to use cells from tiny week-old cloned embryos to avoid problems of rejection, and because the cells are so flexible, there is an intense search for alternatives because of pressure from the pro-life lobby, the opposition of President George W Bush and ethical concerns, even if they are used in life saving treatments.           Today a Cambridge University team announces that it has found the precise stage at which cells in the newly fertilised egg become stem cells, as opposed to the cells that form the placenta.           The findings of the study, which overturn the long-held belief that cells are the same until there are at least 16 cells in the embryo, are reported in today's edition of Nature.           Prof Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz reports that differences between the embryonic cells are already apparent in many embryos at the four-cell-stage, 'much earlier than supposed'. And those differences depend on the orientation and timing of the cell-divisions that occur before this stage.           The study also found cell fate is determined by the level of a modified form of histone H3, one of the basic proteins around which DNA is packaged, which affects the way genes are turned on and off.           The higher the levels of this modified form of histone H3, linked to levels of an enzyme called Carm1 methyltransferase, the more predisposed the embryonic cells were to develop the qualities of stem-cells. This marks the earliest signal found so far of when a cell is fated to become a stem cell.           This understanding could help efforts to find ways to 'de differentiate' cells, so that skin cells could be returned to an embryonic state so they could be grown into cell types suitable for treatments and raise no ethical concerns.           Today's work will augment another study, published last year in the journal Cell, which raised the first real hope that embryo-free and cloning-free methods can wind back the developmental clock of a patient's cell so that it can recover the full potential of an embryonic stem cell. After a heart attack, for example, skin cells from a patient might be turned into muscle cells to repair the cardiac damage.           Prof Shinya Yamanaka, from Kyoto University, found a way to turn ordinary mouse cells into 'pluripotent' cells with the potential ability to become any kind of body tissue. Remarkably, the switch was achieved using only four genes - Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4 - of the thousands that play a role in the development of early embryos.           Planted into adult connective tissue cells in the laboratory, the genes caused the cells to rejuvenate to an embryonic-like state. When the altered cells were placed under the skin of mice, they produced tumours containing the three primary types of tissue. Some of the cells were also incorporated into tissues when introduced into early mouse embryos.           Prof Yamanaka said it was still not known if the four genes could generate pluripotent cells from adult human cells. He warned that one of the genes they used, c-Myc, was implicated in many human cancers. And it is not clear whether the resulting rejuvenated cells, called 'induced pluripotent stem cells' can do everything that embryonic stem cells can. But, with the Cambridge work, the Holy Grail is at last in sight."
telegraph,2/8/2001 0:00,news,"SCIENTISTS have used stem cells from a human foetus to restore movement to paralysed animals, bringing closer the day when the tissue could be used to cure a range of human diseases.The experiment is the first time that human embryonic stem cells have been successfully used for a medical treatment. The research team at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, believes that similar experiments could be carried out on people within three years.The House of Lords opened the door to research on human stem cells for medical research earlier this year. These 'master cells' are valuable to scientists because they have yet to specialise into a particular type of tissue and can be cultured indefinitely in a laboratory.In theory, a few stem cells taken from an embryo could be used to create an unlimited supply of skin, liver, nerve, bone marrow or muscle cell. Nerve cells could be used to treat Parkinson's disease, while muscle cells could be used to patch up failing hearts. President Bush is facing a difficult decision over whether to permit public funded research into human embryo stem cells.The Baltimore team treated 120 mice and rats, which had been infected with a virus leaving them paralysed. The damaged nerves in their spines produced symptoms similar to motor neurone disease. The team then injected embryonic stem cells from aborted human foetuses into the animals' spinal fluid.Dr Douglas Kerr, a neurologist who led the research, found that the stem cells migrated to the damaged nerves and helped to regenerate them. 'The majority of the animals recovered some function. They can begin to move their hind limbs under them and some can bear weight.'"
telegraph,17/08/2000 00:00,news,"SCIENTISTS should be permitted to clone human embryos for experiments aimed at finding revolutionary treatment for problem diseases, the Government announced yesterday.Peers and MPs will be given a free vote later this year on whether to relax the law in line with the recommendations of an expert group headed by Prof Liam Donaldson, the Government's Chief Medical Officer.Ministers hope that the measures will lead to the development of treatments using stem cells, embryonic cells that have the ability to develop into any desired type, from nerve to liver and muscle. Prof Donaldson said: 'Stem cell research opens up a new medical frontier.'It offers enormous potential for new treatments for chronic disease, injuries, and the relief of human suffering.' He listed stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, common cancers, and injuries such as those to the spinal cord.But the momentous proposal to allow limited human cloning was greeted with dismay by pro-life and religious groups. They said there were alternatives to embryonic stem cells and condemned the proposals as shocking, immoral and unnatural. Scientists were now on a 'slippery slope' to cloning people.In response to widespread disquiet, the Government promised legislation to outlaw reproductive cloning, the creation of duplicate human beings. Although this is effectively banned under existing rules, it is not specifically outlawed.The proposals were welcomed by organisations representing doctors, patients and scientists, who hailed them as a far sighted move towards 'a new kind of medicine'. A spokesman for one medical charity, the Special Parkinson's Research Interest Group, said the fears of the pro-life lobby had to be weighed against the interests of patients 'whose daily lives are dominated by the struggle to cope with crippling conditions'.The proposals call for an extension of research on embryos from IVF (fertilisation of an egg with sperm in the laboratory), and for work on embryos created by 'therapeutic cloning', both up to the 14-day limit, or the appearance of the 'primitive streak', when the nervous system appears.Lord Winston, the test-tube baby pioneer and a leading member of the pro-lobby, said yesterday that 'we are going to have a fight'. He was responding to comments by the Tory health spokesman, Dr Liam Fox, who attacked the proposals as 'the extension of an already unacceptable position' and will vote against them.Dr Fox was, in turn, called the spokesman of 'an extreme anti-abortion fundamentalist Right-wing party' by Dr Evan Harris, the Liberal Democrat science spokesman. Dr Harris criticised the Government for dragging its feet so that patients with degenerative disease have to wait even longer for new treatments.These are the opening shots of a row that is likely to return to the issue of whether any research should be performed on human embryos, which was hotly debated before the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.After balancing ethical considerations against benefits, Prof Donaldson's committee concluded that the range of research should be broadened to stem-cell studies to treat disease and disorders. The group concluded that 'the proposed new research did not raise fundamentally new ethical issues, different from those raised by currently permitted forms of embryo research'.Critics say the use of embryonic cells is unnecessary: recent studies in America, Sweden and elsewhere have shown that stem cells can be isolated from umbilical cord blood, adult tissue, such as bone marrow, and from an aborted foetus.Prof Donaldson said researchers have to study many issues before stem cells can be used to treat illness. Scientists must confirm that cells made by cloning would develop normally, check whether they age more rapidly and screen for unpredictable mutations and tumours.He said 'we are very well served' by existing safeguards in the 1990 Act, which provide a framework for the new proposals. 'We have the most tightly regulated system in the world.' He added that the recommendations focus on research, not treatment, and legislation would have to be re-examined when treatments based on stem cells emerge."
telegraph,27/05/2013 13:04,news,"Seriously disabled stroke sufferers surprised doctors by regaining movement in their hands and legs after receiving a pioneering new treatment where stem cells are injected into the brain. It had been thought that patients could not make any recovery more than six   months after a stroke. However, five out of nine stroke victims who took part in preliminary clinical   trials of the new stem cell procedure showed mild to moderate improvements. Some of the patients were able to move their fingers again after several years   of complete paralysis, while others found that they could walk around their   houses by themselves without assistance. Professor Keith Muir, of Glasgow University, who is carrying out the research,   said the results had confounded his expectation that he would see very   little change and certainly no sustained recovery. He stressed that it was too early to tell whether the effect was caused by the   new treatment, which involves injecting stem cells directly into the damaged   parts of stroke sufferers’ brains with the hope that they will turn into   healthy tissue or 'kick-start' the body's own repair processes. The studies so far have not been able to rule out completely the possibility   that the patients benefited from the “placebo effect” of receiving close   medical attention. However, Prof Muir told the BBC: 'It seems odd that it should all just be   chance and a placebo effect. We are seeing things that are interesting and   somewhat surprising.”He added: 'My expectation had been that we would see very little change and if   we did see change it would be a relatively short-lived temporary change.   [But] we have seen changes that have been maintained over time.”The patients in the study, which took place at Glasgow's Southern General   Hospital, were aged in their 60s, 70s and 80s, and all had suffered their   stroke between six months and five years earlier. Frank Marsh, 80, a retired teacher, was once a keen piano player, but a stroke   five years ago left him with poor strength and co-ordination in his left   hand. Describing the improvement he experienced after receiving the stem cell   treatment, he told the BBC: 'I can grip certain things that I never gripped   before, like the hand rail at the baths, with my left hand as well as my   right.'It still feels fairly weak and it's still a wee bit difficult to co-ordinate   but it's much better than it was.'He added: 'I'd like to get back to my piano. I'd like to walk a bit steadier   and further.'The small-scale study, whose results will be presented to the European Stroke   Conference in London tomorrow, is the world’s first clinical trial examining   the safety of neural stem cell treatment in stroke patients. The first phase of the research was carried out to check that the procedure is   safe. Now Prof Muir and his team are planning a larger phase two trial later   this year to explore further how effective the treatment is. Dr Clare Walton, from the Stroke Association said: “The use of stem cells is a   promising technique which could help to reverse some of the disabling   effects of stroke.  “We are very excited about this trial. However, we are currently at the   beginning of a very long road and significant further development is needed   before stem cell therapy can be regarded as a possible treatment.”"

Confining meals to a 12 hour window, such as 8am to 8pm, and fasting for the   remaining day, appears to make a huge difference to whether fat is stored,   or burned up by the body. Researchers at The Salk Institute in the US, said it adds more evidence to   studies which show that eating late at night causes weight gain. They suggest restricting eating hours could help fight high cholesterol,   diabetes and obesity. 'These days, most of the advice is, 'You have to change nutrition, you   have to eat a healthy diet,'' said associate professor Satchidananda   Panda rt        rt        rtt'But many people don't have access to healthy diets. So the question is,   without access to a healthy diet, can they still practice time-restricted   feeding and reap some benefit?'The researchers studied 400 mice, ranging from normal to obese who were placed   on various types of diets and lengths of time restrictions. They showed that mice which were fed a high-fat diet, but allowed access to   food for only 12 hours per day, were healthier and slimmer than mice given   access to the same food for the whole day, even though the two groups   consumed the same number of calories. The results were the same even if the diets were high fat, high sugar, or high   fruit sugars. The study also suggests that the odd blip is unlikely to make a difference. A   late night weekend takeaway, for example, is unlikely to harm the body's   metabolism. However regularly eating at night would have a big impact. 'The fact that it worked no matter what the diet, and the fact that it   worked over the weekend and weekdays, was a very nice surprise,' says   the study's first author Amandine Chaix, a postdoctoral researcher in Prof   Panda's lab. Mice who had become obese by eating whenever they liked during the day, lost   five per cent of their bodyweight, when put on restricted within just a few   days. At the end 38 week study, they were 25 per cent lighter than the group   who had continued to eat freely. Although mice on a healthy diet did not lose more weight, they gained muscle   mass, the study which was published in the journal Cell Metabolism showed. 'It's an interesting observation that although the mice on a normal diet   did not lose weight, they changed their body composition,' added Prof   Panda. 'That brings up the question--what happens? Are these mice maintaining   their muscle mass which might have been lost with free feeding, or are they   gaining muscle mass?' A second study found that sticking to a Mediterranean diet can protect the DNA   from ageing. Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) in the US found that a diet   high in olive oil, fresh fruit and vegetables and nuts, was associated with   longer telomeres. Telomeres are the protective caps which sit at the end of chromosomes and   prevent damage to the DNA, much like the plastic caps on the end of   shoelaces.Previous studies have shown that short telomeres are associated with disease   and advanced ageing. 'To our knowledge this is the largest population-based study specifically   addressing the association between Mediterranean diet adherence and telomere   length in healthy, middle-aged women,' explained Immaculata De Vivo,   PhD, MPH, an associate professor in the Channing Division of Network   Medicine at BWH and Harvard School of Public Health and senior author of   this study. 'Our results further support the benefits of adherence to this diet to   promote health and longevity.' Dr Mike Knapton, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation,   said: “This large study adds to the body of evidence that longer telomeres   are found in those who eat a Mediterranean diet. “Longer telomeres may partially explain the link between diet and risk of   cardiovascular disease. “Previous findings from the same study had shown that those with unhealthy   lifestyles had shorter telomeres. “These results reinforce our advice that eating a balanced and healthy diet   can reduce your risk of developing heart disease.”The study was published in the British Medical Journal.

Using stem cells from tissue donors, surgeons grew the cells in the laboratory before transplanting them onto the patients' eyes.         Dr Julie Daniels, who is leading the research team, will present the results at a conference on regenerative medicine being held in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, today.         She said: 'Before the surgery the patients were barely able to recognise when someone was waving a hand in front of their face but we have restored their vision to the point they can read three to four lines down the eye chart.'         Nineteen patients have now received the treatment, known as limbal stem cell therapy, at Moorfields Eye Hospital.         The patients were chemical burn victims or sufferers of a rare genetic disease known as aniridia. They had injuries to the limbal cells in their eyes, which are under the eye lid and maintain the transparent layer on the outside of the cornea.         Dr Daniels said: 'Their cornea becomes opaque, blood vessels grow across it and their eyes become inflamed and they can't see anymore. It is very painful.         'By replacing the limbal stem cells, the cornea begins to clear up as the cells are replaced with the healthy transparent layer again.         'We can't restore sight completely yet as the material we are growing the stem cells on is slightly opaque, but patients are certainly reporting an improvement.'         Ten patients were given the transplant 32 months ago and six of those have showed remarkable recovery. The remaining nine patients were treated eight months ago and are still to have their recovery assessed.         Scientists at Moorfields Eye Hospital are also hoping to use stem cells to treat other causes of blindness by creating small patches of retina cells, which detect light at the back of the eye.         The Royal National Institute for the Blind  (RNIB) welcomed the results of the limbal cell trial.         Barbara McLaughlin, campaigns manager at RNIB, said: 'Anything that can restore sight to people who thought they had irretrievably lost their eyesight is a major step forward.         'This research is very exciting, but we would caution that these treatments can take a significant amount of time and research before they can be widely used.'         More than 250,000 people suffer injuries to their eyes every year as a result of accidents, although only a small proportion of these are due to burns."
telegraph,27/01/2010 18:00,news,"Skin cells have been turned directly into nerve cells in research that could be a 'huge leap forward' for the treatment of dementia. Scientists used just three genes to make the identity switch, which was   achieved without an in-between stem cell stage. The breakthrough could 'revolutionise the future of human stem cell   therapy' for the regeneration of brains, said the researchers. In the past, normal cells have been coaxed into changing function by first   turning them into 'induced' stem cells. These have similar properties to stem cells taken from embryos, giving them   the potential to become any kind of tissue in the body. The new research went a step further by transforming mouse skin cells straight   into functional neurons, while by-passing the stem cell process. Dr Marius Wernig, who co-led the team from Stanford University School of   Medicine in California, said: 'We actively and directly induced one   cell type to become a completely different cell type. 'These are fully functional neurons. They can do all the principal things   that neurons in the brain do.'In the laboratory dish, the cells were seen to signal and make connections   with other nerve cells. Such functions are critical to future treatments for   Parkinson's disease and other brain disorders. The change happened within one week with an efficiency of almost 20 per cent. The scientists, whose research is published in the journal Nature, now hope to   duplicate the feat with human cells. Dr Irving Weissman, director of Stanford's Institute for Stem Cell Biology and   Regenerative Medicine, said: 'This study is a huge leap forward. The   direct reprogramming of these adult skin cells into brain cells that can   show complex, appropriate behaviours like generating electrical currents and   forming synapses establishes a new method to study normal and disordered   brain cell function. 'Finally we may be able to capture and study conditions like Parkinson's   or Alzheimer's or heritable mental diseases in the laboratory dish for the   first time.'In 2007, researchers announced the creation of iPS cells from human skin cells   by exposing them to proteins called transcription factors that influence   DNA. Once in a stem cell-state, a cocktail of chemicals was used to make the cells   develop into a new cell type. Later, scientists from Harvard University in the US showed that mouse pancreas   cells could be reprogrammed by infecting them with viruses carrying genes   for just three transcription factors. Dr Wernig's team used a similar technique, but dispensed with the iPS 'pit   stop'. The scientists began with a selection of 19 genes involved in either genetic   reprogramming or neural development and function. A virus was used to introduce the genes to mouse embryo skin cells, which were   then monitored. After 32 days, some of the former skin cells had acquired the appearance of   nerve cells and were producing neural proteins. The process was used to whittle the original 19 genes down to just three,   which were then tested on skin cells from the tails of adult mice. About 20 per cent of the former skin cells transformed themselves into neural   cells in less than a week. In comparison, it can take weeks to change a   cell's identity using the iPS method, with a success rate of just 1% to 2%. 'We were very surprised by both the timing and the efficiency,' said   Dr Wernig. 'This is much more straightforward than going through iPS   cells, and it's likely to be a very viable alternative.'The ability to make neurons quickly from an individual patient may one day   lead to the manufacture of cells for therapy, the scientists believe.

telegraph,27/06/2000 00:00,comment,"SO you can now download from the internet the complete instructions for building a (typical) human being. The completion of the rough draft of the human genome is more than just a medical revelation and an ethical earthquake. It is also a milestone in natural philosophy: a chance to deepen human self-understanding.Until now we have been like somebody exploring the outside of a cathedral in the dark with a torch. We could see only glimpses of the lowest stones. Now suddenly the floodlights are on. It will take many years to explore, but at least we can see it all. To switch to a more appropriate ecclesiastical metaphor, the human genome is literally a sort of digital text.It contains some 30,000-100,000 separate stories, known as genes, which is about as many as there are verses in the Bible. Each gene can be studied in immense depth by scores of researchers all over the world to discover how it can change to cause disease, where it came from, what it does in the body and how it is controlled. Imagine doing so for every verse in the Bible and you will get some idea of the sheer immensity of the task ahead of biology in the years to come.Moreover, the number of genes underestimates our complexity. Because of something called 'alternative splicing', different parts of a gene can be mixed together in various ways. One gene discovered last week seems able to produce up to 38,000 different versions of a protein to help guide the development of the brain. These big numbers matter because they correct the impression that the reading of the genome is the end of a simple story.To date, by finding single genes and linking them to simple effects, we have been misleading ourselves. One gene (CFTR) causes cystic fibrosis, another (APOE) can predispose you to Alzheimer's disease; a third (ACE) affects your athletic talent; a fourth (D4DR) seems to influence your personality. Therefore, the future of medicine seems a simple matter of testing your genes and taking appropriate preventive action to head off diseases and disorders.The future of reproduction also seems simple: people will pick from a menu of genes, by embryo screening initially, and by genetic engineering later, to ensure that their children are of the preferred sex, height, eye colour, health and musical ability. There is a germ of truth in all this. The future of medicine may indeed include predictive diagnosis based on genetics - you could have your medical horoscope told at intervals through your life with an accuracy that, though far from perfect, would be infinitely better than anything an astrologer could offer.Some people may well choose to influence the characteristics of their unborn children by peeking into their genes and even changing them (though this remains for now strictly outside the law and the agreed limits scientists place on themselves). But these are the concerns and obsessions of yesterday, of an era when we knew about a small number of genes. Once we know about the impact of tens of thousands of genes, the complexity of genetic diagnosis will grow.So, too, will the complexity of choosing designer babies. You might be confronted with a list of a thousand genes that will affect your future child's personality in one direction, and a thousand that will affect it in another. They will all interact in unpredictable ways, and they will each depend on the environmental background - the womb, the school, the weather. Suddenly, designer babies do not seem so easy after all.Ironically, this is exactly why we must be careful not to rush into heavy-handed legislation. It is fashionable to argue that, left to their own devices, people would hasten to have designer babies and this would have disastrous consequences for society. After all, in pursuit of the perfect human being, we have willingly tried every weapon that falls into our hands, from prayer to psychoanalysis to breast implants. Will we - and should we - do the same with genes?I think on the whole we won't, but it will not matter much if a few people do. Deluged in options by tens of thousands of different genetic possibilities, many of which are slight and uncertain, most people will choose not to fiddle with their future children's genes. After all, it would involve painful and risky in-vitro fertilisation. Even those with severe inherited diseases could choose pre-implantation genetic diagnosis instead of genetic modification.But would it matter if a few eccentric millionaires chose blue eyes or a low cancer risk or even high IQ for their children? Does it matter that a few people already try desperately to have a boy after a string of girls, or vice versa? If they succeed, the benefit is individual, but the cost to society is minimal. This is the opposite of the policy of eugenics as practised by many states in the first half of the last century.Eugenics - which mostly took the form of the sterilisation of the 'feeble minded' - was a form of nationalisation of reproductive decisions for the sake of society. Its costs were borne by individuals. If there is an individual today who wishes to correct a simple genetic defect in his or her own lineage because it has made his or her own life less enjoyable - a tendency to obesity, say, or dyslexia - then to give the state the right to stop them would be to repeat the mistakes of eugenics by putting society's interest before the individual's.For these reasons I refuse to be fashionably pessimistic and censorious about the possibility of designer babies. I refuse also to be pessimistic about the impact of genetic knowledge on insurance and employment. This raises issues of equity and privacy that are challenging, but they are not insuperable. Nor do I agree that reading the genome is trespassing on nature (or God's terrain) with Faustian hubris.Vaccination, antibiotics and surgery are all 'unnatural', yet they may all three have saved my life at least once, so I see no reason to lecture the medical profession on the ethics of not letting nature take its course. The possibility of using the new genomic knowledge to extend the human lifespan is probably the most intriguing dilemma. It will undoubtedly work. Genes are in control of ageing, which is now recognised as just a form of planned obsolescence allowed to run its course at different rates in different species.In both fruit flies and mice, it has proved possible to extend lifespan by altering the genes either through selective breeding or through genetic engineering. Human beings are 93 per cent mice at the genetic level, so we, too, could almost certainly be given doubled lifespans, presumably with later puberty, later menopause and later greying. The reading of the entire genome will make it much easier to identify which genes to fiddle with to achieve this result.But would anybody really want to be the first to try it? However much we may want to delay marriage and child bearing, I doubt that many of us would really dare visit such a fate on our children - which is how it would have to be done. The consequences for pensions, hospitals and even schools (10-year-olds as small and mentally undeveloped as six-year-olds?) are mind-boggling. Yet they are in practice a paper tiger, small and distant as both a threat and a promise.For these reasons, the great significance of the genome completion lies not in science-fiction futures, but in improving mundane features of life. The chief practical repercussion of yesterday's announcement over the next decade or two will not be GM people, or immortality, or the collapse of the insurance industry. It will be a dramatic acceleration of normal medicine. The genome gives us great possibilities for better understanding of how things work inside us.Better understanding leads to better cures and preventions. We will soon realise how primitive were our medical tools until now. The diseases that are getting commoner in modern society - cancer, asthma, depression - will be the ones that yield most to this new understanding. Yesterday's announcement was good news."
telegraph,22/12/2006 00:01,news,"Stem cell scientists have for the first time been given permission to ask donors to give their eggs for research even if they are not already having medical treatment.          The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has amended a previously granted licence to allow Prof Alison Murdoch, from the Centre for Life, Newcastle, to seek 'altruistic' donors.          Prof Murdoch wants to use human eggs to create embryonic stem cells — the body's basic building blocks that can grow into all other types of cells — carrying the defects responsible for diseases such as spinal muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.          This would allow researchers to understand how specific genetic defects cause illness and provide essential material for testing new treatments.          The goal for scientists is to create patient-specific stem cells that could be used to grow new tissue — such as liver, heart and muscle cells — that could be transplanted without the risk of rejection.          Prof Murdoch's team was awarded a temporary licence this year to offer discounted IVF treatment if patients donated eggs for research.          Yesterday it emerged that last month she had also been granted Britain's first licence to begin recruiting female donors who are not already having medical treatment.          The announcement proved contentious because the HFEA carried out a public consultation on egg donation that did not end until this month and the fertility clinic and research regulator is due to formulate new policies on the subject in February.          Dr Stephen Minger, a leading stem cell researcher from King's College London, said: 'Although I support this research, I am flabbergasted that the licence was given before the consultation process was completed. It seems very improper. What is the point in having a consultation?          'We are concerned that the current state of the technology means hundreds of eggs from young women will be required to generate a single human embryonic stem cell line.'          Dr Minger is awaiting a decision on his application to be allowed to create embryos that are 99.9 per cent human and 0.1 per cent animal as a means of producing embryonic stem cells for research without using human eggs.          Prof Murdoch, who has not started recruiting donors because she is waiting to hear if her research will receive funding, said: 'It's probably very unlikely that we will get many women coming forward, because of the procedures that are involved and the potential risks.          'But I believe very firmly in women's choice and if we give these women full info about what the research is about, and about the risks they incur in participating in this research, I think we should take their decision as it stands.'          The HFEA said the permission could be revoked in February following the development of clear policies after the public consultation.          A spokesman said: 'The decision to allow one centre to carry out altruistic egg donation for research will not affect the outcome of the consultation.          'The centre agreed to provide the HFEA with regular information on their work in the meantime to inform our decision making.          'The HFEA has a statutory obligation to consider research applications as they come in and therefore must deal with them.'"

For years there has been an anecdotal belief that high levels of stress are   linked to the greying of hair, now following a study with mice researchers   have confirmed there is some truth in it. The US team found that the appearance of grey hairs could be the result of a   depletion of stems cells.Hair and skin colour is controlled by melanocyte stem cells which are found in   the base of hair follicles - an area known as the bulge.Dr Mayumi Ito and colleagues from New York University discovered stress not   only causes stem cells to leave, but when they do they are not replaced, and   therefore the hairs turn white.The scientists investigated the stem cell behaviour by looking at how they   leave hair follicles to repair damaged skin.“Stress hormones promote melanocyte migration from hair follicles to damaged   skin,” Dr Ito said. 'We thought it would be interesting to speculate that excessive stress might   promote this migration too much.'The study has fascinated scientists from around the world, including Associate   Professor Rick Sturm from the University of Queensland, Australia.He said: 'Normally stem cells only stay in the bulge region.'If you lose the stem cells from the bulge region, the hair follicles in that   area would become white.'Grey hair caused by ageing is the result of exhaustion and loss of melanocyte   stem cells, and stress could cause similar results.The study may also point to new methods of treatment for skin pigmentation   disorders.Dr Ito added: 'If we can know more about how melanocytes migrate, we may be   able to improve the treatment of other skin pigmentation disorders.'The study was reported in the Nature Medicine journal."

Most people   affected are over 65, but anyone can have a stroke, including children and   even babies.A stroke is the third most common cause of death in the UK. It is also the   leading cause of severe disability with more than 250,000 people living with   disabilities caused by stroke.In a study that shows for the first time how the treatment works Prof Darwin   Prockop of the Center for Gene Therapy, Tulane University, New Orleans, and   colleagues discovered that injected stem cells exert their healing effect by   triggering the production of biochemicals that reduce inflammation.The researchers report their finds in the Proceedings of the National Academy   of Sciences. “Our paper provides for the first time a molecular explanation of how adult   stem/progenitor cells can ameliorate ischaemic (reduced blood flow) damage   to the brain,” said Prof Prockop.They also investigated how the use of genes in the brain changed in mice   briefly deprived of blood flow to the brain. The team found that 586 genes   were used at higher levels after the flow was halted.But if stem cells were injected into the brain, 10 percent fewer genes were   activated, suggesting that those genes are likely to be involved in   inflammatory and immune responses.“We are planning clinical trials of the cells we used in patients with   stroke,” said Prof Prockop, adding that the team is building a facility of   sufficient standard to produce the stem cells for use in patients. “In the   meantime we are planning further experiments in mice and a larger animal,   probably pigs, on efficacy and toxicity.”Various companies are preparing cells for brain repair, notably ReNeuron in   the UK, which recently announced how its neural stem cell lines can be mused   to model a form of Parkinson’s disease that strikes relatively early."
telegraph,8/11/2007 0:01,news,"Stroke victims and Alzheimer's patients could have their memories repaired through stem cell therapy, scientists say.         Researchers believe their research opens up the possibility of new brain cells being grown to reverse memory loss in millions of people who suffer from dementia and brain injuries.          Tests showed stem cells, the body's basic building blocks used for repair and growth, can turn into new brain cells and produce a chemical that protects existing damaged ones.         Scientists at the University of California say their findings, highlighted in this week's New Scientist, provide hope that new drugs could be developed to repair memory damage caused by disease and injury.         Prof Frank LaFerla, of the University of California, said: 'Our research provides clear evidence that stem cells can reverse memory loss.          'This gives us hope that stem cells someday could help restore brain function in humans suffering from a wide range of diseases and injuries that impair memory function.'         The researchers genetically engineered mice with damaged cells in the hippocampus – a part of the brain which is vital to memory function.         They then injected nerve system stem cells from newborn mice into the brains of the damaged mice. Tests showed their memories recovered within three months.          By staining the stem cells the researchers were able to track them in the brains of the mice. A small proportion turned into brain cells while the rest appeared to be supporting injured cells by producing beneficial chemicals called neurotrophins.         Clive Ballard, the director of research at the Alzheimer's Society, said: 'This study is a major advance which demonstrates the potential of stem cell therapies to improve memory function for people with stroke and Alzheimer's disease.'"
telegraph,30/03/2004 00:01,news,"The Deacon family has mixed feelings about using gene therapy in the womb to treat haemophilia, which causes uncontrolled bleeding.          Ismena Deacon, 35, a consultant engineer, and her husband Chris, 36, an executive in financial services, have no history of the disease in their families so it came as a shock when their son was diagnosed with severe haemophilia A.          A few hours after Alexander's birth at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital he collapsed with bleeding into his abdomen and had to be resuscitated in intensive care.          'It was touch and go for a while,' said Mrs Deacon. Alexander was found to have less than one per cent of normal levels of factor VIII and diagnosed with the bleeding disorder. He bruised easily while crawling at home in Fulham, although the family was spared serious bleeding that would have meant hospital.          'Though it is serious, 98 per cent of the time we could treat him just like we do our daughter,' said Mr Deacon. Since the end of last year, the one-year-old has had three injections of the missing factor each week 'which makes a huge difference and should prevent him having a joint bleed', said Mrs Deacon.          His diagnosis raises the possibility that Ismena and her four-year-old daughter, Helen, are carriers of the faulty factor VIII gene that causes the disease. Would she consider gene therapy if her unborn child were diagnosed in pregnancy?          So long as the risks and side effects of the technique were fully explained along with the benefits, Mrs Deacon felt it was worth considering.          'The idea of gene therapy is fine and not meddling too much, so long as it is well controlled.'          She added that foetal gene therapy should be considered only for medical uses, not to enhance a child's intelligence or for cosmetic reasons to create a designer baby.          'There has to be tight control of this technology.'          Her husband said if gene therapy in the womb were viable, potentially it could be effective, as haemophilia A was caused by a single component and affected only clotting.          But he would prefer conventional gene therapy in which corrective genes are introduced at intervals over a lifetime to correct the condition.          He is sceptical about how easy it will be to use gene therapy to treat more complex conditions.          'I am not sure we know what the long-term effects of genetic modification will be,' he said."
telegraph,15/02/2001 00:00,news,"THE first analysis of the entire set of human genetic instructions was published last week, revealing far fewer genes than expected.                  What is a gene?  Genes hold the instructions to make proteins, the large molecules used to build and operate cells in our body. All proteins consist of simpler molecular units, called amino acids. Cells contain molecular machinery to read genes and join a chain of amino acids to make a protein for a given job. This might be to catalyse a chemical reaction, send a signal, act as a hormone, or even act as a molecular machine that squeezes muscles.          Scientists also found that these instructions were strikingly similar across all ethnic groups, with every person sharing 99.99 per cent of their genetic code with all others. The research by rival teams, one public and one privately funded, suggests that the 'book of humankind' is even more wonderful and mysterious than previously thought.It reveals an extraordinary trove of information about human development, physiology, medicine and evolution that will pave the way to personalised medicine. However, the work has been marked by controversy.Although the teams have worked independently, the public project claims that the private team's analysis relied heavily on its data. Dr Tim Hubbard, of the Sanger Centre near Cambridge, the main institution with public support, said: 'This has vindicated the approach of the public domain project.'Already, treatments are being envisaged based on newly-found genes for asthma and Alzheimer's disease, as well as depression and other mood disorders. The public team points out in the journal Nature that all current drugs on the market are based on just 483 biological 'targets' in the human body. They have now revealed hundreds of thousands more.This figure reflects the number of proteins in the body. But the surprise is that this vast diversity is described by as few as 26,000 genes - far fewer than previously estimated. The public team also found that hundreds of human genes appear to have been exchanged with bacteria at some point in evolution.We also share many genes with more humble organisms - about half with the fruitfly and the nematode worm, and about a fifth with yeast. All that distinguishes an Inuit from a Cockney or an Aborigine, even Britney Spears from Diana Ross, are variations in 300,000 letters in a three billion letter sequence in the human genome.There are four letters used in the genetic alphabet. Each letter is a chemical unit that forms steps within DNA's ladder-like structure. Variations in the genome's sequence of three billion letters spells out our genes, the instructions to make proteins, the large molecules used to build and operate cells in our body.Because only 1.1 per cent of the genome consists of genes - the rest appears to be mostly repetitive junk - the biological differences that influence everything from our looks to our intellectual ability boil down to differences between 1,000 and 10,000 genetic letters, according to Dr Craig Venter, of Celera Genomics, the privately funded team.People from different racial groups can be more genetically similar than individuals within the same group, according to the study his team published in the journal Science. Individual variations in genetic code represent just 0.01 per cent of the sequence of letters.Dr Venter's team analysed DNA samples from five people: three women and two men. This group included one African-American, one Asian-Chinese, one Hispanic-American, and two Caucasians. They were selected in part 'to make a statement', said Dr Venter.It is often the case that two people from the same part of the world who look superficially alike are less related to each other than to people from other parts of the planet who may look very different. Dr Venter said: 'No serious scholar in this field thinks that race is a scientific concept. It is just not.'Prof Svante Paabo, of the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, is optimistic that as we learn more about the genetic similarities and differences between individuals, this knowledge will encourage social tolerance and compassion.It is already apparent that the gene pool in Africa contains more variation than elsewhere, and that the genetic variation found outside Africa contains only a subset of that found in Africa. 'From that perspective, all humans are therefore Africans, either residing in Africa or in recent exile,' he said.He believes that studies of genetic variation in human populations may not be so easy to abuse, in terms of using the data as 'scientific support' for racism and other forms of bigotry. 'If anything, such studies will have the opposite effect because prejudice, oppression and racism feed on ignorance.'But there are potential problems. He cites the possibility of discrimination by insurance companies and 'genetic hypochondria', where some people will spend a lifetime expecting a disease that never arrives. The greatest danger he sees in what he calls the post genomic era is an over-emphasis on our genes as the only component that makes up our 'humanness'.The human genome has been labelled the Book of Man. The notion that our genome is synonymous with our 'humanness' is gaining strength. However, the history of our genes 'is but one aspect of our history'. There are other histories that are even more important, said Prof Paabo.He said: 'Many people in the Western world feel a connection to ancient Greece from which arose fundamental features of Western architecture, science, technology, and political ideals such as democracy. Yet at best a tiny fraction of the gene pool of the Western industrialised world came from the ancient Greeks . . . it is a delusion to think that genomics in isolation will ever tell us what it means to be human.'"

Scientists also found that these instructions were strikingly similar across all ethnic groups, with every person sharing 99.99 per cent of their genetic code with all others. The research by rival teams, one public and one privately funded, suggests that the 'book of humankind' is even more wonderful and mysterious than previously thought.It reveals an extraordinary trove of information about human development, physiology, medicine and evolution that will pave the way to personalised medicine. However, the work has been marked by controversy.Although the teams have worked independently, the public project claims that the private team's analysis relied heavily on its data. Dr Tim Hubbard, of the Sanger Centre near Cambridge, the main institution with public support, said: 'This has vindicated the approach of the public domain project.'Already, treatments are being envisaged based on newly-found genes for asthma and Alzheimer's disease, as well as depression and other mood disorders. The public team points out in the journal Nature that all current drugs on the market are based on just 483 biological 'targets' in the human body. They have now revealed hundreds of thousands more.This figure reflects the number of proteins in the body. But the surprise is that this vast diversity is described by as few as 26,000 genes - far fewer than previously estimated. The public team also found that hundreds of human genes appear to have been exchanged with bacteria at some point in evolution.We also share many genes with more humble organisms - about half with the fruitfly and the nematode worm, and about a fifth with yeast. All that distinguishes an Inuit from a Cockney or an Aborigine, even Britney Spears from Diana Ross, are variations in 300,000 letters in a three billion letter sequence in the human genome.There are four letters used in the genetic alphabet. Each letter is a chemical unit that forms steps within DNA's ladder-like structure. Variations in the genome's sequence of three billion letters spells out our genes, the instructions to make proteins, the large molecules used to build and operate cells in our body.Because only 1.1 per cent of the genome consists of genes - the rest appears to be mostly repetitive junk - the biological differences that influence everything from our looks to our intellectual ability boil down to differences between 1,000 and 10,000 genetic letters, according to Dr Craig Venter, of Celera Genomics, the privately funded team.People from different racial groups can be more genetically similar than individuals within the same group, according to the study his team published in the journal Science. Individual variations in genetic code represent just 0.01 per cent of the sequence of letters.Dr Venter's team analysed DNA samples from five people: three women and two men. This group included one African-American, one Asian-Chinese, one Hispanic-American, and two Caucasians. They were selected in part 'to make a statement', said Dr Venter.It is often the case that two people from the same part of the world who look superficially alike are less related to each other than to people from other parts of the planet who may look very different. Dr Venter said: 'No serious scholar in this field thinks that race is a scientific concept. It is just not.'Prof Svante Paabo, of the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, is optimistic that as we learn more about the genetic similarities and differences between individuals, this knowledge will encourage social tolerance and compassion.It is already apparent that the gene pool in Africa contains more variation than elsewhere, and that the genetic variation found outside Africa contains only a subset of that found in Africa. 'From that perspective, all humans are therefore Africans, either residing in Africa or in recent exile,' he said.He believes that studies of genetic variation in human populations may not be so easy to abuse, in terms of using the data as 'scientific support' for racism and other forms of bigotry. 'If anything, such studies will have the opposite effect because prejudice, oppression and racism feed on ignorance.'But there are potential problems. He cites the possibility of discrimination by insurance companies and 'genetic hypochondria', where some people will spend a lifetime expecting a disease that never arrives. The greatest danger he sees in what he calls the post genomic era is an over-emphasis on our genes as the only component that makes up our 'humanness'.The human genome has been labelled the Book of Man. The notion that our genome is synonymous with our 'humanness' is gaining strength. However, the history of our genes 'is but one aspect of our history'. There are other histories that are even more important, said Prof Paabo.He said: 'Many people in the Western world feel a connection to ancient Greece from which arose fundamental features of Western architecture, science, technology, and political ideals such as democracy. Yet at best a tiny fraction of the gene pool of the Western industrialised world came from the ancient Greeks . . . it is a delusion to think that genomics in isolation will ever tell us what it means to be human.'"
telegraph,24/01/2001 00:00,news,"THE first application to carry out cloning of human embryos is about to be submitted by scientists.Prof Peter Andrews of Sheffield University said yesterday that he and his colleagues would 'soon'submit an application to use spare IVF embryos and hoped to clone early human embryos. A licence to conduct such work could be issued in as little as nine months.The embryos would be used for research on stem cells, the parents of all cell types which offer the means to repair damage caused by Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, stroke, spinal cord injuries, heart disease and diabetes. The BioIndustry Association said human trials of stem cell treatments could start within three years.But Prof Andrews emphasised that this was no quick fix. He said: 'I find it difficult to envisage routine use on other than selected volunteers in the next 10 years.' He said he also hoped to apply for permission to clone an early human embryo from a patient's own cells. A vote on Monday night in the Lords gave a large margin of support for an extension of research on human embryos, to the surprise of Prof Andrews and other scientists who had been told that defeat was likely.Such embryos, left over from the creation of test-tube babies by in vitro fertilisation, have been used for the past decade for strictly defined studies on infertility, congenital disease or miscarriages, contraception and screening embryos for genetic defects.Now Prof Andrews's team is to apply to extend its studies. Early embryos, consisting of 100 or so cells, would be dismantled to obtain their stem cells to see how they could be used to create heart muscle, blood cells and nerve cells. Animal experiments suggest that implanted embryonic stem cells can diversify to replace missing types. But Prof Andrews said: 'We need a vast amount of research to get this right.'Other scientists who are expected to take advantage of the Lords vote include Dr Austin Smith of the Centre for Genome Research, Edinburgh University. Consent for embryo research would be required from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. For embryo cloning, permission would also be required from the egg donor and the person who donated a cell for the experiment, said Ruth Deech, HFEA chairman.She said yesterday that the authority 'is ready' for applications from scientists to conduct therapeutic cloning and stem cell research on IVF embryos. 'We have been licensing research on embryos since 1991,' she said, adding that the procedure to judge the applications had, if anything, been criticised for being too tight.But she did not expect to be inundated with applications to carry out cloning, given the small number of scientists who had relevant expertise. The research had to be judged by both the HFEA and peer reviewers to be desirable; the use of embryos must be essential and limited to numbers that were necessary, and limited to studies of serious illness. She again emphasised that the cloning of babies would not be allowed.Mrs Deech acknowledged that there were many people who opposed all embryo research, but said 'their views have not prevailed since 1990, because of the Warnock report of 1984'. Baroness Warnock, a cross-bencher, had said approval for an extension of embryo research had been rushed through.But Mrs Deech said: 'Surely she must know that her committee looked at it, that we looked at it in 1998, the Donaldson committee looked at it, the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the Royal Society. Never has a topic been so thoroughly examined from all points of view.'Her comments were echoed by Prof Richard Gardner of Oxford University, co-author of the Royal Society report on therapeutic cloning who conducted research with the IVF pioneer Prof Robert Edwards in the Sixties. 'This has been coffee-time conversation in the lab since 1966. Cloning has been discussed since the early Seventies.'"
telegraph,27/08/2010 07:00,foodanddrink,"The genetic code of wheat, which is five times larger than the human genome, has been mapped out by scientists for the first time. The genome sequence is expected to help scientists develop new wheat strains   which are more resilient to harsh conditions and disease and deliver higher   yields. Scientists hope the breakthrough will ease pressure on the world’s food supply   and help stabilise rising food prices. Wheat is one of the world's most important food crops, with an annual global   harvest of more than 550 million tonnes. The cereal is worth more than £2   billion to Britain's agricultural industry each year. The new genome data will give breeders and scientists access to 95 per cent of   all wheat genes. Professor Keith Edwards, one of the researchers from the University of Bristol   who worked on the blueprint, said the size and complexity of the wheat   genome made it a 'huge challenge for scientists'. Further work is needed to produce a finished copy of the genome, with the data   assembled into chromosomes. Dr Anthony Hall, another member of the team from the University of Liverpool,   said: 'Wheat production is already under pressure with failures in the   Russian harvest driving up world wheat prices. It is predicted that within   the next 40 years world food production will need to be increased by 50 per   cent. 'Developing new, low input, high-yielding varieties of wheat will be   fundamental to meeting these goals. using this new DNA data we will identify   variation in gene networks involved in important agricultural traits such as   disease resistance, drought tolerance and yield.' The project was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research   Council (BBSRC). David Willetts, the Universities and Science Minister, said: 'This is an   outstanding world class contribution by the UK to the global effort to   completely map the wheat genome.' The information has been made publicly available via the EMBL European genetic   database. "
telegraph,25/09/2006 00:01,news,"The most common cause of blindness in old age could one day be reversed with cell transplants into the eye, scientists say.          Researchers have improved vision in rats suffering from a disease similar to age-related macular degeneration using embryonic stem cells.          The team that developed the treatment said that if further tests showed promise they would attempt the approach on patients in as little as two years.          The study is published in the journal Cloning And Stem Cells by Robert Lanza and Irina Klimanskaya at Advanced Cell Technology, Massachusetts, and Raymond Lund at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City.          Researchers grew retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) –the cells that support the light sensing cells in the eye – from human embryonic stem cell lines cultured in the laboratory.          The team transplanted the tissue into the eyes of a breed of rat that had an RPE defect, causing blindness. The transplanted cells did not cause any side effects.          The treated rats retained some six layers of rods and cones in their retinas, giving them 70 per cent the visual capability of normal rats.          Dr Lanza said: 'We have demonstrated that these human embryonic stem cell-derived cells can rescue visual function in animals that otherwise would have gone blind.'          Prof Ian Wilmut, editor-in-chief of Cloning And Stem Cells and the director of the Centre for Regenerative Medicine, in Edinburgh, described the observations as 'very exciting'.          He said: 'They show that one day it will be possible to treat diseases of human eyes with cells. They also emphasise the great potential benefit of research with human embryo stem cells, in this case for cell therapy.'          Embryonic stem cells would offer a safe and reproducible source of replacement tissue to restore photo-receptors damaged or destroyed by disease and to restore a range of visual functions.          Dr Lanza said that the eye was an 'immune privileged site' so that transplanted cells were not rejected as aggressively as elsewhere in the body.          More than 50 million people worldwide are estimated to have irreversible blindness as a result of macular degeneration, making it the most common cause of blindness for those over 60. It is estimated that 30 per cent of the population will have some form of degeneration by the time they reach the age of 75."
telegraph,11/10/2005 0:01,news,"The professor who cloned the first human embryo in the West said yesterday that red tape and a lack of funds had driven him to leave Britain for a better-funded post abroad.          The Prime Minister has declared that the Government wants to make Britain the 'science capital of the world'.           But 'there is too much talk and too little action', said Prof Miodrag Stojkovic who, with colleagues at Newcastle University, announced in May that they had cloned a human embryo.           Yesterday, Prof Stojkovic explained why he and his wife, Petra, a technician, took up the offer from the Prince Felipe Research Centre, in Valencia, Spain, where he will be become deputy director and lead its regenerative medicine effort from January.           Britain was proud of how it regulated stem cell research 'but forgot the other important factors, notably financial support', said Prof Stojkovic. He would have stayed if it had 'got its act together'.          Even though the effort at Newcastle has grown rapidly, Prof Stojkovic estimates that Valencia remains at least three years ahead.          There is huge potential in stem cells, which can be turned into all 200-plus types in the body to treat Parkinson's, heart disease and many other ailments.          The most successful team in cloning human embryos, based at Seoul National University, has been given £11 million funding while California is to invest £1.7 billion in stem cell research in the next decade. The Newcastle effort to clone human embryos was backed with only £250,000.          The Department of Health has set up the UK Stem Cell Initiative which, according to one committee member, is considering increasing the British commitment by £10 million annually for work on stem cells.           The Department of Health said that the initiative would report 'in the autumn' on what had to be done to maintain Britain's world lead in stem cell research, adding that research councils had earmarked at least £40 million in funding.          But time is running out. At the end of 2004, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were told by one venture capitalist in the initiative that Britain had 'a maximum of a year to get this right' if it was not to lose out on its stem cell research.          'It is very frustrating to see that other people, because of different regulation and governmental support, are running away from us,' said Prof Stojkovic.           For his efforts to clone a human embryo with Prof Alison Murdoch, as part of research on diabetes, it took nine months to receive a licence in Britain, compared with nine days in South Korea, he said. Permission was given only to clone healthy cells, when the real aim was to clone those from a patient with Type 1 diabetes. That took another eight months to obtain.          British scientists expend much energy competing with each other rather than the rest of the world. Funding is so scarce and competition so fierce that a grant application can be sabotaged by an unsympathetic 'referee' from a rival group.           When it became known that Prof Stojkovic was leaving, Prof Christopher Edwards, the vice-chancellor of Newcastle University, said: 'His move confirms our belief that if we are to both attract and keep world-class scientists in the UK we have to offer them the best facilities.'"
telegraph,28/02/2002 00:01,comment,"THE report of the House of Lords Select Committee on stem cell research, published yesterday, opens the way for so-called therapeutic human cloning in Britain. It will establish the world's first stem cell bank, regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). This has been hailed by the Government as a triumph for British science. It is supposed to herald a 'reverse brain drain' from America, where the President and Congress, while permitting research on existing embryos, are moving towards a total ban on all forms of human cloning.Leaving aside the fundamental objection to all scientific research that treats the human embryo as disposable tissue - that such research does not respect the dignity of life, but instrumentalises it - there remain serious doubts about the committee's conclusions. It dismisses the possibility that therapeutic cloning here could be used for reproductive cloning elsewhere, but others fear a black market in cloned embryos. Britain is now on a collision course with the Bush administration, which yesterday revealed at a UN meeting that it is to press for a global ban on all human cloning.The report acknowledges the progress of adult stem cell research, which is uncontroversial, but it claims that embryonic stem cell research remains necessary in order 'to ensure maximum medical benefit'. Many specialists in adult stem cell research disagree with this; but none was invited to give evidence. This lends weight to the charge that the committee did not approach this issue with a genuinely open mind.The legalisation of therapeutic cloning is of dubious benefit to 'British science', since the chief beneficiary is likely to be the Californian-based Geron corporation, the market leader in cloning technology. However, most commercial funding in America is now going into adult stem cell research, which is seen as far more promising, and may produce the improvements in human health that all sides seek. A 'reverse brain-drain' looks fanciful.Public opinion in Britain, too, does not support human cloning, whether for therapeutic or reproductive purposes. Despite Parliament, a broad national consensus is still lacking. Though the Lords committee was chaired by the Bishop of Oxford, most of his fellow Anglican bishops, besides other churches and faiths, have grave reservations. The HFEA, an unelected quango, will now license experiments that leave many people profoundly uneasy. Cloning, with all its moral implications, is too important to be left to the experts."

telegraph,30/11/2010 07:50,news,"The Royal Society is celebrating its 350th anniversary by highlighting 12 huge challenges facing humanity – from alien life to geoengineering. Tom Chivers reports. This year, the Royal Society – Britain’s oldest and most prestigious scientific   body – has been celebrating its 350th anniversary. Since its foundation, our   understanding of the world has changed beyond recognition. But what will be   the challenges that define the coming centuries? As its anniversary year   draws to a close, some of the society’s most eminent experts have published   Science Sees Further, a report that selects the 12 key issues that will do   most to shape science in the 21st century, and offers an educated guess   about what we can expect in the years to come. • Search for alien lifeWhat do we know now?We know there is a lot of space   for life to appear in – 100 billion stars in our galaxy, and 100 billion   galaxies in the universe. We have started to discover that some stars have   planets: we have found 500 or so, of which around 20 are less than 10 times   the size of Earth, and may be rocky. And we have found traces of water on   Mars, as well as Europa and Enceladus, moons of Jupiter and Saturn,   suggesting they are promising places to search for life. But still, we know   very little. We have not found any life anywhere but Earth; we don’t know   whether alien life will need water, or if water is common outside our solar   system; and crucially, we don’t know how likely life is to appear.What will happen next?Impossible to say. We could detect a signal from an alien intelligence   tomorrow – or never. But Dr Martin Dominik of the University of St   Andrews and Professor John Zarnecki of the Open University argue that there   are preparations we should make, just in case. For a start, we need to   determine whether, if ET is out there, we really want to meet him. “As   historical examples indicate, meeting a civilisation similar to ours might   actually turn into a disaster.” Even finding alien microbes carries risks:   “Any strategy must exclude biological contamination – not just to protect   ourselves, but also to support cosmic biodiversity.” But, in the end, “the   search for life is a search for ourselves: where we came from, why we are   here, and where we will be going. If we want to know, we have to keep   exploring.”•  Greenhouse gasesWhat do we know now?The realisation that the amount of CO2  in our atmosphere is increasing came   half a century ago – and thanks to the work of the American scientist   Charles David Keeling, among others, we have long known that it is   predominantly due to human activity. Yet our knowledge of how much CO2    levels have actually risen is surprisingly patchy. There are many monitoring   stations worldwide, but much of the surface of the Earth is missed out,   records of the upper atmosphere are patchy, and analyses suggest that the   emissions countries are declaring are in error, and in need of independent   verification.What will happen next?New methodologies will soon allow us to move from crude global emission   figures to region- and country-specific totals. After that, it is harder to   predict. “Will ocean acidification and de-oxygenation cause large swathes of   tropical oceans to become 'marine deserts’?” ask the society’s experts.   “Will plant growth increase as CO2 rises?” The answers will affect the lives   of millions of people.•  Coping with uncertaintyWhat do we know now?The universe is unpredictable – both at the quantum level, where randomness   reigns, and on the larger scale, where chaos theory shows that tiny changes   can make huge differences to complex systems. “The problem of handling   uncertainty is common across all disciplines,” says Professor Tim Palmer of   Oxford University. But the public perception of science is that it involves   definitive, confident answers. When erroneous predictions are made about a   “barbecue summer” or an imminent flu epidemic, public trust is eroded. But   rational decisions can be made using uncertain scientific advice.What will happen next?Scientists’ understanding of unpredictability is making great strides,   especially with complex systems such as climate. And in understanding   uncertainty they can develop techniques to reduce it. But they need to   improve the way they communicate uncertainty better – both to the public,   and between different disciplines. Prof Palmer argues that we need to become   more comfortable with predictions that have odds attached – which could, he   says, end the “false dichotomy” of belief in climate change vs scepticism   about it.•  Healthy ageingWhat do we know now?Optimism that we could find a “magic bullet” to slow ageing had faded   recently, says Professor Dame Linda Partridge of University College London,   as findings suggested that there was “no single ageing process, but a host   of problems occurring in parallel”. But in recent years, ageing research has   been revolutionised: creating mutations in specific genes, or altering   creatures’ diets, have greatly extended the lifespans of a host of very   different organisms, including yeast, roundworms, fruit flies, mice and   primates. These do not just live longer, but become healthier, more   youthful, and less prone to age-related diseases such as cancer and heart   disease – and encouragingly, the equivalent genes have also been found in   humans.What will happen next?“Some modest increase in lifespan may occur,” says Prof Partridge, “but this   is likely to be minor in comparison to the steady increase in life   expectancy of two to five years per decade that we have seen since the   mid-19th century.” The real benefits are likely to come from medicines that   stave off diseases of old age, allowing us to lead fuller lives for longer.•  Cultural evolutionWhat do we know now?What separates humans from animals? Many would say culture: how we pass   knowledge down the generations, creating customs and traditions. Recently,   however, it has become clear that local traditions have been found in   dolphins, meerkats, monkeys and apes. Also, humanity’s culture has been   shown to go back much further: stone tools have been discovered dating back   2.6 million years, while cave paintings and jewellery are thought to have   developed 100,000 years ago – 60,000 years earlier than once thought.What will happen next?Hopefully, the development of a new field of science. The suggestion that   cultural ideas – or “memes” – evolve in a comparable fashion to genes is   being taken increasingly seriously, with some hailing it as a “second   inheritance system” that sits alongside and interconnects with traditional   genetic evolution.   This could have profound implications for biology and anthropology.•  Adapting to climate changeWhat do we know now?Throughout history, our survival and success have been challenged by climate   change, disease and shortages of food, materials and energy: at one stage,   the aftermath of a gigantic volcanic eruption reduced humanity’s numbers to   just 15,000. “It is a reasonable conclusion that if carbon and other   emissions continue to grow at present rates, the changes will be so large   and so rapid that the adverse effects will quickly outweigh any local   benefits and come to dominate in all regions of the world,” say Professor   Judith Howard and Professor Martyn Chamberlain of Durham University.   Population growth, disease and water and food shortages will also pose   problems for humanity.What will happen next?The key challenge will be energy management, via a “balance of renewables,   nuclear and carbon-based sources”. New sources of food, including   genetically modified crops, will also be important. “Pessimism in the face   of formidable change is not the way forward,” say Profs Howard and   Chamberlain. •  Understanding selfWhat do we know now?The brain, with its one hundred thousand million neurons, connected by one   thousand million million links, “is often dubbed the most complex object in   the known universe”, says Professor Colin Blakemore of Oxford University.   Although almost all the things it can do – the richness of human language   aside – have been seen in other animals, no other creature is as mentally   versatile. However, we are only just beginning to take the first steps   towards explaining our remarkable cognitive abilities in terms of how our   brain actually works. New techniques such as functional magnetic resonance   imaging (fMRI) have revealed many details of which parts of the brain are   involved in thoughts and emotions, but a huge amount is still unknown.What will happen next?Most of the really big questions are focused on the phenomenon of   consciousness and our sense of self. Great strides have been made, thanks to   studies of the effects of brain damage and ingenious experiments on   decision-making and brain function, but scientists will be hoping to solve   the “deep mysteries” of how our self-hood evolved, and why it experiences   the world so vividly.•  The internetWhat do we know now?Over the past 20 years, humans have built the largest information network in   history – and there has been a growing recognition that the online ecosystem   needs to be treated as an important area of study. This is a new field, but   a constantly intriguing one: did you know that even though the Web has   billions of pages, you can reach any of them from anywhere else in just 20   clicks?What will happen next?The most important things are the fundamentals – ensuring that the Web   continues to grow (the experts warn that there is “nothing inevitable” about   its continued existence, or its remaining stable, open and secure) and   ensuring that the majority of humanity gets the chance to join the two   billion existing users. The broader task of understanding how it actually   works is, say the authors, so colossal a challenge that it is on a par with   “understanding the climate, our biological nature or the larger universe”.•  Stem cellsWhat do we know now?Stem cell research is one of the most promising areas in medicine – but taking   the cells from human embryos has caused enormous controversy, especially   among religious groups. These  “pluripotent cells” are “extraordinarily   useful” in research, as unlike the stem cells found in adults, they can turn   into any kind of tissue from the body. Recently, however, researchers have   developed a way to make adult cells behave like embryonic ones – although   it’s a slow process, and therapeutic uses are a long way off.What will happen next?As these adult stem cells become better understood, it will become possible to   take cells from people with inherited diseases and study the tissue, which   could be of enormous help in combating motor neurone disease, blindness,   Parkinson’s disease, muscular dystrophy, Huntington’s disease, heart failure   and more. It is hoped that a “library” of stem cell lines will be created   that would be sufficiently large to avoid immune rejection in the “vast   majority” of patients. Type I diabetes is one of the most promising areas   for stem cell treatment.•  BiodiversityWhat do we know now?“It is clear,” say Prof Anne Magurran and Dr Maria Dornelas of the University   of St Andrews, “that biological diversity is under threat as never before.”   Yet despite great efforts by generations of scientists, we still have an   incomplete record of the natural world: the number of species thought to   exist today is somewhere between five and 10 million, but it could be as few   as three million, or as many as 100 million. What we do know, however, is   that the figure is dropping. Three quarters of the ice-free land on Earth   has been changed by human activity, while the oceans’ biodiversity is eroded   by overfishing, pollution and climate change.What will happen next?Given that we depend on biodiversity to sustain our existence, we need to   learn more about how the world has changed in the past, and how the natural   world has responded. “This challenge is perhaps the greatest that our   species has ever confronted,” say Prof Magurran and Dr Dornelas, “but unless   we individually and collectively face up to it, our world will lose much of   the diversity on which we depend, before we have had the opportunity to   fully appreciate what is being lost.”•  GeoengineeringWhat do we know now?As concerns about global warming mount, the idea of deliberately altering the   climate has been moving out of the realms of science fiction, partly thanks   to a 2009 report by the Royal Society. Although some theories are fanciful,   they fall into two basic categories: one hinges on capturing carbon dioxide   in the air; the other on blocking solar energy to stop us heating up. What will happen next?A decision needs to be made about how large a role geoengineering has to play.   Opponents say that it will distract attention from reducing carbon   emissions, and any decision cannot be taken lightly: intervention in a   system as complex as the climate could have unforeseen consequences for   generations. Still, while geoengineering alone cannot stop global warming,   it would, say the society, “be foolhardy not to formulate our Plan B”.•  New vaccinesWhat do we know now?Apart from the provision of clean water, there is probably nothing that has   had a greater impact on global health over the past century than   vaccination. Millions of lives have been saved, and two diseases wiped out –   smallpox in the 1950s, and, much more recently, rinderpest, an infection of   cattle. Polio, measles, rubella and many others have been hugely reduced,   especially in developed countries. Meanwhile, forthcoming vaccines for   hepatitis B and the human papilloma virus will, it is hoped, make strides in   preventing cancers of the liver and cervix.What will happen next?Ideally, more of the same. Progress is being made towards vaccines for HIV and   malaria, and even conditions like Alzheimer’s and addiction may be amenable.   However, simply developing the vaccines is not enough. In developing   countries, “infectious diseases are still responsible for the majority of   childhood deaths”, say Professor Adrian Hill of Oxford University and   Professor Brian Greenwood of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical   Medicine. Making vaccines available cheaply, and enabling them to be stored   without refrigeration, would do much to help.More information about 'Science Sees Further’ is at royalsociety.org"
telegraph,15/10/2002 00:01,news,"The scientist who hopes to produce the first cloned human embyros in Britain denied yesterday that his research would make it easier for unscrupulous doctors to clone babies.Prof Ian Wilmut, of the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, whose team stunned the world when it unveiled Dolly the cloned sheep in 1997, has been opposed to reproductive cloning from the outset.But Prof Wilmut is working on the first proposal to produce early human embryos as a source of stem cells. These 'parent' cells are being studied worldwide as a source of tissue to repair diseased and damaged bodies. However, Prof Wilmut hopes at first to use cloning to culture cells from people suffering from serious diseases with a genetic component to help develop new treatments.Critics argue that any research on stem cells will inevitably make it easier for the handful of mavericks who have announced plans for reproductive cloning - implanting a cloned embryo into a womb to create a cloned baby.Given the potential benefits to patients of stem cells created by therapeutic cloning, Prof Wilmut says such fears should not hinder his research, particularly as the cloning of babies can be banned by legislation, as is already the case in Britain.'It is also very easy to frame a law that says it would be illegal to put an embryo produced in this way into a woman and the United Nations is working on that,' he said. 'If there are major benefits, these fears should not discourage us.'Prof Wilmut makes clear in the current issue of Nature that nuclear transfer - the technique that gave birth to Dolly - is inefficient and that many of the parameters involved are not well understood, making reproductive cloning highly risky.When regulations governing embryo research were broadened to allow cloning, it was made clear that any proposal to clone embryos for stem cells had to explain why the same research could not be done with surplus IVF embryos.The theoretical advantage of therapeutic cloning is the possibility of taking a cell from a patient and using it to 'reprogramme' a donated egg. The resulting cloned embryo of the patient can be used to create tissue that will not be rejected by the same patient.Prof Wilmut, who is likely to be the first to test new procedures governing cloning embryos in Britain, will instead focus on using cloning to derive stem cells from patients suffering from serious genetic diseases.They would provide a renewable source of cells for research into specific diseases, rather than for treatments. Such cells could not be obtained from any other source, whether adults or surplus IVF embryos, and would enable scientists to learn more about the disease concerned, Prof Wilmut said. 'You might then be able to think of some novel approaches for small molecule drugs.'One possible goal is to create stem cell lines that could help scientists to understand the contribution of genetic variations in complex conditions such as heart disease. Another idea is to use cloning to create cells that could test how an individual would respond to drugs.However, using human cloned cells merely as an alternative to animal cells would not be sufficient justification for this kind of work, Prof Wilmut said. Cells would have to be developed for applications in which animal research is either flawed or irrelevant.Prof Wilmut would not be drawn on the details of his proposal. 'We have not yet decided finally,' he said, adding that he is concerned that pro-life critics might put pressure on the many committees that regulate this work, to the disadvantage of patients who might benefit. 'We would be having to defend things.'The licensing process will take many months and will be reviewed by two committees at Roslin. Only after it has been thoroughly reviewed will the application for cloning go to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority for its consideration."
telegraph,15/02/2001 00:00,news,"THE shaky truce between rival teams of genetic scientists was abandoned last week as the publicly funded Human Genome Project launched a blistering attack on its commercial rivals for allegedly attempting to 'privatise' the 'book of life'.Last June saw a much-heralded simultaneous announcement of draft human genetic sequences by the public and privately funded ventures to end a bitterly fought race to read the entire three billion 'letters' of code. Last week, the truce ended in acrimony with the publication of the first attempts to analyse the code.Sir John Sulston, the head of Britain's public effort that read one third of the human genetic code, launched his strongest attack yet on attempts to privatise our genetic inheritance. 'Others want to charge the rest of the human race a fortune to read our own genetic code, but we're here to tell them that the human genome is not for sale.'The head of the company which produced the rival version of the Genome denied that access to its discoveries would be restricted. But Dr Craig Venter of Celera Genomics said they would take steps to stop the information being used by rival companies for commercial gain.Sir John doubted that the private effort led by Celera in Rockville, Maryland, would have succeeded without having access to the genetic information released each day by his group and those of 20 teams worldwide. And even if Celera had completed the project alone, Sir John said commercial restrictions on the use of its data would have severely inhibited research into human genes, which ultimately could lead to a wealth of new diagnostic methods and treatments.The first analysis of the human genetic code by the rival teams, published this week in the journals Science and Nature, reveals an extraordinary range of information about human origins, evolution and medicine that will pave the way to personalised medicine.'It is about the future of all life. It is information relevant to us all and must be used for the benefit of all,' said Sir John, former director of the Sanger Centre near Cambridge. As one example, he said that the public data, described in the journal Nature, had already been used to find more than 30 genes, most notably one linked with the development of breast cancer.Sir John said that his commercial rivals invited the United States at that time to shut down the public sequencing effort. Fortunately, this led to a boost in funding for the public effort, notably from the Wellcome Trust. Thanks to the public project, the data is in the public domain. 'That is what we are celebrating today. Freedom. Freedom of information. Freedom of access. Free for all, for the hundreds of thousands of individual scientists, men and women on every continent.'Data from the public genome project, available to the world free of charge, is now used by scientists in more than 100 countries around the world to search for new medical treatments. During the past two months the public genome databases have been used 160,000 times by scientists in India, 61,000 times in Mexico and 50,000 in both China and Brazil.In contrast, recent reports show that the private database of Celera Genomics is used by fewer than 50 subscribing organisations. Dr Venter defended his company's handling of the sequence and its publication in Science. He also denied that their information was being restricted, releasing it last week on the internet. 'Our data is freely available to scientists anywhere,' said Prof Venter. 'There are no restrictions on the discoveries or the patentability or the publication of it.'"
telegraph,10/8/2001 0:01,news,"THE United States government will fund limited research using stem cells from embryos left over from fertility treatments, President Bush announced this morning.Mr Bush's move follows months of public agonising after he rejected government funding during his election campaign. But the decision, considered to be one of the most important Mr Bush has had to make since entering office, is a compromise between the positions held by the pro-life and scientific lobbies.In a primetime television broadcast from his Texas ranch - the first of his presidency - Mr Bush said that the decision had been taken with 'great care' and that the issue was 'one of the most profound of our time'.He said: 'I have concluded federal funds should be used for these existing stem cell lines where the life and death decision has already been made.'Embryonic stem cell research offers both great promise and great peril, so I've decided we must proceed with great care.'In making the decision Mr Bush said he had considered two main questions. Firstly whether an embryo was a life and secondly whether an embyro should be destroyed. Mr Bush said that he had favoured government funding for the research because of the potential to cure chronic diseases and was confident that it would produce results.Scientists will now be allowed to continue research on the 60 stem cell lines that already exist. A Presidential Council will be established to regulate the research, Mr Bush added.Supporters of embryonic stem cell research say it could help to find cures for diseases such Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.Opponents, including most opposing abortion, want adult stem cell research instead. Britain has backed embryonic stem cell research but the Pope has urged Mr Bush not to do so."
telegraph,21/09/2010 07:40,news,"The unveiling of the first draft of our genetic code in 2000 was a milestone – but has medicine changed as I predicted it would?I’m not sure my daughter will ever forgive me for the full-length, nearly nude   photograph of her that appeared on this page, but in my defence, it was all   in the name of popularising science.At the time, Holly was a blue-eyed baby, who could fit neatly between my elbow   and fingertip. Now she is a brown-eyed, netball-mad, Jason Derulo-loving   pre-teen who today celebrates her 11th birthday. After she was born, I   thought it would be interesting to round up the ways in which the latest   medical research might affect her life at the grand old age of 60. But just   like her life, the trajectory of the science has already taken some   unexpected twists and turns.My article came out only a few months before scientists unveiled the draft of   the human genetic code, and I made much of how the DNA sequence of our   estimated 100,000 genes would provide all kinds of insights into how we age,   become obese and more.In fact, the number of genes turned to be far fewer than we thought – more   like 25,000. Today, we have realised that it is not the number of genes that   makes us amazingly complicated chemical machines, but the way our bodies   read, shuffle and use them.As if to mirror how the code works in a more complicated way than we first   realised, the impact of this knowledge has thus far been relatively modest:   doctors can figure out risk factors for some important diseases, such as   macular degeneration; the understanding has led to new drugs for some   cancers; and genetic tests that can predict whether people with breast   cancer need chemotherapy. While I predicted that Holly would eventually be   able to take advantage of medicine that was customised to her genetic code,   it’s taking a bit longer than I thought.I made only one fleeting reference to a technique known as gene therapy: using   viruses to implant genes, in this case to help deal with the frailty of old   age. We all inherit flaws in our DNA from our parents, or suffer mutations   in it. These can enable cancer cells to multiply out of control, or increase   our risk of being obese, or of developing diabetes or heart disease.Scientists initially had high hopes that gene therapy would be revolutionary –   but by the time Holly was born, most (including me) were disillusioned with   the idea. Gene therapy had failed to live up to the hype, as trial after   trial seemed ineffective. And that was with disorders involving a single   gene, let alone multiple-gene illnesses such as breast cancer and diabetes.   A few days before Holly came into the world, an American teenager, Jesse   Gelsinger, had actually died of a severe inflammatory reaction during a   clinical trial for gene therapy, So, when I gazed in my crystal ball on Holly’s behalf, I expected that   treatments based on growing her own stem cells would be a better bet to   repair failing eyes and grow replacement organs. Yet, since Holly was born,   gene therapy has notched up notable successes, not least in the UK, where   Professor Adrian Thrasher and his colleagues at Great Ormond Street Hospital   in London have successfully treated 20 patients, mostly with immune   disorders.The revolution began with the treatment of “bubble children”, born with a   severe immune deficiency that leaves them fatally vulnerable to disease.   Then it was used by teams in Philadelphia and London to treat a form of   blindness. In the past few days, Prof Philippe Leboulch of the University of   Paris and Harvard Medical School in Boston has reported the successful   treatment of a 21-year-old with a genetic disorder called beta-thalassaemia,   which affects haemoglobin, the protein that enables red blood cells to cart   oxygen around the body.Like any treatment, the risks – such as the implanted genes disrupting the   existing genetic code, and causing cancer – have to be weighed against the   benefits. Given the progress to date, Prof Thrasher is confident that it   shouldn’t be too long before other blood disorders, such as sickle cell   disease, can be reliably and safely treated in this way.So, with the wisdom of hindsight, I should have made more of gene therapy. But   in another respect, I feel my vision of the future has been vindicated. I   thought that by 2060, alternative medicines would have been subjected to   rigorous scientific examination, and the majority rejected as quackery. As   one sign of this trend, there’s growing recognition – despite the best   efforts of the Prince of Wales – that homoeopathy is no more effective than   a placebo.The only problem is that, despite my confidence about what the future will   bring for Holly, one aspect of medicine will remain unchanged: I doubt that   in half a century’s time, the average patient will be any  more rational   than they are today.• Roger   Highfield is the editor of 'New Scientist’"
dailymail,16/06/2015 11:03,health,"They are delicious in guacamole or cut up in salads, and we've long been told they're a healthy form of fat.But now, scientists believe avocados could help in the fight against cancer.  A new study has revealed fat from the creamy fruit can combat acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), a rare but deadly form of the disease.Fat molecules from  avocado tackles leukaemia stem cells, which are the root of the disease, as they grow into abnormal blood cells, Canadian researchers said.Worldwide, there are few drugs that tackle leukaemia stem cells.In light of the findings, the researchers hope to create an avocado-derived drug they say could one day significantly increase life expectancy and quality of life for AML patients. AML is a devastating disease and proves fatal within five years for 90 per cent of people over the age of 65.In healthy people, stem cells in the bone marrow divide and grow to form fully developed mature red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells.In patients with AML, this process goes awry.Rather than forming into healthy red blood cells, many abnormal leukaemia cells are made.These are immature cells that aren't able to develop into normal functioning blood cells.The researchers discovered the fat molecule from avocados, called avocatin B, is able to stop this process, targeting stem cells so healthy blood cells are able to grow.Professor Paul Spagnuolo, from the University of Waterloo, said: 'The stem cell is really the cell that drives the disease.'The stem cell is largely responsible for the disease developing and it's the reason why so many patients with leukaemia relapse.'We've performed many rounds of testing to determine how this new drug works at a molecular level and confirmed that it targets stem cells selectively, leaving healthy cells unharmed.Scroll down for video 'Not only does avocatin B eliminate the source of AML, but its targeted, selective effects make it less toxic to the body, too.'Professor Spagnuolo has teamed up with the Centre for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine (CCRM), in Toronto, and  a patent application for the use of avocatin B to treat AML.The drug is still years away from becoming approved for use in cancer clinics, but Professor Spagnuolo is already performing experiments to prepare the drug for a Phase I clinical trial.This is the first round of trials where people diagnosed with AML could have access to the drug.The research was published in the journal Cancer Research.  "
telegraph,3/11/2010 9:30,news,"Three blind patients had their sight partly restored after scientists developed an eye implant in a breakthrough that is being called “a significant advance”. Below are other examples of scientific breakthroughs in the race to cure blindness. * Stem cells grown   on contact lenses could be a cure for a common cause of blindness,   claim scientists. Australian researchers said that the world breakthrough   could 'dramatically improve' the sight of patients with damage to   their cornea – the clear outer shell of the eye – caused by disease or   injury. The research team removed tissue with regenerative stem cells from patients'   own eyes and then multiplied them in the laboratory on the surface of a   contact lens. This was then placed back onto the damaged cornea for 10 days,   during which the cells, which can turn into any other sort of cell, were   able to recolonise and 'patch' the damaged eye surface. Within   weeks the patients saw dramatic improvements in their vision. If early   findings bear out then the treatment could be affective for thousands of   patients in Britain and is so cheap it could be used for millions more in   the Third World. * Artificial corneas grown in the laboratory were   transplanted into patient's eyes for the first time in an operation,   scientists reported. The new technique involved growing human tissue or   collagen in the laboratory and then shaping it using a contact lens mould. Damaged and scarred tissue from the front of the eye is then removed and the 'biosynthetic'   replacement is stitched in its place. Eventually existing cells and nerves   in the eye grow over the artificial cornea incorporating it fully into the   eye. * Eye cells that are sensitive   to light were produced from skin in a breakthrough that could   eventually lead to treatments for blindness, scientists reported in August.   Researchers genetically “reprogrammed” human skin cells to possess the same   properties as those that make up the retina. The process involved first turning them into pluripotent stem (IPS) cells,   which have the potential to develop into virtually every kind of tissue in   the body. By exposing the IPS cells to a specific cocktail of chemicals, the   scientists then caused them to grow into partially developed retina cells –   the light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye which transmit nerve   signals to the brain. * Patients who were left blinded after chemical accidents have had their sight   restored using corneas grown from their own stem cells,   scientists claimed in June. In the largest study of its kind,   Italian researchers said they restored the sight of patients left blinded or   suffered severely impaired vision, after suffering chemical burns. Experts said the study, undertaken between 1998 and 2007, offers new hope to   the thousands of people who suffer chemical burns on their corneas from   heavy-duty cleansers or other substances at work or at home. The research is   also being hailed as a key breakthrough in scientific regeneration that   could give hope to other patients with otherwise irreversible eyesight. * Also in June, a new study suggested a simple way to stop you eyesight   deterioriating -   drinking red wine. Researchers have found that a substance found in   grapes and other fruits could protect blood vessels in the eye being damaged   by old age. It is effective because the compound, known as resveratrol,   stops the blood vessels from being damaged. The substance, which has been linked to anti-ageing and cancer protection in   the past, is believed to work because it protects against abnormal   angiogenesis – the formation of damaged or mutated blood vessels. This   condition is linked to cancer, heart disease and eye diseases such as   age-related macular degeneration. In the study, reported in the New England   Journal of Medicine, researchers successfully extracted adult stem cells   from healthy eye tissue before growing additional stem cells that were   placed over damaged eye tissue. * Gene therapy was used by American   scientists to improve the vision of children with hereditary   blindness. US doctors treating 12 patients with a rare genetic eye disorder   were able to significantly improve vision in the youngest, according to   medical journal The Lancet. The research, which builds on work carried out   by doctors at London's Moorfields Eye Hospital, focused on Leber's   congenital amaurosis (LCA), a disorder which causes gradual deterioration in   vision and can lead to blindness by the time the patient is 20. It occurs   when faulty genes, called RPE65, stop the layer of cells at the back of the   eye working and affects approximately one in 80,000 people. It is   responsible for one in 10 severe sight disorders in children. * Scientists cured colour   blindness in monkeys, in what some were signalling has new hope for   millions of sufferers of the condition. Researchers reported last September   that they cured the animals using a treatment called gene therapy. A   harmless virus which delivers corrective genes to the retina was injected   into the eyes of two squirrel monkeys, Dalton and Sam, who had been colour   blind since birth. Within weeks a protein produced by the corrective genes   allowed both monkeys to make out reds and greens for the first time. They   can still see the colours two years later. The breakthrough could also have   implications for other damaging genetic eye defects, including those which   can cause blindness, after researchers proved for the first time that the   brain can “rewire” itself to see things it has never been able to before. * A   new eye drop treatment was offered to help preserve the sight of   thousands of people at risk of going blind due to glaucoma, scientists   reported. The drops were first of their kind that avoid unpleasant side   effects which deter up to a third of patients from continuing their   treatment. Many patients simply refuse to apply the drops because of the discomfort,   thereby putting themselves at risk of vision loss. Regular use of the eye   drops can keep the condition under control for a patient's life time.   Without them, a patient can go blind in five to 10 years. When the disease   becomes too advanced the only remedy is surgery, which is risky and may   itself result in blindness. * In July last year, a man who was blinded in an accident at work saw his   wife for the first time after his tooth was transplanted into his eye to   restore his sight. Martin Jones, 42, a builder, had been blind for   12 years after a tub of white hot aluminium exploded in his face as he   worked at a scrapyard. He married his wife Gill, 50, four years ago but had   not seen her until after the delicate eight-hour operation to return the   gift of sight. The rare procedure meant that one of Mr Jones' front teeth   was removed and used as a lens holder in his right eye. * Scientists in November 2008, found   a way to regrow damaged optic nerves, which was claimed to open the   door to possible new treatments for people who have lost their sight though   injuries to the cells. By turning off proteins that keep nerve cell growth   in check, researchers were able to stimulate regrowth in mice with damaged   optic nerves. "

They have discovered that even people suffering from mitochondrial disease can still produce healthy mitochondrial DNA which can be used to mend the defects.  Mitochondria act like batteries, powering cells. But in mitochondrial disease the DNA does not fuel cells fully, causing problems such as muscle wasting, as in the case of muscular dystrophy.   Dr Shoukhrat Mitalipov, of the Centre for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy, has shown that it is possible to turn damaged cells back into their original stem cell form where they no longer have mutations. Those cells can then be multiplied in a lab and transplanted back into the body to repair damaged tissue.  “To families with a loved one born with a mitochondrial disease waiting for a cure, today we can say that a cure is on the horizon,” said Dr Mitalipov       Interactive:   Three parent baby graphic  (function(e,c,h,g){function d(){var i=[];return{destroy:function(){i.length=0;i=null},push:function(j){i.push(j)},start:function(){var j=i.length;var k=-1;while(++k!==j){i[k]()}i.length=0}}}function b(j,k){var i=document.createElement('script');i.async=true;i.src=j;i.type='text/javascript';i.onload=function(){this.onload=null;this.onreadystatechange=null;k()};i.onreadystatechange=function(){if(this.readyState!=='complete'){return}this.onload=null;this.onreadystatechange=null;k()};document.head.appendChild(i)}function a(){e[c].Switcher.create(h,g)}e[c]=e[c]{};var f=null;if(e[c].Switcher===undefined){if(e[c].SwitcherQueue===undefined){e[c].SwitcherQueue=f=new d();b('http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/MobileSwitcher/v2/assets/Switcher.min.js',function(){f.start();f.destroy();e[c].SwitcherQueue=f=null;delete e[c].SwitcherQueue})}else{f=e[c].SwitcherQueue}f.push(a)}else{a()}})(this,'Telegraphics','510-1422888210337',{'desktop':{'height':'','image_url':'http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/MobileSwitcher/v2/images/510-14228882031146985840.png','resizable':false,'width':'','type':'images'},'mobile':{'fallback_image_url':'http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/MobileSwitcher/v2/images/510-14228882061642172948.png','height':'','image_url':'http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/MobileSwitcher/v2/images/510-14228882061704458232.svg','resizable':false,'width':'100%','type':'images'}}); “Over the past several years, we have been working to generate stem cells for use in combating disease.  “This critical first step toward treating these diseases using gene therapy will put us on the path to curing them.  “And, unlike unmatched tissue or organ donations, combined gene and cell therapy will allow us to create the patients’ own healthy tissue that will not be rejected by their bodies.”     tmgAds.embedPlayer = tmgAds.embedPlayer  {};tmgAds.embedPlayer = {width:620,height:349,size:'620x349',vidSize:'620x415'};if(typeof(tmgAds.page.platform) != 'undefined' && tmgAds.page.platform === 'mobile') tmgAds.embedPlayer = {width:300,height:169,size:'300x169',vidSize:'300x235'};tmgAds.embedPlayer = {  'targetId'     : 'embedPlayerWrapper',  'platform'     : tmgAds.page.platform,  'width'        : tmgAds.embedPlayer.width,  'height'       : tmgAds.embedPlayer.height,  'size'         : tmgAds.embedPlayer.size,  'autoplay'     : 'false',  'vidEmbed'     : 'Q1NXA0czrPxIdLvXsIyM5m1vHd5X6I-d',  'relatedVideo' : 'http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.api.ooyala.com%2Fv2%2Fassets%3Fwhere%3Dembed_code%2Bin%2B%2528%2527M0Nmg0czpQQfdrAy2MLeEuxBlYOpsyAR%2527%252C%252783cTB2YzoZJ1HXNxi135E5jmkYFSByOw%2527%252C%2527hwNW5iYTor1nFd1iuB8RsXZuDABaeW4X%2527%2529%26api_key%3DRvbGU6Z74XE_a3bj4QwRGByhq9h2.WFFAb%26expires%3D1640995199%26signature%3D8KlfR%252FQRdrjTfSGAcZxpsFcR3s4eeeE%252BYQ06eaXpD3I',  'adTag'        : tmgAdsBuildAdTag('vid',tmgAds.embedPlayer.vidSize,'pfadx',';vidsrc=tmg;vt=embed;dcmt=text/xml',3)}tmgAds.embedPlayer.remotesrc = 'http://s.telegraph.co.uk/tmgads/tools/ooyala/iframeplayer.html?platform='+tmgAds.page.platform+'&width='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.width+'&height='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.height+'&size='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.size+'&vidEmbed='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.vidEmbed+'&adTag='+encodeURIComponent(tmgAds.embedPlayer.adTag)+'&relatedVideo='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.relatedVideo;tmgAds.embedPlayer.tmgEmbedPlayer = '<iframe src=''+tmgAds.embedPlayer.remotesrc+'&adobeDTM=live' width=''+tmgAds.embedPlayer.width+'' height=''+tmgAds.embedPlayer.height+'' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0' scrolling='no' frameborder='0'></iframe>';document.write(tmgAds.embedPlayer.tmgEmbedPlayer);   Mitochondrial mutations can cause a vast range of fatal or severely debilitating diseases, including diabetes, deafness, eye disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, heart disease, dementia, and several other neurological diseases.

telegraph,22/01/2001 00:00,news,"TONY BLAIR's support for changes in the law that would allow the cloning of human embryos for medical research faces its strongest challenge yet with the prospect of a defeat in the Lords today.Government attempts to force through an unamendable legal order that would allow scientists to experiment on embryos in the search for new cures for diseases have come up against a cross-party coalition that has the support of the leaders of Britain's major faiths. More than 40 peers have registered to speak in today's debate amid claims that ministers have used 'undemocratic' tactics to push through a law change on a major moral issue.The vote comes as an international group of leading philosophers, surveyed by The Telegraph, questioned the rush towards genetic engineering. Today's free vote follows the Commons decision last month to extend the law covering the use of human embryos in research.Since 1990, scientists have been able to experiment on embryos up to two weeks old - at a stage when they are still a ball of a few dozen cells - for research into fertility. But many scientists believe that the law should be extended so that embryos can also be used to study disorders such as cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's.Changing the law would also allow researchers to carry out a limited form of 'therapeutic cloning' - creating a genetically identical embryo of a patient and using 'stem cells' from that embryo to treat disease. Both sides said last night that the outcome of the debate, which will be on a free vote, was too close to call.Opponents of the change suggested that opinion was beginning to swing in their favour following the publication of a letter last week from religious leaders expressing concern about the proposal. Protesters are expected to gather outside the Lords this afternoon to urge peers to vote against embryo cloning.A group of Cambridge medical students signed a letter published in The Telegraph today calling the consequences of cloning 'potentially devastating'. On Tuesday the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, backed by Roman Catholic, Muslim and Sikh leaders, wrote an open letter to all peers urging them to support calls for a select committee to consider the 'huge philosophical and ethical implications of these developments'.Yesterday the Bishop of Oxford, the Rt Rev Richard Harries, added his voice to calls for a select committee. He said: 'I would like to see a committee to look at the scientific arguments in as dispassionate and objective a way as possible.' Campaigners led by Lord Alton of Liverpool, the crossbench peer, have tabled a motion that would put the legislation on hold while it was considered by a select committee of peers who would hear evidence from scientists and experts.The therapeutic cloning order would extend the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act to permit experiments on stem cells taken from cloned embryos. One long-term aim is to create an embryo from a sick patient and use stem cells to treat disease. Stem cells are the parents of all types of tissue and can be turned into any type of cell - from blood to muscle. Brain cells from a cloned embryo could be used to treat Parkinson's disease, muscle cells could be used to patch up failing hearts.Critics claim this is a morally unacceptable extension of science. But the Prime Minister has backed arguments from the pharmaceutical industry and leading scientists that the change will increase the chance of finding cures to major diseases such as Alzheimer's. There have also been claims that leading scientists who back cloning, such as the fertility expert Professor Lord Winston, have business links with the pharmaceutical industry. Lord Winston rejects the suggestion.Opponents are particularly concerned that the Government has chosen to use a statutory order rather than primary legislation to change the law. They point out that Mr Blair was willing to give Parliament an opportunity to debate a Bill to ban hunting with dogs but was not willing to do the same when human embryos were concerned. Last month the Commons, by a majority of 192, gave permission for stem cell research on embryos up to 14 days old.Baroness Warnock, the academic who helped shape existing embryology law, said in The Telegraph last week that while she backed the scientific case for allowing cloning, the use of an order was 'one more undemocratic way of proceeding'.If peers back a select committee inquiry, the order would automatically fall, forcing the Government to consider re-introducing it in the next Parliament.Among the philosophers responding to The Telegraph's survey on genetic engineering and animal cloning was Professor Noam Chomsky, 72, the linguist and philosopher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston. He said: 'We are getting to the point where serious questions arise about tampering with the living world. We have to consider whether these genetic modifications are in a fact a form of torture for these animals.'Professor Sir Michael Dummett, 75, former Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford University, had no objection to experiments on monkeys, but predicted that some scientists would be able to do 'many repugnant things' using GM technology."
telegraph,20/04/2015 17:28,news,"US researchers found that the drug miconazole instructs stem cells in the brain to repair the nerve damage of MS  A common athlete’s foot cream sold over the counter at most chemists could cure multiple sclerosis, scientists believe.  In what was described as a ‘paradigm shift’ in treating the debilitating condition, researchers found that the drug miconazole - the active ingredient in Daktarin - instructs stem cells in the brain to repair nerve damage.  A team at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio have been testing more than 700 drugs to see if anyone would be useful against multiple sclerosis.  Around 100,000 people in Britain suffer from MS and there is currently no cure. The disorder occurs when myelin, the fatty material which protects nerves is damaged, exposing the nerves and causing signalling problems between the brain and muscles.  It can lead to vision loss, fatigue, numbness and paralysis.  But the athlete’s foot drug and a cream used to treat eczema were found to stimulate the regeneration of damaged brain cells. It was found to reverse paralysis in mice.     ‘Miracle’ stem cell therapy reverses multiple sclerosis    'We know that there are stem cells throughout the adult nervous system that are capable of repairing the damage caused by multiple sclerosis, but until now, we had no way to direct them to act,' said Dr Paul Tesar, Professor of Innovative Therapeutics at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine.  'Our approach was to find drugs that could catalyze the body's own stem cells to replace the cells lost in multiple sclerosis.'  Current multiple sclerosis therapies aim to slow further myelin destruction by the immune system, but the Case Western Reserve team used a new approach to create new myelin within the nervous system.     New drug could reverse damage of multiple sclerosis    However the team said that much work remains before multiple sclerosis patients might benefit from the promising approach.  Scientists still must find ways to transform the topical medications for internal use and determine their long-term efficacy and potential side effects.  However they said the initial findings show promise of the chance of a cure for the condition and the drugs have been shown to work on human stem cells.  “This truly represents a paradigm shift in how we think about restoring function to multiple sclerosis patients,” said Dr Robert Miller of the neurosciences faculty.  'The drugs that we identified are able to enhance the regenerative capacity of stem cells in the adult nervous system. It was a striking reversal of disease severity in the mice.”     Multiple sclerosis could be 'switched off' by retraining immune system    Charities said the research was ‘exciting’ and urged clinical trials.  Dr Sorrel Bickley, Research Communications Manager at the MS Society said:  “More than 100,000 people in the UK live with MS, which is why there is a huge unmet need for new therapies that can repair the damage to myelin that occurs in the condition.  “While this is an early study, it’s exciting to think that there is now a growing list of potential myelin repair therapies that have been identified in laboratory and animal model studies.  “The next step will be to test these treatments in clinical trials to establish whether they can bring real benefits in slowing or stopping the progression of MS.”  The research was published in the journal Nature.

dailymail,26/02/2015 17:01,wires,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In the ever-complicated debate over labeling of genetically modified foods, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack offers this idea: Use your smartphone.Vilsack told members of Congress on Wednesday that consumers could just use their phones to scan special bar codes or other symbols on food packages in the grocery store. All sorts of information could pop up, such as whether the food's ingredients include genetically modified organisms, or GMOs.'Industry could solve that issue in a heartbeat,' Vilsack said during a House hearing on agriculture spending.The Food and Drug Administration handles most food-package labeling, so Vilsack's idea isn't an official proposal. But the Agriculture secretary suggested it could head off the debate between the food industry and those who have pushed for package labels that identify GMOs.He has mentioned the idea for bar codes before, but he said it could have new life as Congress becomes more involved in the issue. A Republican House bill would block state efforts to require GMO package labels, legislation that was introduced just as Vermont became the first state to require the labeling in 2014. That law will go into effect next year if it survives a legal challenge from the food industry.Labeling advocates aren't signing on to Vilsack's idea. Scott Faber, head of the national Just Label It campaign, says most consumers don't have the know-how to use their phones to scan a bar code or so-called QR code, a commonly used scannable image.'Consumers shouldn't have to have a high-tech smartphone and a 10-gigabyte data plan to know what's in their food,' Faber said.In response to those concerns, Vilsack has said in the past that there could also be in-store scanners, like those that check prices now.Vilsack said some food companies have been receptive to the idea, though he didn't name any.There's some indication that food companies are mulling something similar. A spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents the food industry, said the group is 'actively discussing ways to further provide consumers with this important information.'Jeff Beckman, a spokesman for The Hershey Co., said the company is working on new ways it can make ingredient and nutrition information 'more readily accessible through new technologies.' A spokeswoman for Nestle says that company is also part of a larger food industry discussion on the topic.The bar codes would likely be an industry, not government, effort. An FDA spokeswoman said Vilsack's idea is 'not currently under discussion' at that agency. The FDA doesn't require labeling for genetically modified foods and says they are safe.Genetically modified seeds are engineered to have certain traits, like resistance to herbicides or certain plant diseases. The majority of the country's corn and soybean crop is now genetically modified, with much of that going to animal feed. Modified corn and soybeans are also made into popular processed food ingredients like corn oil, corn starch, high-fructose corn syrup and soybean oil.Consumer advocates pushing for the labeling say shoppers have a right to know what is in their food, arguing that not enough is known about the effects of the technology. They have supported several state efforts to require labeling, with the eventual goal of having a federal standard. The food industry has vigorously opposed the effort, saying labels would be misleading because GMOs are safe.Vilsack has been supportive of genetically modified crops, saying at the hearing that there is 'no question in my mind' that they are safe. But he has called for the two sides to try to come together.'A bar code seems the best way of doing it without picking sides,' he said.___Follow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick"
dailymail,25/03/2015 15:39,wires,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Inspired by the popular 'USDA organic' label, House Republicans are proposing a new government certification for foods free of genetically modified ingredients.The idea is part of an attempt to block mandatory labeling of foods that include genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. The certification would be voluntary, says Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., who is including the idea in legislation he is introducing Wednesday.Pompeo says a government-certified label would allow companies that want to advertise their foods as GMO-free to do so, but it would not be mandatory for others. The food industry, which backs Pompeo's bill, has strongly opposed individual state efforts to require labeling, saying labels would be misleading because GMOs are safe. The bill would also override any state laws that require the labeling.Under the legislation, the Agriculture Department would oversee the certification, as it does with organics. But while organic foods must be USDA-certified to carry any organic label on a package, the department's non-GMO certification would not be required for every food that bills itself as free of genetically modified ingredients. The idea is that foods the department certifies as free of GMOs would have a special government label that companies could use to market their foods. User fees would pay for the program.The bill also steps up FDA review of genetically modified foods. Currently, food companies must comply with FDA guidance if they want to claim that foods are free of engineered ingredients.Pompeo says inconsistent state laws would be confusing and costly for consumers and for companies. Vermont became the first state to require the labeling in 2014, and that law will go into effect next year if it survives a legal challenge from the food industry.'We're perfectly happy to have folks to understand if there's GMOs or not in their food,' Pompeo said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'It is simply not the case that you can have affordable food that is safe and 1,000 different rules.'He said he is working with his party's leadership and also the Senate to try to pass the bill this year. Pompeo introduced a similar bill last year that did not include the Agriculture Department certification.Genetically modified seeds are engineered in laboratories to have certain traits, like resistance to herbicides. The majority of the country's corn and soybean crop is now genetically modified, with much of that going to animal feed. They are also made into popular processed food ingredients like high-fructose corn syrup and soybean oil.The FDA says GMOs on the market now are safe, but consumer advocates pushing for the labeling say shoppers have a right to know what is in their food, arguing that not enough is known about the effects of the technology. They have supported several state efforts to require labeling, with the eventual goal of having a federal standard.Those groups quickly criticized Pompeo's approach.'This is a faulty and disingenuous attempt to assuage consumer concern without actually giving the people the information they want and deserve,' said Andrew Kimbrell of the advocacy group Center for Food Safety. 'The most effective way to provide consumers with the full universe of information about their food is through mandatory labeling, nothing less.'Scott Faber, head of the national Just Label It campaign, described the bill as a last-ditch effort by the food industry as state legislatures are considering bills around the country that would require the labeling.According to a December Associated Press-GfK poll, two-thirds of Americans favor mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods.___Follow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick"
telegraph,22/03/2013 17:50,news,"Women suffering from breast cancer face the prospect of being able to grow their own breast tissue in a procedure pioneered by Japanese scientists. Research teams have successful managed to replace tissue that was lost by   breast cancer patients during surgery by mixing fat from other parts of   their bodies with their own stem cells.Previous attempts to regenerate breast tissue in patients involved the use of   fat alone had a success rate of only 30 per cent as the cells were swiftly   reabsorbed into the body in most cases.However, the addition of stem cell technology resulted in a success rate of 70   to 90 per cent, due to the creation of new blood vessels which were able to   support the new tissue. Stem cells. the addition of stem cell technology resulted in a success   rate of 70 to 90 per centThe small-scale study, led by Bin Nakayama, an associate professor at Tottori   University, focused on women who required breast augmentation surgery rather   than complete reconstruction.The new technique was tested on five women aged between 30 and 60 recovering   from breast cancer, using fat removed from their hip or abdomen areas mixed   with their own stem cells.After monitoring their health for one year, scientists reported the surgery a   success for each of the women, with no cases of infection or cancer   recurring, according to Professor Nakayama.As many as one in five women in the UK currently requires a second operation   after undergoing breast conserving surgery, according to a recent study of   more than 55,000 NHS patients by the Royal College of Surgeons.Widespread adoption of the technique could dramatically reduce the number of   operations required by women following surgery to remove tumours or   cancerous tissues in their breasts.'The aim of this study was to test the safety of such a procedure,'   Professor Nakayama said. 'It was a success. None of the patients   suffered any infections or problems after their health was checked for a   year.'My wish is that within a year, we will be able to perform this procedure   on patients in Japan. This will depend on new government rules surrounding   the use of stem cell, which have not yet been established but will be   decided later this year.' Breast cancer has been the most common form of cancer in the UK, with more   than 49,000 people diagnosed with the disease in 2010, according to Cancer   Research UK. Experts expressed hope the procedure could be adopted by the   NHS. Dr Rachel Greig, from the UK's leading breast cancer charity Breakthrough   Breast Cancer, said: 'This research looks exciting but at this very   early stage, and since only five women took part in the study, it is   difficult to determine the impact this procedure could have on breast cancer   patients in the future. We will watch with interest to see how this develops.'Stem cell breast surgery is the focus of an increasing number of clinical   trials, in relation to both cancer treatments and cosmetic procedures,   although scientists have warned previously that years of safety studies are   required.

telegraph,14/04/2011 23:59,news,"Workers at Japan's troubled nuclear plant should store blood cells now in case they need them later as treatment for radiation overdose, some Japanese experts suggest. Plant workers are struggling to control radiation leakage from the Fukushima Daiichi complex, which was severely damaged by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Radiation levels are dangerously high in some areas of the plant, and the experts note that the work there will take years, posing a risk of accidental exposure.High doses of radiation can destroy the blood-making cells of the bone marrow, a potentially fatal outcome that can be treated with transplants of blood stem cells. Such transplants are standard therapy now for blood diseases like leukaemia. Getting those cells from a donor takes time, and potential incompatibility between the donated cells and the recipient can lead to severe complications, the experts noted.So they suggest that the plant's workers have their own blood stem cells banked now. That involves getting injections for several days to get stem cells from the marrow to enter the bloodstream. Then blood would be drawn from one arm, processed to extract the stem cells, and returned into the other arm. That takes several hours.Once the stem cells were stored, any workers who later got accidentally exposed to a large radiation dose could get infusions of their own cells.The experts, from institutions including Toranomon Hospital and the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research in Tokyo, discuss the idea in a letter published online Thursday by the journal Lancet.They noted that reaction to the idea has been mixed since they first raised it last month. Some medical groups have supported it, while other experts have said it would pose an undue physical and psychological burden on nuclear workers, they wrote. In any case, some transplant teams are ready to collect and store the cells, they said.In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, a U.S. stem cell transplant expert said the idea might have some limited use.Dr. Nelson Chao of Duke University said the proposal would be reasonable for workers who enter high-radiation zones to clean up the nuclear complex.But its usefulness would be limited to workers who end up getting radiation doses within a rather narrow range, he said. If they get less than that, they'll recover anyway. If they get more, they'd also sustain lethal and untreatable damage to the gut and other organs including the lung. Stem cell transplants could not help with that, he said. "
telegraph,13/11/2003 00:01,news,"   Drugs that improve chance of conception may also be responsible for more human chimeras. Roger Highfield reports  Human chimeras - people who are mixtures of two genetically distinct individuals - may be becoming more common because of the increasing use of modern fertility techniques.Chimeras result when cells of two embryos fuse together and this possibility, though rare, is becoming more likely because test-tube baby methods increase the rate of twinning.Dr Margot Kruskall, of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre in Boston, Massachusetts, tells today's New Scientist that the drugs used to improve fertility can result, unintentionally, in multiple ovulation and raise the prospect that embryos can fuse.In addition, one quarter of IVF pregnancies result in non-identical twins, compared with one in 150 natural pregnancies. As a result of boosting twinning by about 40-fold, IVF is likely to increase the rate of chimeras by a similar factor.The possibility that IVF is linked to chimerism was raised by a study of a chimera by Prof David Bonthron, of the University of Leeds. 'It was not the first to come to light, but it was the first related to IVF,' he said yesterday.In 1998, his team reported the case of a chimeric IVF baby who resulted from the fusion of a male embryo and a female embryo. The child was outwardly male, but the lefthand side of his internal reproductive system had an ovary and fallopian tube.As in this case, chimeras tend to come to light when doctors investigate problems with reproductive systems and find structures from both male and female reproductive organs as a result of having cells of both sexes in their bodies.There is growing evidence that chimerism at the cellular level might be even more common. Far from being pure-bred individuals, it seems that our bodies could contain cells from our mothers and even grandparents.Some 80 to 90 per cent of women carry their children's cells or DNA in their blood during pregnancy and up to 50 per cent keep them for decades after giving birth, a condition called microchimerism. 'Women harbour cells from both their mother and their children,' said Dr Lee Nelson, an immunologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre, Seattle.In a forthcoming paper in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism, Dr Nelson and Dr Natalie Lambert describe how they took blood samples from 32 healthy women and found that 22 per cent were carrying white blood cells from their mothers. Dr Nelson speculates that these cells could encourage the mother's immune system to tolerate her foetus."

But equally impressive falls are often seen on bad news, so it is not an investment for the faint-hearted.For an example, see the chart, showing PPL Therapeutics' share price over the past year, including the week when it announced the cloning of five 'knock-out' piglets. But by buying into a pooled fund such as a unit or investment trust rather than individual stocks, you can shelter yourself from the misfortunes of a single company, making it a less risky way to invest in a high-risk sector.The long-term growth prospects for the healthcare and biotechnology funds look good, said Sue Whitbread of independent financial adviser Chartwell Investment Management. They are unlikely to make up a large part of your portfolio, but if you are prepared to take a risk, they may just provide the shot in the arm your portfolio needs. So, should you follow these piggies to market, or should your money stay at home?Ms Whitbread said: 'Whatever the state of the economy, people are going to need healthcare products, and spending in this area is not going to fall. We would argue that a healthcare or biotechnology fund should be a part of your portfolio, because the prognosis is good.'The 1990s were a very strong development period. They had the funding and backing to develop products at great expense. A significant number of companies have gone through that, and drugs are coming onto the market in the next five years to realise money for those companies. These are really the first ones in a long time that are being transferred into profit. All of the hard work has been done.'Over the past year, biotech and healthcare funds have both fallen in value, along with most other types of equity investment. But that could now provide you with an opportunity to buy. If the funds are cheaper than they were, you get more for your money. Against that, on some traditional means of valuation, these shares still look very expensive. Hopes for future growth account for much of the price today.According to figures from fund statisticians Standard & Poor's, the average fall in UK healthcare unit trusts was just under 20 per cent last year, but that rises to between 35 per cent and 40 per cent for biotechnology and healthcare investment trusts.Mark Bolland of independent financial adviser Chamberlain de Broe said: '3i Bioscience Investment Trust is trading at an 11 per cent discount at the moment, and Finsbury Life Sciences is trading at an 80 per cent discount. That is a hefty discount.'The top-performing UK unit trust over three and five years in the healthcare unit trust sector is City Financial's biotech Fund, but it did not have much competition. It is not cheap in terms of management charges, with a six per cent initial and two per cent annual charge, according to Standard & Poor's. But over five years, £1,000 invested would have increased to £3,230.One of the best-known funds is Framlington Health, which has a 5.5 per cent initial charge and 1.5 per cent annual management charge. It did not fare quite so well, but you would still have turned £1,000 into £2,586 over the same period.However, the Framlington Health & Income investment trust has done very badly, coming last in its sector. If you had put in £1,000 a year ago, you would have lost more than three-quarters of your investment.Ben Lloyd of Framlington said that this trust, which is a split capital trust, was not marketed to retail investors. But, he said: 'It is highly geared and that will affect its performance in a rising, and unfortunately a falling market.'It has the objective of investing in smaller biotechnology companies, and their share price is more volatile in the short term. But in the long term we believe it is a positive sector.'Framlington also launched a biotech fund in November last year, but it has not been around long enough for its performance to be included in these tables.Deane Donigan, a member of the healthcare team at Framlington Investment Management, said: 'We went to the management here on September 20 and said it would be a great time to launch a fund, as these stocks were low after September 11. But it takes time to go through regulation and to get approval, and the stocks had had a run from those lows. But at the end of the year, it was still above the offer price.'For healthcare investment trusts, the best performer by a long way is the Finsbury Worldwide Pharma Trust. If you had invested £1,000 here five years ago, it would be worth £3,754 now. It has also lost the least over one year.A spokesman for Close Finsbury Asset Management, which manages the Finsbury trusts, said: 'Whereas a society can stop buying new cars when times are hard, they cannot choose to suspend medical treatments. All sectors are dependent on the economic cycle, but history shows that the pharmaceutical sector is less dependent than most.'Ms Whitbread tipped Finsbury Life Sciences investment trust and the 3i Bioscience Trust for growth. She said: 'In the biotech arena, liquidity is an issue if they see a run on the fund. A closed end fund, such as an investment trust, would have structural advantages. But this is definitely not for cautious investors.'Mr Bolland recommended the Framlington Health Fund, and also the Finsbury Life Sciences Trust and the 3i Biosciences Trust."
telegraph,18/01/2001 00:00,news,"   SCIENTISTS have created the world's first genetically modified primate, a baby rhesus monkey called ANDi  SCIENTISTS have created the world's first genetically modified primate, a baby rhesus monkey called ANDi.                                Click to enlarge           The feat could hasten the development of new treatments for a range of diseases, from diabetes and breast cancer to Parkinson's and HIV. The head of the American team, Prof Gerald Schatten, said: 'It's a special step. We're at an extraordinary moment in the history of humans.' But anti-vivisectionists fear that ANDi, who was born on Oct 2 last year, will herald a surge in experiments on monkeys. They condemned the research as 'abhorrent' and accused Prof Schatten of 'playing God'.                               Apeing it: Andi the genetically modified monkey          The work also raises the issue of whether similar techniques could be used to create GM humans. ANDi - the name is 'inserted DNA' spelt backwards - received an extra marker gene, from a jellyfish, while he was still an unfertilised egg, making him the world's first genetically modified non-human primate. Prof Schatten of the Oregon Regional Primate Research Centre at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, who reports the details last week in the journal Science, said: 'ANDi is robust and plays normally with his two room-mates.'The technique used to make ANDi could pave the way to the creation of laboratory monkeys that carry human genes, offering the opportunity for medical researchers to make more realistic models of human disease. Prof Schatten said: 'We could just as easily introduce, for example, an Alzheimer's gene, to accelerate the development of a vaccine for that disease. Monkeys like ANDi will quickly but safely help us determine if innovative therapies are safe and effective.'Prof Patrick Bateson, chairman of the Royal Society working group on GM animals, said: 'Although medical benefits may result from producing GM monkeys, this sort of work must be subject to stringent monitoring of any harmful effects on the animals' welfare.' GM monkey models of human disease had limitations, he added. 'Some of the work on cognitive diseases, such as schizophrenia, can only be carried out in people.'Dr Ray Greek, spokesman for the US Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, was more sceptical. He said: 'We have been doing to mice for decades what they have done with ANDi, and we have been singularly unsuccessful.' The advance was attacked by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection because it would lead to more experiments on monkeys.The campaigns director, Wendy Higgins, said: 'It's shocking that this should happen at a time when there are worldwide calls to reduce or even abolish research using primates.'Sue Mayer, of the pressure group GeneWatch, said it was also concerned by ANDi. 'It's incredibly important that we take stock and don't allow it to lead to enormous animal suffering that isn't justified,' she said. Prof Schatten told The Daily Telegraph last week: 'I can understand the concerns regarding the use of transgenic [GM] animals as disease models. However, it is important to note that medical research is on the threshold of eradicating the diseases that still plague us last week. These cures will be developed in mouse models. However, people are very different from mice.'Consequently, to accelerate the day when these innovative therapies will be brought to patients' bedsides, we propose that a small number of specially bred monkeys many help speed the discoveries from lab benches.' He stressed that, until methods of genetic modification became more precise, transgenic monkeys would not be in common use. Even then, expense and ethical considerations would limit their use."
telegraph,28/06/2003 00:01,news," Even though ADA deficiency is the most complex and difficult form of bubble baby disease to treat with gene therapy, it was the subject of the world's first gene transplant, in America in 1990.The cells of four-year-old Ashanthi DeSilva took up the ADA gene, but there were too few copies to make enough of the missing ADA enzyme to correct her immune deficiency. Although a scientific success, it was a clinical failure and doctors fell back on replacing the missing enzyme using the drug PEG-ADA.The condition was also the subject of the first British gene therapy trial on Carly Todd in 1993 by Dr Bobby Gaspar and colleagues at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, working with groups in Holland and France.That trial also failed and in 1996, aged four, Carly had a successful bone marrow transplant from an unrelated donor. 'She is doing remarkably well,' said Dr Gaspar.New hope came when a more sophisticated form of gene therapy was conducted on an Arab-Israeli girl called Salsabil, from Jerusalem, by Prof Claudio Bordignon of the San Raffaele Institute for Gene Therapy in Milan, and Prof Shimon Slavin's team at the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centre in Jerusalem.Salsabil was born into a family where ADA deficiency had already killed one child and afflicted another, but there were no suitable donors for a bone marrow transplant. A gene transplant was the only option.Within weeks of gene therapy the number of white blood cells - lymphocytes - in her blood had risen dramatically. The toxic products in her blood, which would normally kill the lymphocytes, had declined.Salsabil went home within a month. Nearly two years after the gene therapy, her blood cells were functioning normally. Four ADA children have now been treated by the team and all have done well."
telegraph,6/1/2002 0:01,finance," In an exclusive interview, managing director Ron James tells Edward Simpkins how PPL will ride out the cloning storm IT has been a roller-coaster week for for PPL Therapeutics. The little-known Scottish biotechnology firm that shot to stardom in 1996 when it produced Dolly the sheep, the world's first cloned mammal, seemed to have scored another world first with the birth of five little cloned pigs.But the revelation, which at first sent PPL's shares soaring, sparked controversy in the world of science with allegations from rivals that PPL had flouted scientific convention and that its cloned pigs are not the first. The furore was compounded on Friday with the revelation that Dolly has arthritis at the unusually early age of five.Ron James, PPL's managing director, does not take the criticisms lying down. He says that they knew other teams were trying to achieve the same breakthrough but that they had no idea that others had succeeded and they certainly didn't know that publication was due last week in the journal Science.'We are not an academic institute. We are a publicly quoted company and the listing rules are very clear about price-sensitive information being given to the shareholders as soon as it is available.'We were castigated in the press for not announcing Dolly's birth until she was several months old. Every announcement has consistently been put on the Stock Exchange first rather than in scientific publications.'But PPL's hour of glory had been well and truly sullied by the sniping of US competitors and by wider fears, sparked by Dolly's arthritis, that cloning and its use in human medicine are unsafe.PPL is a much-lauded pioneer in the cloning of animals whose organs could be used for transplanting into humans, a controversial development which will have its place in the medical history books but which is fiercely opposed by animal rights and pro-life groups.The cloned piglets have had a gene deactivated, which makes organ rejection in a human recipient less likely and brings xenotransplants, animal organs for human transplant, a step closer to reality. As a follow-up to Dolly, it seemed hard to beat.Then a day after their announcement a rival US firm, Immerge Bio Therapeutics of Massachusetts, claimed that it too had produced a litter of cloned pigs with the same gene knocked out and that its pigs had been born three months earlier. PPL was accused of side-stepping the normal scientific peer review process in order to scoop its rivals and steal the limelight.But it was Dolly's arthritis, and the ensuing concerns that cloning can cause premature ageing, that helped wipe out much of the earlier gains in PPL's share price. Dolly's plight called into question whether cloning would ever provide tissues for use in humans.James says he is unfazed by news that Dolly has arthritis. He says that there is no way of knowing whether the condition is down to cloning or whether it is coincidence and that not enough research has been done.But Professor Ian Wilmut, the head of the original cloning team at the Roslin Institute, PPL's partner in the programme, admitted his concern and said the cloning process had yet to be perfected. He stressed the importance of monitoring clones throughout their lives.'This is still an inefficient procedure. We were always aware that there was a risk that we would find things like this. We were very disappointed and very concerned for the animals.' James says that only a small minority of cloned sheep are born perfect but that the company is not seeing the same problem with pigs.'Cloning seems to be more difficult with the particular breed of sheep that we use. A long time ago we decided to get a herd of sheep in from New Zealand where scrapie doesn't exist and since then we have bred from this closed flock so we know that it is disease free.'Many cloned animals die early, often shortly after birth, and many carry deformities and sometimes other abnormalities such as blood vessels with thickened walls which are not immediately apparent. It took 276 unsuccessful attempts before Dolly was produced and some time ago it emerged that her cells were abnormally aged. She was cloned from a cell from a six-year-old ewe and so some have argued that she is 11 rather than five.All this raises the questions of whether it is ethical to create creatures that are likely to suffer and whether the organs from the clones should be transplanted into humans. One of PPL's other achievements, that of turning skin cells into beating heart cells, also makes some people a little uneasy.'We are working to save people's lives,' James says. 'Ultimately if a few animals are going to suffer but thousands of people are going to benefit then that is a price worth paying. We are using animals but they don't suffer in the way that people imagine.'The point of cloning animals is not simply to produce more of the beasts that fill our fields. It is to genetically alter the animals so they do something useful. The cell that Dolly was produced from had a gene inserted along with a trigger that causes her milk to contain a human protein, known as AAT, which is lacking in people who suffer from certain hereditary diseases. AAT balances the action of another protein which would otherwise eat away at the lungs. These people need to be dosed with AAT but currently the only source of the protein is from human blood plasma.The German company Bayer makes sufficient AAT to treat 3,500 people a year from this source but the treatment costs $30,000 a year and it is estimated that in this country alone as many as 80,000 people could benefit.To make enough to treat them all will require hundreds of Dollys. But they don't have to be cloned. Since genes are passed on to offspring, all that is required is several founder animals that carry the human gene which can reproduce in the traditional fashion. PPL now has a herd of 600 sheep producing recAAT, as the farmed AAT is known, in Scotland and a bigger herd in New Zealand.'The core of PPL is therapeutic proteins,' James says. 'We have three lead products, the most important of which is recAAT. The most important thing the company has to do now is get them to market.'To that end PPL has formed a partnership with Bayer which is about to carry out phase-three clinical trials. If they go well PPL should be able to bring its product to market in 2005. It has two other potential products - fibrinogen, which stops bleeding and sticks wounds together, and BSSL, needed by premature babies and adults with pancreatic damage.However, neither of these is likely to be a marketable product any time soon and some analysts have doubts that PPL has the cash even to bring recAAT to market. Rule of thumb in the industry is that it costs £100m to bring a new drug to market, but that sum includes the cost of failures.Julie Simmonds, healthcare analyst at Beeson Gregory, a stockbroker that specialises in high-tech companies, says PPL's scientific achievements are remarkable but that it lacks the cash to develop them.'AAT is too far down the line to make a big difference,' she says, 'And I don't think they've got enough money. They are about £10m short of what they need to get it to market or to profitability by my reckoning so they will have to do another rights issue and that is depressing the share price.'James disagrees. 'We've got enough cash to survive until recAAT comes to market and we raised £30m in September. PPL's sole error was twice needing to raise more money when biotechnology was out of favour.'But he concedes that outside partners will be needed to carry on the development of the xenotransplantation project and the company's work on stem cells. 'My job over the next few months will be getting these spun out. We would need about £20m to get either of these to clinical trials.'They will be set up as separate companies with PPL as a large shareholder but funded by venture capital, coming from the US in the case of xenotransplantation and the UK for the stem cells. It will be his last act as an executive at PPL. His replacement, Geoff Cook, took over as managing director last week and James is sticking around for a few months to ensure a smooth handover.'When I joined from PPM ventures I thought I was going to retire at 55 and go sailing around the world,' he says, 'It didn't quite work out like that. I'm now nearly 61 but we all have dreams.'I don't think we changed the world,' he adds, 'but Dolly certainly changed the way people think.'"
telegraph,20/08/2003 00:01,news," The possibility of a blood test that can shed light on a smoker's risk of developing cancer is raised today.Scientists have discovered that the 'caps' at the end of chromosomes - telomeres - that stop them degrading may be associated with risk of smoking-related cancers.Although telomeres shorten as we grow old, studies have shown that their length varies considerably among people of the same age.Those with short telomeres, as measured in white blood cells, appear to be at an increased risk of bladder, head and neck, lung and renal cell cancers - diseases associated with cigarette smoking.According to a study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute by Dr Xifeng Wu, of the University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Centre, smokers with short telomeres had a substantially greater risk for tobacco-related cancers than people who never smoked and had short telomeres or those who smoked but had longer telomeres.

telegraph,12/5/2004 0:01,education,"             Roger Highfield reports on the aftermath of Kaguya, the first mammal to be born without any male input                  Joining Dolly the sheep on the list of creatures that have pushed forward the frontier of science, we must now add Kaguya the mouse. She marks the second scientific advance, after cloning, that appears to make males redundant.          She came into this world through a process known as 'parthenogenesis', or 'virgin birth', though scientists are still arguing about what to call a mouse that has two mothers, rather than just one.          Kaguya is not alone. Sexless reproduction abounds in nature: examples range from aphids and bees, the male drones of which come from unfertilised eggs, to the timber rattlesnake and the basilisk, called the 'Jesus Christ lizard' for its ability to walk on water. Even the turkey can do it.          But mice and men - like all mammals - have nothing to do with parthenogenesis. Even though unfertilised mouse eggs can be jolted into dividing with chemicals, temperature shifts or electric shocks, the resulting embryos do not reach term, and the same goes for humans, too.          The reason is imprinting, a mechanism that can switch genes on and off, depending on whether they come from sperm or eggs. Creatures with a gift for parthenogenesis lack 'imprinted' genes. But in mammals, at least 40 genes with diverse and important functions during development are thought to be regulated this way, so they must be inherited from the right parent for a pregnancy to succeed.          Now this apparently huge obstacle that prevents a mammal 'parthenote' from being born has been overcome by Dr Tomohiro Kono of the Tokyo University of Agriculture, with colleagues in Japan and Korea.          A few weeks ago, in the journal Nature, they outlined how they produced live female mice without any need for sperm, male chromosomes and thus males, shattering the age-old notion that two mammals of the same sex can't have offspring.          Rather than combine the imprinted male and female genetic codes, as normally happens after egg meets sperm, Dr Kono combined a female genetic code from an older egg with a 'male-like' female genetic code created from the genetic make-up of a young egg, which is free of most imprinting.          To masculinise the 'imprint-free' female code, he used genetic engineering to remove a gene (H19) from the young egg so that it was only being used in the old egg. As a result of the removal of H19, production started of a nearby growth factor (Igf2) that is normally made only from the male genetic code. The factor plays a key role in the development of the placenta, among other tissues.          The first mammal produced with two mothers, named Kaguya after a Japanese fairy-tale princess, grew to be a healthy adult female that was able to produce offspring the old-fashioned way, with the help of a male.          Dr Kono told The Telegraph it might be difficult to do this experiment in other species, but it 'is a possibility' in some domestic animals. He was silent on whether it could be used by two women to have a baby and instead pointed out how his work underlines the key role of imprinting in the development of mammals, and thus humans.          His research could help explain why some babies are born with abnormalities. Imprinting explains the cause of Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, marked by mental retardation and a host of problems: they strike when a baby fails to inherit a paternal copy of chromosome 15, or fails to inherit a maternal copy, respectively. The work could also shed light on the inefficiency and defects caused by cloning, which is thought to affect imprinting.          And the creation of parthenotes could lead to ways to produce therapeutically useful human stem cells - cells with the potential to turn into any type - without destroying embryos that have the potential, if implanted in the womb, to grow into human beings. This is an approach being studied by Prof Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, best known for his work on Dolly the sheep, who described the new study as 'very exciting and impressive'.          Dr Kono believes his work also backs a theory that explains why imprinting evolved in mammals. Put forward by Prof David Haig of Harvard University and colleagues, it rests on the most fundamental feature of all life: the urge to propagate one's genes to future generations.          Imprinting results from an evolutionary battle between the sexes, reflecting the different genetic agenda of each parent, according to Prof Haig. To put it crudely, both parents want to pass on their genes to their offspring, but a woman's genes also have her interests at heart - unlike the man's. The father wants his offspring to grow big. This will provide his offspring - and his genes - with an enhanced chance of survival and use up the mother's resources so they won't be wasted on another man's offspring.          Women, on the other hand, want to share resources with the unborn child and reduce the risk posed by unlimited foetal growth, which would be deadly. The mother also wants to survive to pass on her genes to future children.          The result, Prof Haig says, is an evolutionary arms race, with paternal genes beefing up the offspring and maternal genes holding growth in check.           Thus parthenogenetic human and mouse embryos fail to develop because they contain a double copy of growth-limiting maternal genes without paternal rivals such as Igf2 to boost growth. But it is a riddle why the Tokyo team's simple genetic modification managed to jump this hurdle.          Although the genetic and embryological technologies used by the Tokyo team are 'exceptionally complex', Prof Patrick Tam of the University of Sydney said he was 'surprised by the amazing effect of changing the activity of one gene on the rest of the genome, which effectively turns it from a maternal to an almost 'paternal' one'.           'This is an incredible achievement,' added Prof Azim Surani of the University of Cambridge. But he said the feat was too complex to be used on people. 'The process of creating these mice required perseverance and patience: from around 600 eggs only two mice were created.'           As for the most obvious question of all, at least to any men alarmed by the development, Dr Anne Ferguson-Smith of Cambridge University moved swiftly to reassure them: 'This paper does not mean that males are obsolete - the requirement for paternal chromosomes for normal development is still with us.'

telegraph,6/5/2008 0:01,news,"            As MPs prepare to debate a Bill updating the law on embryo research, Science Editor Roger Highfield examines the complex issues at stake                                                               Have your say: Saving lives or playing God?                                             What do we mean by being human? At what point does a life wink into being? What choices can be exercised at that moment, and by whom?          Should we allow DNA from more than two people to be used to create a child? Should we allow a deaf couple to take action to ensure their son is also deaf?         These are profound issues in terms of science, law and morality - and this is why the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, due to be debated this month in Parliament, is among the most divisive to have come before MPs.          Indeed, it is so controversial that the Prime Minister has been forced to allow a free vote on the most contentious elements.         The Bill deals with experiments on the human embryo, and the way in which infertility treatments are regulated. Rationalists may claim it is simply a way for legislation to catch up with the latest scientific developments.                                              But where these fundamental issues are concerned, nothing is that simple.          The Bill's opponents, mostly from the pro-life community, say it will lead to the creation of 'monsters', and even sanctions 'the ultimate incest' - the creation of eggs and sperm from the same stem cells, which are then used to produce an embryo.          Scientists and patient groups see only the hope these technologies offer to the ill and infertile.                     As ever with legislation, the devil is in the detail. So, with the help of James Lawford Davies, a lawyer at the London-based firm Clifford Chance and lecturer in law and medicine at the Institute for Human Genetics at Newcastle University, I have taken a closer look at what exactly is proposed.         WHAT DID THE 1990 ACT DO?         The old legislation focused on human embryos, eggs and sperm, creating a body called the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to oversee the field. The aim was to allow basic research on embryos and deal with the legacy of Louise Brown, the world's first test-tube baby, who was born in 1978. Part of the reason the Act has held up well is that it was short on specifics and left detailed interpretations to the HFEA.         HOW DID IT DEFINE A HUMAN?         The old Act laid down a critical benchmark, limiting the use of embryos to those younger than 14 days old. The reason for this limit is that it is only at around 14 days that the 'primitive streak' develops - nerve tissue that is the first glimmer of the machinery of thought. The 1990 regulations also said human embryos should be used only if there is no alternative, only with consent and only in justifiable research.         SO WHY DO WE NEED TO UPDATE IT?         The 1990 Act was becoming outdated, as the HFEA struggled to accommodate new technologies. A major impetus for reform came from the development of Pre?Implantation Genetic Diagnosis in 1990.          PGD is a technique whereby a cell is removed from the early embryo and screened for faulty genes (including those for cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, haemophilia, and so on). If the cell is free of the disease gene, the embryo is implanted in the womb. The 1990 legislation applied, since PGD involves the creation and use of embryos, but it did not explicitly regulate this contentious technology.         Also, although many scientists believe the 1990 Act kept Britain at the forefront of embryo research, some doctors (notably Lord Winston and Mohamed Taranissi, the UK's most successful IVF doctor) find the HFEA secretive and bureaucratic.         WHAT WERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS?         MPs were bothered by the idea of 'saviour siblings'. These cases involved children such as Zain Hashmi, who was diagnosed with thalassaemia, and Charlie Whitaker, who had a rare form of anaemia. Their parents sought permission to use PGD to screen their embryos before having more children.          By doing this, they would ensure their new son or daughter shared their sick sibling's tissue type, and could donate cells from their umbilical cord for use in potentially life?saving transplants.         The decision to allow PGD rested on the way the HFEA interpreted the 1990 Act, and its decision to allow tissue typing was upheld by the courts. But some saw this as a step too far: the House of Commons' Science and Technology Committee claimed 'democracy is not served by unelected quangos taking decisions on behalf of Parliament'.          If MPs approve the relevant clause under a free vote on the new Bill, the technique - and existence of saviour siblings - will get statutory approval, subject to a licence from the HFEA. The danger, says Lawford Davies, is that the new Act could be too prescriptive, making legal challenges more likely and putting the legislation at risk of being overtaken by developments.         WILL THE ACT SETTLE THE DISPUTE OVER SCREENING EMBRYOS FOR DISEASE?         No. Most people would agree that if we discover genes for a serious disease within an embryo, we should not implant it: why create a child who faces only pain and suffering?          But the picture becomes more blurred with less dramatic illnesses: for example, what about an embryo that will probably develop dementia, but not for 40 years, by which time new treatments could have emerged?          Some deaf activists also object to a provision in the new Act that would ban the deliberate selection of embryos that carry disabilities - for example, by deaf parents who wanted to have a deaf child.         WHAT ABOUT CLONING?         The birth of Dolly the cloned sheep in 1996 launched a global effort to explore a new avenue of embryo research: not to create embryos for fertility treatments but to dismantle them for their stem cells, which can be turned into any of the other types of cell in the body.          'The old Act struggled to extend the meaning of a human embryo to cover cloned embryos,' says Lawford Davies, adding to the pressure for reform.         HOW ABOUT ANIMAL/HUMAN HYBRIDS?         The old Act struggled even more with 'human admixed embryos', an umbrella term for embryos that contain both human and animal material. Because human eggs are in short supply, scientists want to create embryos using animal eggs and the DNA of humans with conditions such as motor neurone disease, in order to investigate how these conditions progress and thus to develop new treatments.          There is already a judicial review under way, because pro-life groups claim that cow-human hybrids created at Newcastle University earlier this year are illegal under the 1990 legislation.         DOES THE NEW ACT DOES STOP HYBRIDS FROM ACTUALLY BEING BORN?         Yes - but this changes nothing. It is already illegal to culture any human embryos, including animal-human hybrids, for more than 14 days. It is also illegal to place hybrids in a uterus. Both laws will be retained. But that will not end the debate. Critics, particularly from the Roman Catholic Church, argue that admixed embryos are an affront to the sanctity of embryonic life.          In an effort to clarify the HFEA's remit over research involving these embryos, says Lawford Davies, 'the draft legislation creates a new category of embryo, the 'human admixed embryo'?'. This is one of the three areas on which MPs will have a free vote.         WHAT ELSE IS CONTROVERSIAL?         The third area where MPs will have their say is the 'need for a father'. Under current law, fertility clinics must consider this before giving access to IVF. In effect, doctors are being asked if children will be well looked after by their parents.          In practice, it is hard to see how they can do this, and many clinics have been happy to treat same-sex couples and single women. So while the 'need for a father' does not deny treatment to such women, the Government considers it discriminatory and wants to eliminate it.         WHAT DOES THE NEW ACT MISS OUT?         The hard sell of much embryo research is that it will lead to new cures. What is puzzling, says Lawford Davies, is that the legislation does not address how we would regulate the use of embryos in therapies for patients, as opposed to research in laboratories. British universities are spending millions on labs that can turn human embryonic stem cells into clinical-grade cells for use in therapy.          This can be done under a research licence from the HFEA, but there is no formal mechanism for it to license the use of embryos for therapies. As a result, if anyone were to develop a new therapy for a broken spinal cord or damaged brain, there is a risk of delay as the Government scratches its head over how to approve it.         COULD OTHER TREATMENTS BE SIMILARLY DELAYED?         Yes. One radical line of research that the new Bill backs is a project at Newcastle University to combine IVF with cell surgery, taking DNA from a mother and father and implanting it into an egg provided by a donor, so that the child has genetic material from three separate people.          The aim is to wipe out diseases caused by failures in the mitochondria (the energy-producing units) of cells - the equivalent of faulty batteries - which affect one in every 6,500 people and cause conditions from fatal liver failure to deafness.          But the draft Bill says that if this research is successful, Newcastle would then have to apply to the HFEA to ask the Government to license treatments, which would delay their use on patients. Also, research to turn stem cells into eggs and sperm for fertility treatment is permitted in the laboratory but banned in the clinic.         WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?         The House of Lords has passed the Bill, and the Commons will debate it this month, after which MPs will go over it in the committee stage. It is likely to become law next year                     James Lawford Davies will speak at the Cheltenham Science Festival at 99.9% Human, an exploration of the science, ethics and legal issues of so-called 'hybrid' embryos.                   James will be in discussion with Lyle Armstrong who has been granted a licence to create human-animal embryos for research, and ethicist Lord Harries of Pentregarth.

telegraph,15/08/2008 00:03,news,"            Despite a brush with cancer, at 68 Robert Winston isn't ready to retire. Here, he speaks out about IVF and the future of medicine                  Simon Gray, the playwright who died last week, described the medical profession as the 'worst health hazard'. Robert Winston - correctly, Professor the Lord Winston - isn't quite so swingeing, but for a man whose latest television series is entitled Super Doctors, he is highly critical.          Having heard the nation's best-known medic describe members of his profession as venal, arrogant and inept, I feel there should be an exclamation mark, or at least a question mark, in that title. It takes a while, however, for the full import of his words to sink in because of his cosy bedside manner.         The furrowed brow of concern rather than the blazing eye of denunciation has served him well over a 40-year career. In his avuncular way he has bullied Tony Blair into injecting more money into the health service, excoriated the BBC for all but abandoning serious programming, and revealed the red tape hampering research in this country.          This spring, he was in fine form speaking in the Lords against the inclusion in the Human Embryology and Fertility Bill of a change to the 24-week time limit for abortion. 'It's a real nonsense to have tacked it on,' he says, as usual more in sorrow than in anger. 'I feel really affronted.'         Officially, he has now retired. Aged 68, he is no longer a surgeon at Hammersmith Hospital. The only machine he now operates hisses out cappuccinos next to his desk at Imperial College London. 'Is that OK?' he asks, producing a frothy cup with the same pride with which he once delivered babies to women who had given up hope.         But Winston has never been busier, which makes his wife Lira 'furious'. In the six months since he assumed the newly created chair of Science and Society at Imperial, he has found time to practise the saxophone and clarinet but not for his rowing-machine - hence the teddy-bear tummy that he pats ruefully.         His roles include chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, chair of the Royal College of Music, presenter of television programmes including Child of our Time, and director of a research programme which, through injecting one man's sperm into another, may result in infertile men being able to father their own children.         Both his range and energy are prodigious. The night before we meet Winston has been up till 2am writing a book, yet he bounces out of bed at seven, eager for another day. Actually, he doesn't look that eager to see me because, he says, he hates talking about himself.          When he does, he is careful - almost ridiculously so - to run himself down. He could have had a huge suite of offices at Imperial, for example, but says he declined, because 'I don't deserve it'.         Maybe humility is a tenet of his Orthodox Judaism; perhaps it comes from feeling a pale imitation of his 'polymath' father - diamond cutter, violinist, bridge and chess champion, bon viveur - who died when Winston was nine, but he ducks invitations to theorise about himself.          Personal profiles and being unable to be private in public are, he says, the downsides of fame. 'I've just come back from a weekend in Sark and everyone there knew which hotel I was staying in,' he sighs.         Perhaps he should shave off the hedge that grows on his upper lip if he wishes to be anonymous? 'Ahh, but I'm quite attached to it,' he says, stroking the still-luxuriant trademark which, these days, is flecked with a little grey. Besides, it's useful being famous.         'People think I appear on television to promote my image,' Winston says. 'That's not fair. I hate filming. I turned down Strictly Come Dancing. But television is a wonderful opportunity to promote scientific ideas. Super Doctors is a very thoughtful piece. It may be the most serious programme on the BBC this year.'         Originally entitled Medical Frontiers, it looks at how the new technologies of stem cells and robotics are being used. 'The idea is not just to look at jazzy new ideas but at the dilemmas faced by doctors, and society, about how to implement those ideas. I ask if any of this technology really works.'         Winston has good reason to be sceptical about medical infallibility, having just survived a brush with cancer. Last year he noticed that a mole on his skin was growing. 'I went to see a very good dermatologist who told me that there was nothing to worry about, it was a viral infection.          Then, last August, when I was in New Zealand, it began spreading rapidly. It was several weeks before I was back and could be operated upon. Fortunately, it wasn't a melanoma. Had it been, I would have been in trouble.'         The experience also served to remind him how much patients have to put up with. 'Surgeons always underestimate the pain and disability involved in what they do to people. My surgeon had to take off a considerable amount of skin. It's only now, nine months later, that I've got the feeling back and the swelling has gone down. No one ever tells you that.'         The skin cancer was on his shin. Hidden away under his trousers, I can't imagine it ever sees much sun unless he toasts it under a lamp. He nods. 'This won't be very popular with Cancer Research UK, but there is some doubt whether sunbathing makes a massive difference. We may be overplaying the role of the sun.'         Apparent medical certainties, Winston explains, may have more to do with doctors building reputations or making money than real evidence. So, despite his wife's pleas, he doesn't bother with screening to see whether he is about to keel over from a heart attack.         'The evidence for preventative medicine of that sort is quite dubious, except in certain areas.          It just about seems to work with smears for cervical cancer, but Michael Baum says it is not so helpful with breast cancer. [Professor Baum, pioneer of Britain's £75 million screening-programme, has said that in some cases false alarms and over-treatment may even outweigh the benefit of early diagnosis.] In my case it would be more effective to be careful about what I eat and take more exercise. But I love food... I also like alcohol.'         From an early age, Winston had reason to question doctors' godlike wisdom, having watched his father die, aged 42, after a 'medical cock-up'. 'He had an infection which turned into pneumonia.          He was given antibiotics, but too little, too late and he was discharged from hospital too quickly. I have vivid memories of my mother changing his dressings in the dining room: there were tubes everywhere. He developed an abscess on the brain, was operated on and died 10 days later.'         A desire to do medicine better might explain why Winston chose the profession over the diplomatic service, which his mother thought might suit her son, who was gifted at English. As usual with anything personal, he rejects a psychological analysis, saying that, from the age of seven, he wanted to study science, which he read at Cambridge, then shifted to medicine for the human contact.          Finding it 'rigid and authoritarian' he gave up for a while to direct plays.          Returning to medicine, he was 'lucky' to find himself in obstetrics and gynaecology at Hammersmith Hospital, a field which looked so unpromising in the Seventies that his boss referred to the fertility clinic as the 'futility' clinic.          'I was too arrogant to realise that IVF was going to be as useful as it has been. The tubal surgery we were doing [to unblock fallopian tubes] was wonderfully successful - and still is more successful than IVF - but nobody is doing it any more.'         Why not? 'IVF is very commercial. The people doing it are among the best- paid in medicine: they charge a lot per treatment and it's not in their interest to make it more effective. Having people fail means that they come back again.'         Winston was not part of this plot to exploit infertile couples because private practice was frowned on at Hammersmith Hospital where he, and others, focused on research - but surely he should have spoken out?         'Two years ago, when I was making Child Against All the Odds, the BBC said it didn't want me to raise these issues,' he says sheepishly.         With this latest series he is being more courageous. One programme shows a ward round conducted by a Dalek connected to health minister Lord Darzi four miles away. 'Robots may cut down on infection and mean a consultant can see more patients, but wouldn't you rather meet the doctor than a machine?' asks Winston.         The programme also shows a £12 million robot doing an operation, but the surgeon switches to doing it by hand as that's more efficient. It raises the question of whether such vast sums might be better spent on increasing access to treatments that are known to work.         'When we talked about how stem cells were going to revolutionise medicine, as we did about the genome, we raised expectations beyond what we can deliver,' he says. ''It's arrogance.          When the previous director of the Wellcome Trust said of the genome project that it was more important than the invention of the wheel, I think the wheel has helped an awful lot of people and I don't think the genome project has, yet. It might do. We need to be much more responsible in what we say.'         I would love to read a book in which Winston pulls together his thoughts on medicine, politics, science, religion and the arts - and also reveals more about himself. He says he isn't going to write an autobiography. 'Christ, no. I couldn't afford to be truthful. All of us have a very dark side, so it would have to be superficial.' Intriguing, but perhaps it's just that he prefers to keep busy addressing questions piecemeal through programmes, talks and - despite his reservations - interviews.         It would be a pity if he weren't fit enough to keep doing this for a long time to come, so I hope he finds time for the rowing machine.         • 'Super Doctors' starts on BBC1 on Thursday at 9pm"
telegraph,20/07/2006 00:01,news,"            FOR                   Scientists believe stem cells offer the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells and tissues to treat everything from Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and diabetes to strokes, spinal cord injury and infertility.          Dr Sophie Petit-Zeman of the Association of Medical Research Charities, said: 'Research using embryonic stem cells offers real hope for understanding and potentially alleviating serious conditions. We recognise the important ethical issues which surround this, while also acknowledging the moral and scientific imperative to do everything possible to promote research methods which can help millions of people who are now or may become ill.'                      AGAINST                   Some are opposed to the destruction of an embryo to extract stem cells on the grounds that this involves the loss of a potential human life. The Vatican has warned that Roman Catholic scientists who carry out embryonic stem cell and politicians who pass laws allowing it will be excommunicated.          Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo, head of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said last month: 'Destroying human embryos is equivalent to an abortion. It is the same thing. Excommunication will be applied to the women, doctors and researchers who eliminate embryos [and to the] politicians that approve the law.'          Some scientists have warned that exaggerated claims made about the potential benefits of stem cell therapy could lead to a public backlash.          Prof Robert Winston last year outlined a series of technical difficulties such as the slow replication of stem cells in the laboratory and the possibility of faster growing, but abnormal, cells dominating lab cultures."
telegraph,3/1/2005 0:01,news,"            From stem cell breakthroughs to new ways to beat wrinkles, Christine Doyle looks at the health trends that are set to improve our lives in 2005                              The importance of a good night's sleep                   Expect to hear much more in 2005 about the value of a good night's sleep to 'wake up' your mind and increase your brain power. Already, the concept of the mind gym is becoming popular, with psychologists offering corporate training in how to improve brain function.                       Sleep deprivation causes changes in the brain that are almost identical to those that occur naturally in people in their seventies and eighties, according to research by Professor Jim Horne, who heads the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University.           'These changes, which are in the hardworking frontal part of the brain's cortex, affect decision-making and the ability to absorb and adapt to new information. People who are affected tend to talk more in clichés and become more rigid in their thinking,' says Prof Horne, whose book on the subject will be published later this year. 'A tired junior doctor at the end of a long shift, for example, could be in danger of making a mistake, if faced with unexpected symptoms that stretch his deductive powers.'          For young people, a good night's sleep will restore the brain to full power, and Horne thinks it is a key responsibility of employers to ensure that their staff do not work exhaustively long hours. Even a power nap in a workplace sleep zone – an American idea that is on its way here – could help in a crisis.                      Build up brain power                   Prof Horne's research has uncovered good news for those worried about declining brain power. You don't have to 'use it or lose it' by reading weighty, intellectual books or doing crosswords.           'The answer is to stimulate the brain by bombarding it with interesting information. Have fun sightseeing, go to art galleries and the theatre, travel, surf the net, window-shop and talk about what interests you.          'The latest idea is that other parts of the brain take over from the declining frontal cortex during sleep to reorganise the fresh information gathered during the day. New neural connections are forged, we believe, during the first few hours of deep sleep.'                      Look after the heart                   This year will bring a Europe-wide drive to encourage people to reduce their cholesterol and blood pressure levels, according to Professor John Martin, director of the centre for cardiovascular biology and medicine at University College London.           'The aim is to develop a heart plan to reduce everyone's cholesterol level to below the present average of just above five units per litre of blood.'           At least one third of the population has been diagnosed with high blood pressure or levels at the high end of normal.           'The Irish government and the European Society of Cardiology [ESC] are co-operating with EU ministers on how this plan might work,' says Prof Martin, who is chairman of the EU relations committee of the ESC.           For GPs, who are already weary of trying to achieve targets, the idea might sound alarming but, says Prof Martin, 'we don't want to tell people what to do; we want to establish guidelines. Some countries might mount healthier eating and exercise campaigns, others might encourage doctors to use their influence with patients by taking a more active role in testing and advising. Reducing the numbers affected by heart disease, strokes and adult onset diabetes continues to be the key public health issue.'                      A pill for your ears                   Progress is expected this year in developing a pill to protect ears against induced hearing loss. Loud music, noisy occupations and some drugs, including those used to treat cancer, can damage cells in the sound-sensitive hairs of the ear canal.           'We are very excited by the development and hope to hear soon about the results of clinical trials in America,' says a spokesman for the Royal National Institute for the Deaf.                      Complementary medicine closes the gap                   'Complementary medicine is reaching a turning point in its relationship with mainstream medicine,' says George Lewith, a GP and senior research fellow at Southampton University who straddles both worlds. 'One in 10 people use it and about half of those are lifelong users. Now, the latest scientifically based studies provide convincing evidence that therapies do work.'                      Trials with Chinese acupuncture showed that it significantly reduces the pain of osteoarthritis and improves mobility. 'Confidence in the findings is attracting new research money, including grants from the Department of Health,' says Lewith.          This year, he expects good news for people who take glucosamine to keep their knee and hip joints supple. 'The studies will prove that consistently taking between 1.2 and 1.5 g a day reduces the need for a hip or knee replacement in those with established osteoarthritis.'                      Stem cell tissue repair                   Stem cell research is keeping both medics and patients in suspense. Stem cells are those extracted from tissues that have the potential to grow into new cells in other tissues. The growth of such cells could help those with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's. They might even help to restore vision and cure diabetes. Japanese doctors are conducting studies using stem and fat cells to reconstruct breasts, in the hope that they might be used after breast cancer.           'During 2005,' says Prof Martin, 'we expect to start a trial using stem cells extracted from the patient's own bone marrow to repair damaged blood vessels or other tissues following a heart attack.           'Studies in Germany show the procedure is safe, but we do not yet know how the stem cells work.'                      Valentine's heart-to-heart                   After years spent urging us to look after our health to minimise the risk of suffering a heart attack, the British Heart Foundation will take a new tack this year. Its Valentine's Day campaign is called 'Living with Heart Failure', in recognition of the fact that many who survive heart disease may later develop heart failure. Finding a drug or technique to prevent this complication is high on the research agenda, says the BHF.           For more information, see: www.bhf.org.uk                               Holistic fitness          If you depend on workouts to give you mental and physical energy but are becoming bored with gym sessions, what are the new options?          'We will see a more natural and holistic approach, with an emphasis on outdoor activities that get people together,' says personal trainer Matt Roberts.           'There will be a push towards trail running, which is a wonderful activity – a favourite of Robbie Williams. You put work out of your mind and run, at your own pace, up and down mountain and hill trails, along river banks or through woodlands, parks or fields. Instead of focusing on timing, you take in your environment and are not so breathless that you cannot speak to your companions.' It is acceptable to slow down or even walk some of the time.          Roberts also forecasts a surge of interest in triathlon events. 'These involve stints of swimming, cycling and running, pitched at all levels. For those looking for something beyond road and marathon running, they offer a stimulating alternative.'           For more information, see: www.britishtriathlon.org                   Trail Running Association: www.tra-uk.org                               Cat allergy vaccine                   This summer, a vaccine that helps people who are allergic to cats will be tested. Thousands of adults are affected and the symptoms of about half of the 1.5 million asthmatic children in Britain are triggered by cats.          'This is the first cat allergy vaccine to get close to commercial production,' says Dr Mark Larché of the Imperial College of Medicine, London.           'About 60 people will take part in the trials, which will take about 18 months. I am confident that the vaccine will live up to its promise. It works by making the immune system more tolerant to the antigen in cats' saliva. If successful, we should be able to apply the same principle against the house dustmite.'                      The pharmacy: first stop for a health check                   More pharmacists will offer an increasing range of health check-ups, including blood pressure and cholesterol monitoring. Many are also liaising more closely with primary care trusts to provide appropriate checks.           From March, free leg scans will be offered nationwide at large pharmacies. Nurses will carry out leg examinations and show people how to spot signs of disease, such as varicose veins and swollen legs and ankles, and how to avoid deep vein thrombosis.          For details of your nearest pharmacy, tel: 08450 606707                      More drugs over the counter                   When Zocor, a statin that helps lower cholesterol levels, became available at chemist's without a doctor's prescription last year, not all doctors approved. But many saw it as part of a move to give patients greater choice and autonomy, and expand the role of pharmacists as advisers.          Chloramphenicol antibiotic eye drops, which are used to treat conjunctivitis, are next in line for over-the-counter sales. They are safe and effective, and this decision will make it much easier for patients to get treatment as soon as they need it. Other drugs under consideration include those for asthma, raised blood pressure and obesity.                      Intelligent hip replacement                    A 'smart' hip replacement joint with tiny surface sensors that detect and identify the bacteria involved in infection following surgery is being developed at the Allegheny Singer Research Institute in Pittsburgh.           The hip would release an antibiotic from a tiny internal supply, and report on the control of infection via a wireless link. This system would eradicate the need for the distressing removal and subsequent replacement of a new hip in up to three per cent of hip replacement patients. It might prove costly, though, for the NHS.                      Alzheimer's drug to ease Parkinson's disease                   Trials using Exelon, an Alzheimer's drug, suggest it might slow late-stage dementia in some of those suffering from advanced Parkinson's. 'The drug could help carers to cope more easily, though it is not yet licensed for this use,' says a spokesman for the Parkinson's Disease Society.                      Natural treatment to smooth wrinkles                   Keep an eye out in the spring for Evolence, a new, so-called natural injection to beat wrinkles. It is said to be long-lasting, and the developers are keeping the details a close secret. It is bound to be expensive.                      Campaigns against smoking                   Expect a hard-hitting government campaign this spring, urging smokers to be alert to developing a smoker's cough. It can be the prelude to chronic lung disease and is a potential sign of lung cancer.           There will also be a renewed effort by Action on Smoking and Health, the British Lung Foundation and the British Medical Association to persuade the Government to legislate for a total ban on smoking in public places, as in Ireland, rather than the present proposals, which permit some exceptions."

'We are going to have a big fight with Celltech and I think we'll win,' he said. Days later Evans backed away from the deal, leaving Celltech to gobble up the prize.          However, true to form, he tells The Sunday Telegraph he is not a bit embarrassed about the bid flop. And as for his ensuing silence, he explains that he has been busy restructuring Merlin Biosciences, the venture capital firm he launched in 1996, and that until now he has been reluctant to talk about it.          Many of the 28 companies in which Merlin has invested are loss-making. They are also hungry for new injections of cash. To complicate matters, Merlin has been struggling to raise a €250m investment fund, which was originally supposed to close early in 2003. And there have been a string of high-profile departures from Merlin.          But it hasn't all been bad news. Ark Therapeutics, a Merlin-backed business, finally made it to the stock market earlier this month, giving Evans and his team an urgently needed fillip. In its second attempt at a stock market listing, Ark floated at a market capitalisation of £170m on March 3, raising £55m.          Evans does not downplay the achievement. 'No venture capitalists in biotech have exited anything of any decent value in the last three-and-a-half years, so anyone would be opening champagne. It was really important and Merlin was very pleased,' he says.          Ark may have been the first biotech float for years, but will it succeed in the long term? The shares have already dipped below the 133p opening price, but - unsurprisingly - Evans is confident the stock will soar. 'Ark's got way more cash than it needs to reach profitability and there is a lot of [good] news flow to come over the next two years. So with a bit of luck you are going to see the stock price perform,' he says.          On the other hand, Ark is understood to have attracted the interest of hedge fund investors. If they are bearish on the company's prospects, they could short the stock, in anticipation of profiting from a falling share price. Such a move could precipitate a vicious downward spiral in the shares.          Like most biotech companies, the risks are that its mind-boggling science is never translated into a commercial success. The company has four products close to being launched on the market. One of these is a gene therapy product for brain cancer. Yet no gene therapy product has ever been approved, anywhere in the world, for any illness.          Anyway, Evans needs to reassure investors that Ark is just the beginning of a long line of Merlin-backed flotations. Other Merlin companies are being lined up for the public markets in the next year to 18 months. These include Cyclacel, Microscience, Vectura, Ardana, Arakis and Intercytex.          On the other hand, many investment institutions remain wary of the biotechnology sector. Britain's quoted biotechnology sector is ragged. Only a tiny minority of companies produce revenues and even fewer have ever made a profit.          Jeremy Curnock-Cook, the chairman of Bioscience Managers, an investment advisory firm, says: 'We do not have the support of the long-term financial institutions for high-tech companies seeking flotations at the moment. When will that change? When they can make money out of it. And it will take quite a lot for them to forget the problems of the past.'          The UK is probably many years from producing a company capable of rivalling the US biotech giants such as Amgen, Biogen or Genentech. In fact, Evans thinks it never will. 'The UK has to accept its size limitations,' he says. 'The volume of money in the UK is vastly smaller and we don't have a stock exchange as liquid or as ambitious and adventurous as Nasdaq.'          So Merlin is taking a conservative approach, building companies with products in clinical trials which have identifiable markets and proven management. 'People want to see these sorts of businesses being brought to the stock markets,' he insists. 'I think the sector will be re-established with a more asset-driven, revenue-driven and more conservative base to it than the US. That is what British investors want to see.'          But there is still one impediment: Merlin needs to throw lots of cash at these businesses to get them into shape. Evans's latest fund is thought to have closed having raised a little over €200m. While this is short of its original target and took longer to garner than was originally hoped, Evans believes the worst is behind him.          'Unfortunately we went fundraising in 2002, which was bang in the middle of about the worst period in the history of biotech,' he says. 'We found that investors wanted a shorter-term exit horizon, so they wanted Merlin to be backing nearer-term companies, rather than start-ups.'          This prompted Evans to set about reconstructing Merlin. 'We have reshaped our team at Merlin and that's finished,' he says. Evans says he has replaced a number of Merlin's boffins with bankers. 'Suddenly I had companies going full throttle towards big commercial deals, IPOs, mergers or trade sales. So I needed people around me who were cold, calculating, financial, ruthless, transactional people,' he says.          He says he has replaced around eight of his scientific analysts with corporate finance experts. Yet this does not really explain the departure of Peter Keen, a finance expert who was once considered Evans's right-hand man. He decided to move to a consultancy role about a year ago.          Sue Foden, another senior executive, has also taken a back seat role. Foden ran Cancer Research Campaign Ventures, which looked at commercial opportunities to raise cash for the charity. So her strengths can hardly be said to be purely scientific. And in December Andrew Greene, formerly an investment banker at Merrill Lynch, departed.          So the past year has been testing for Evans. Has the Merlin magician emerged more or less powerful? It's obvious what he would say."
telegraph,8/6/2005 0:01,technology,"            Research by a Cambridge scientist could provide clues to how the human body develops. Roger Highfield reports                  It is the greatest mystery in biology: how does a newly fertilised egg divide again and again to create a mind-bogglingly complex community of 200 or more different cell types, about 10,000 trillion in all, that is capable of reading this sentence?          The broad outline of your origins is simple enough. Egg and sperm came together, the resulting embryo started dividing and two cells became four, four became eight and so on. Around 50 cell divisions later, you end up with a person.          From the alpha of the fertilised egg to the omega of a fully grown adult, cells develop distinctive character. This process, called differentiation, means you are standing on cells that you would have used for thinking had they developed elsewhere.          Now the equivalent of north and south 'poles' in the early embryo have been revealed in painstaking experiments by Dr Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz and her team at the Gurdon Institute in Cambridge, a finding that questions textbook wisdom and, like any challenge to dogma, has been greeted with scepticism by some rivals.          A decade of studies on mice by Dr Zernicka-Goetz's team at the institute, named after the pioneer of cloning and development, Sir John Gurdon, reveals that cells in the embryo become predisposed to follow a developmental path much earlier than thought. This could have implications for efforts to grow embryo stem cells to treat major diseases, to diagnose hereditary disorders in IVF embryos and understand the fundamentals of human development.          Eggs are unlike other cells, in that they are frozen in the act of dividing their DNA from a full set of chromosomes to half a set. When a wriggling sperm penetrates the zona pellucida, the rubbery shell around the much larger egg, it completes the recipe of an individual by adding another half set of chromosomes.          The moment the sperm enters, it sends a shock wave of calcium through the egg that launches a new life. Unwanted chromosomes are ejected in a little cell called the polar body, which has no biological future. The remaining chromosomes organise into a ball-like structure called a pronucleus. At the same time, the sperm forms another pronucleus.          This might surprise those who think a new life begins on fertilisation: in the sense that an individual is a blend of parental DNA, one has yet to be born - the mixing of genes from mother and father is not completed until after the first cell division.          The egg also strips the sperm DNA of molecular tags, called methyl groups, that control which genes are turned off and which on (this has been exploited to clone creatures such as Dolly the sheep by nuclear transfer).          These patterns in methylation - called epigenetic modifications - are the reason that cells in the body can have the same DNA and yet a muscle cell be different from a nerve cell. By removing the tags, the developmental clock is reset to zero and the early embryo has the potential to make any cell in the body by laying down new epigenetic patterns.          After five or so days, a cavity forms inside the ball of glassy cells and inflates with fluid, so that it is almost hollow, ready to hatch from the zona and attach to the uterus. Biologists call it a 'blastocyst'. Lurking inside is the 'inner cell mass', and it is from this cluster that a person grows - these are the stem cells that give birth to every cell in the body.          These are much sought after, since they offer the prospect of understanding and treating major diseases. The rest of the blastocyst's cells build the plumbing between embryo and womb.          Dr Zernicka-Goetz has painted in new details. Four years ago, she used green fluorescent beads to mark the entry point of the sperm. After the encounter, the egg becomes slightly oval, as if its suitor has squashed it. Under blue light, bright green spots revealed that the egg's short axis always passes through the sperm's entry point. The embryo divides into two cells - on the long axis of the elongated egg - then four, then eight and so on, initially staying the same size.          A member of Dr Zernicka-Goetz's team, Karolina Piotrowska, then found a way to 'paint' the cells in the two-cell embryo to reveal their fate. By marking the cell's 'skeleton' green, the fibres that move things around in cells red, and DNA blue, the resulting kaleidoscope of colour surprised the team by showing that the first cell division, cleaving the fertilised mouse egg in two, is not random but predictable.          'The first division normally cleaves the egg through its short axis and so relates to the flattening of the egg that occurs on sperm entry,' said Dr Zernicka-Goetz. 'I was shocked to see a pattern and so surprised that I did not want to publish these findings at first.'          Between the fertilised egg and the growth of the blastocyst, the early embryo was thought to consist of identical cells. This is backed by the knowledge that by splitting a four-cell embryo into two two-cell embryos, and then implanting them in a womb, two mice can result (this is how twins - nature's clones - result).          But the early cells are not necessarily identical, according to Dr Zernicka-Goetz. Her team has shown that each of the four cells appears to be aware of its destiny, though it is not fixed, as hinted at by earlier work in Japan. Of the tiny pyramid of cells, one appears to be predisposed - depending on its environment - to contribute more than the other three to the link between mother and embryo proper, rather than the embryo itself.          She showed this in an experiment that exploited a technique developed by her former supervisor at the University of Warsaw, Prof Andrzej Tarkowski. In what he called a crazy experiment, he found that development could continue after he had mixed cells from different embryos to create a chimera.          To examine the developmental potential of the early embryo, Dr Zernicka-Goetz's team took four embryos at the four-cell stage and conducted a gruelling series of experiments, each taking 20 hours. They labelled each cell A, B, C and D, separated them and blended them to create four new embryos, each consisting of only one kind of cell, all A, all B, all C or all D. They did this repeatedly over two years.          Textbook dogma would say the chimeras all had the same potential to develop into a mouse. They did not. Two types developed perfectly, one showed developmental abnormalities and one failed to develop at all - the latter probably being made of cells destined to be the placenta. Even when an embryo consists of just four cells, they are beginning to assert their own identity: there is a 'north' and 'south' pole.          There could be important implications, according to the IVF pioneer Robert Edwards, who has gathered circumstantial evidence that the same might be true for human embryos. In the technique of Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD), genetic and chromosomal disorders are diagnosed before IVF by removing cells from an early embryo. Edwards, with other researchers, is worried that removal of the wrong cells could harm the ability of the embryo to develop.          'The work of Dr Zernicka-Goetz is fantastic,' added Prof Stéphane Viville a PGD expert at the Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire in Strasbourg. Although he agrees it could have implications for PGD, he points out that two cells are usually removed at random from an eight-cell embryo for analysis and his experiments provide indirect evidence that the embryo does not seem greatly disturbed. In the Cambridge lab, single-cell biopsies also seem to have little effect, boosting confidence that PGD should be unaffected - so long as what goes for mice is true for men.          But the work of Dr Zernicka-Goetz's team has wider implications and is turning into one of the most contentious topics in the field. A pioneer of nuclear transfer and epigenetics, Professor Davor Solter of the Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology, Freiburg, has questioned some of their findings with his colleague Dr Takashi Hiiragi.          They, too, have observed the earliest stages of life in various ways, including time-lapse photography, which suggest the embryos 'spin like yo-yos' within their rubbery shells, making it hard to track individual cells. 'We got totally different results,' said Dr Hiiragi. They have not found a pattern in the first division, believing it occurs at random, and doubt cells in an early embryo differ. However, they cannot prove this because they have not made chimeras of the four cell types.          To address the sceptics, the Cambridge team has once again shown a pattern of early development, tracking the choreography of cells in three dimensions. Most important, it has uncovered a tantalising hint of differences between the four cells in the ways their genes blink on and off. If confirmed, this discovery could end the debate.          These studies might provide clues to the origins of embryonic stem cells, the parents of all cell types in the body, which will be a boon for those who want to use them to study disease. As well as helping to identify and isolate cell types more easily, the research could aid efforts to find ways to turn one type into another without the need to use cloning to grow a patient's own cells.          To be able to convert a skin cell into a nerve or heart cell by adding a cocktail of factors would allow doctors to grow a patient's replacement tissues without cloned embryos, the Holy Grail of stem-cell research.

telegraph,30/11/2007 19:00,news,"            Roger Highfield reports that the alternative to cloning continues to show promise                        Skin cells from the face of 36 year old woman have been converted into her own embryonic like cells directly, in experiments that bring closer the day that doctors will not need to clone embryos to create any of a patient's own cells and tissues for novel treatments.                                                      Dolly creator Prof Ian Wilmut shuns cloning                                                                        Ian Wilmut: My life with Dolly the diva                                                                        Have you say: Can cloning ever be ethical?                                              In an advance that will calm ethical concerns, transform stem-cell research and accelerate progress toward treating patients with their own personalised replacement cells and tissue, American and Japanese researchers reported a few days ago they have reprogrammed ordinary human skin cells to behave like embryonic stem cells, a remarkable advance that prompted Prof Ian Wilmut to say he would adopt the new method rather than the one his team used to clone Dolly.          By inserting four key genes into adult cells, the scientists created a form of stem cell that can grow into virtually any kind of tissue - a feat that previously required destroying embryos to extract cells. The discovery may clear a path for researchers to produce stem cells more easily and without embryo destruction, which is bitterly opposed by pro life groups.          But one of the genes the Japanese team used in the new method is also an oncogene, meaning it has been linked with certain types of cancer. And although a rival American group in Wisconsin avoided using that gene, they used cells from a newborn rather than an adult.          Now the Japanese team led by Prof Shinya Yamanaka and colleagues at Kyoto University show in the journal Nature Biotechnology how to convert adult human skin cells into cells that resemble embryonic stem cells without using the tumour-causing gene c-Myc.          Prof Yamanaka achieved the feat with just three genes and, in rodent experiments, blended the resulting embryonic like cells into mouse embryos. None of the 26 animals derived this way from cells made without c-Myc died of tumours (after 100 days), whereas six of 37 animals from the embryo like cells made with c-Myc did, showing that the absence of c-Myc reduces tumour incidence.          Dr Lyle Armstrong, from the  International Centre For Life, Newcastle University, commented: 'This new paper demonstrates that one of the more controversial reprogramming factors (c-myc) is not absolutely necessary to produce iPS (embryo like) cells which gives us hope that methods may be developed soon that produce cells which can be used in human patients. However, there is still much work to be done.'          Scientists still need to devise ways to transform adult into embryo cells without the need for viruses, which are currently used to introduce the genes to reprogramme the cells and can in theory disrupt other genes.          Prof Robin Lovell Badge of the National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, said that it is important that the Wisconsin work has been verified by the Japanese, though he added that there are still issues regarding how efficient the method is when fewer genes are used. 'As always, many more questions are raised than are answered.'          Dr Anna Krassowska, research manager a the UK Stem Cell Foundation, said: 'The present study is a continuation of Yamanaka's recent work that contributes to our understanding of the basic science of cellular reprogramming, while also addressing one of the important issues to be tackled for this technology to be useful for medical research.'"
telegraph,13/02/2007 00:01,news,"            That is the implication of a new study of mice, reports Roger Highfield                   Cells at the base of a plucked hair are twice as easy to use to create clones as the cells that are used in traditional approaches, according to a study carried out on mice.               However, this advantage is only enjoyed by males, not females, according to research that suggests that men may be intrinsically less difficult to clone than women.            The cells found at the base of the hair are adult stem cells and may provide a promising new source of cloning material for creating much more flexible embryonic stem cells, which scientists worldwide are studying as possible treatments for a vast range of diseases since they have the ability to turn into all 200 types in the body.           An American team reports that it has succeeded  in cloning healthy mice from adult stem cells from the skin - which have a more limited repertoire than embryonic stem cells - and are the first team to manage to do this.           But the catch was that the process was only more efficient when cloning male mice, so men are the most likely to benefit from  this advance if it is ever translated into human medicine.           Typically, only two per cent of cloned mouse embryos implanted into a surrogate mother result in a live birth if the traditional Dolly cloning method is used. Profs Elaine Fuchs and Peter Mombaerts from The Rockefeller University, New York, report a success rate of more than five per cent when using adult stem cells from male mice in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.           Prof Mombaerts said that earlier work suggested that cloning may be easier when DNA from male cells - such as those from the testes and the tail - is implanted into eggs. 'Few cloning studies have compared, side by side, the same cell type in males versus females. Maybe our paper will spur interest in this issue.'            'The difference in cloning rates of male and female stem cells seems likely to involve epigenetics,' said Prof Fuchs said. Epigenetic modifications  are those that affect a gene's function without altering its DNA  sequence.           Because one of a female's two X chromosomes (men only have one) is turned off through  epigenetic modifications, female cells have to undergo a more complicated epigenetic reprogramming than male ones and this may account for why males are easier to clone. "
telegraph,12/2/2008 0:01,news,"            The day when babies can be made from stray flakes of skin may not be far away. But the ethical implications are enormous, says Roger Highfield                  When the Prime Minister walks out of the press conference, he leaves a single flake of skin on the lectern. A woman quietly picks it up, takes it to a lab and, nine months later, gives birth to his child.         This might seem like a fantasy but is no longer beyond the bounds of possibility, according to Anna Smajdor, an ethicist at the University of East Anglia who is pondering the implications of methods under development to create eggs and sperm in the laboratory.         The direct applications seem straightforward. The creation of 'artificial gametes' will help us understand how the real things are made, shedding light on the causes of infertility and raising the hope that sterile men and women could one day have biological children.         But there are other, stranger implications, which Smajdor will try to spell out at a public discussion with other experts tonight at the Centre for Life in Newcastle, organised by the Progress Educational Trust.          'If sperm and eggs can be created from stray skin cells, people's control over their reproductive choices is dramatically altered,' she says. 'A woman could simply pick up a bit of bodily detritus, take it to a laboratory, and give birth to the genetic child of Sir Richard Branson.'         As Parliament debates changes to the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, the Government is under pressure to include an amendment to allow the use of eggs and sperm that have been grown in the lab from stem cells.          One clause would restrict this to sperm from genetic (XY) males and eggs from genetic (XX) females, reflecting the disquiet many feel over aspects of this reproductive revolution, notably the prospect of self-reproduction or gay couples having biological children.         'What has been termed 'reprogrammable biology' gives us the capacity to make cells act in new ways, blurring what we mean by an egg or sperm, or even embryo,' says Smajdor.          'The boundaries between these categories have become very fluid, with the development of techniques that allow us to alter their genetic make-up or prompt them to behave in new ways. This raises very perplexing questions about ethics, law and regulation.'         According to Donald Bruce of Edinethics, an independent consultancy in ethics and technology, who is also speaking at the debate, most religions would welcome ways of giving infertile men and women a possibility to produce sperm and eggs, although they might object if making gametes involved destroying human embryos.          However, he says, 'a wider problem arises if this is to be taken beyond the narrow medical sphere of infertility and we seek to do things that are hitherto biologically impossible. The more we atomise the reproductive process into its components, the more we miss major questions about intimate human relationships.'         As well as prompting vigorous ethical debate, the research has triggered a row among scientists about the extent to which human reproduction can be altered.          All agree that men should be capable of producing eggs: although this would not be plain sailing (there is a risk of chromosomal abnormalities), the fact that men have an X chromosome, like women, should make it possible.          Thus male gay couples could, with the help of a surrogate mother, have their own biological baby. But things are more complicated when it comes to women becoming fathers: some scientists believe that the Y (male) chromosome is so important to sperm that attempts to use female cells will be doomed.         The choice of venue for tonight's discussion is very appropriate because Newcastle is at the cutting edge of efforts to turn immature cells from bone marrow or embryos, called stem cells, into eggs and sperm.          Prof Karim Nayernia, professor of stem cell biology at the city's university, has already coaxed male bone marrow cells to develop into primitive sperm cells, and has repeated the feat with female embryonic stem cells.          He plans to apply for permission to turn the bone marrow cells of a woman into sperm.         This work raises the possibility of lesbian couples having children: sperm created from the bone marrow of one woman could be used to fertilise an egg from her partner.          But there are some hurdles to jump, says Dr Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell expert at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill, London.         Prof Nayernia may have created immature, tailless sperm (at least, his creations are thought to be precursors of sperm, because they are decorated with similar molecules), but they have not undergone a process called meiosis, which ensures they have the right amount of genetic material for fertilisation.          Because eggs and sperm come together to create an embryo, they need to start out with half the normal complement of genetic material each.          'The presence of two X chromosomes is incompatible with this,' says Dr Lovell-Badge, who is convinced that Prof Nayernia's plan will not work. 'Moreover, they need genes from the Y chromosome to go through meiosis. So they are double-damned.'          But Prof Nayernia cites the work of Prof Jonathan Tilly at Massachusetts General Hospital, who is trying to sidestep the 'meiosis block'.         There is, however, another hurdle: we inherit our genes from both parents, but there are 'imprinted' genes where we use just the father's or the mother's DNA.          There are worries that this could undermine attempts to get a man to make eggs or a woman to make sperm.         But on one point, everyone can agree: as Peter Nagy, scientific director of Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta, says, for women to father children and men to make eggs would be as significant a breakthrough as the birth of the first test tube baby 30 years ago - and one whose implications would be just as profound."
telegraph,7/11/2006 0:01,news,"            Why do scientists want to create hybrid animal-human embryos?                  Human eggs are in short supply — being also in demand for fertility treatment — and are expensive, costing about £3,000 per woman. Moreover, the procedure carries risks. Rabbit or cow eggs would enable scientists to do basic stem cell research more cheaply and safely.                      How will it be done?                   The animal egg will be emptied of its nuclear DNA and fused with DNA from a human cell, as was done with Dolly the sheep, or fused with an entire human cell. The latter method will mean that human DNA will also replace the second type of DNA — that in power plants of cells, called mitochondria — to some extent so that the resulting cloned embryos are even more human.                      Has this been done before?                   Yes. This method has been pioneered by Dr Hui Zhen Sheng's team at the Shanghai Second Medical University, China, where she fused human cells with rabbit eggs to produce early stage embryos, which in turn yielded human stem cells.                      What is the result?                   These embryos have only one type of nuclear DNA and are called hybrids or 'cybrids.'                      Is the Chinese work convincing?                   Yes. Dr Sheng's team used donor cells from the foreskins of a five-year-old boy and two men, and facial tissue from a woman. They fused the nuclei (containing DNA) of the human cells with rabbit eggs from which they had removed the nuclei. The resulting embryos were dismantled and used to derive six lines of stem cells, flexible cells that can develop into any type.                      Is this regulated?                   The use of cybrids is 'a grey area' in terms of current regulations, which are under review. The work raises a basic question — if you take a human nucleus and put it in a rabbit egg, is it a human embryo? Whatever, it is still counted as a human embryo by the fertility watchdog, the HFEA.                      So why not use hybrid cells to repair patients?                   They would not be used for stem cell treatments of patients because of concerns about disease and because cybrid cells may still contain rabbit DNA in mitochondria, the 'batteries' of the cell. The few rabbit genes present may generate proteins that would be attacked by the human immune system, for example.                      Will the cells of the hybrids have other benefits?                   Yes. Although cybrid stem cells could not be used for treatments and will not be allowed to develop beyond an early stage, they will prove invaluable for studies of how to clone embryonic stem cells more efficiently — so human eggs could eventually be used — and could be used to test drugs on cell lines created from people with Alzheimer's disease, and shed light on the basic disease process.

telegraph,7/8/2008 17:03,news,"A 'disease in a dish' method has been used on patients with 10 serious disorders to boost worldwide efforts to find new treatments.                                                      Patient's own cells mass produced for first time in lab                                                                        Woman's skin turned to embryo cells                                             American researchers have used a Japanese technique to turn cells from people with different diseases into stem cells with the same genetic errors.         Stem cells, which can be grown indefinitely in the lab, have the ability to grow into the 200 plus cell types found in the human body, from muscle to heart to brain cell.         They say these cell lines can be used to mimic human disease more reliably than mice and other animal models and will be a boon for efforts to find new treatments.         They will it possible for researchers to explore the 10 different disorders - including muscular dystrophy, juvenile diabetes, bubble baby immune disorder, Down syndrome and Parkinson's disease - in a variety of cell and tissue types as they develop in laboratory cultures.         These, in turn, can be used to test new drugs, for instance on stem cell derived pancreas cells that are affected by juvenile diabetes.         These newly-created stem cells, which were created without the controversial step of making human embryos, will allow researchers to mimic tissue formation in a Petri dish as it occurs in individuals with any of the ten diseases, a vast improvement over current technology. But it could be extended to many more diseases.         The feat is reported in the journal Cell by Prof George Daley, who is at Children's Hospital Boston. He worked with researchers from Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the University of Washington.         The scientists hope to make the cell lines available to scientists worldwide on a not for profit basis through a core laboratory funded by the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. 'The hope is that this will accelerate research,' said Prof Daley.         'Researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patient's disease into the test tube, to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood, the brain and the heart, for example,' he says.         'Now, we have a way to do just that, which means the cells can make any tissue and can grow forever. This enables us to model thousands of conditions using classical cell culture techniques.'         For years, researchers have grown human cells in the laboratory in an attempt to mimic various genetic diseases, but cells taken directly from affected patients typically have a limited lifespan when grown in laboratory dishes         In this case, the cell lines were created using a new technique that reprograms human adult skin cells into cells that resemble embryonic stem cells. The technique used to make these cells - called induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells - was a major advance in the field that was first reported in 2006 by Prof Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University, Japan (pluripotent refers to how the cells can grow into many different types.)         Over the longer term, Prof Daley expects the technique will be applied in the clinic. For example, it may allow scientists to develop therapies using a patient's own cells - reengineering the cells to correct a disease-causing defect then re-introducing them into the body to repair damage."
telegraph,11/12/2006 0:01,news,"A child's need for a father will no longer be a consideration when a woman seeks fertility treatment, ministers will say this week.          The move – which comes despite widespread public opposition and which will give single women and lesbians the right to treatment – forms part of a shake-up of Britain's embryology laws. One of the key proposals would allow research on test-tube embryos that were part-human, part-animal — referred to as 'chimeras'.          The changes, which ministers say have 'fundamental social, legal and ethical aspects', are set out in a Department of Health 'command paper' seen by The Sunday Telegraph.          Homosexual couples will have the same parental rights as heterosexuals and, for the first time, all parents will be banned from choosing the sex of their baby for non-medical reasons.          However, embryos will be able to be screened for genetic abnormalities 'which may lead to serious medical conditions, disabilities or miscarriage'.          Screening will also be expressly permitted to identify a 'tissue match for a sibling suffering a life-threatening illness', but the document rules out 'family balancing' and adds that most people surveyed in a consultation exercise believed 'this should not be a matter of choice open to parents'.          The creation of combined human-animal embryos under licence will be popular among stem-cell researchers, including a team from the North East England Stem Cell Institute, which has submitted plans to create a human-cow chimera embryo. However, it will be bitterly contested by reproductive ethics campaigners who brand such ideas 'abhorrent'.          The aim of the shake-up is to bring the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act into line with scientific advances and to make sure the law is 'fit for purpose in the early 21st century'. Caroline Flint, the health minister, claims in her foreword: 'The over-arching aim is to pursue the common good through a system broadly acceptable to society.'          She proposes doing away with the current regulatory bodies, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Human Tissue Authority, and replacing them with a Regulatory Authority for Tissue and Embryos (Rate). Some medical advances will be outlawed, including the possible creation of a child by combining genetic material of two women, which would render males redundant altogether.          However, the law obliging clinics to consider a child's 'need for a father' is to be scrapped – despite backing from the public for the present system. However, the need to take account of the 'welfare of the child' before treatment is given will stay.          Robert Whelan, the deputy director of Civitas, the institute for the study of civil society, criticised the plans to give single mothers the right to fertility treatment.          'It is grossly irresponsible to deliberately bring a child into the world in circumstances which will leave it at a disadvantage,' he said.          'The people who engage in this sort of activity see children as an accessory and something they can have as a right. The fact that the child will suffer is secondary.'          In other changes, private companies which provide sperm to women over the internet will be regulated for the first time and charities and other non-profit-making organisations will be able to advertise surrogacy services.          Sperm donors will get 'access [to] limited, non-identifying information about children conceived as a result of their donations'.          They will also, 'in some circumstances', have the right to be informed when their identifying details are provided to their children when they reach 18.          Donor-conceived children can find out if they have siblings conceived by the same method when they reach 18.          Another change will affect storage of embryos. This can currently be done for five years as long as neither parent withdraws consent.          The Government proposes extending this period to 10 years and also to introduce a one-year 'cooling-off period' where an embryo can still be stored if one parent withdraws consent.          The paper, expected on Friday, will set out the Government's plans ahead of a draft Bill next year."

Solicitors Leigh Day & Co is looking into the possibility of seeking   compensation for potentially 'hundreds' of MS and spinal cord   injury patients who paid around £10,000 for the treatments, often raising   the money through charity events. Jill Paterson, a solicitor at the firm, said: 'We support the GMC's   findings today that Dr Trossel is no longer fit to practise in the UK. 'We are actively investigating the pursuit of legal proceedings against   him to right the wrongs caused to these vulnerable people.' Dutch-trained Dr Trossel, 56, who practised in both London and Rotterdam,   admitted he had been “too enthusiastic” about the practice during a   long-running disciplinary hearing in London. The GMC heard that he had no background in neurology or haematology and that   he was not an expert in stem cell research. He was found to have used stem cells that were not designed for human use and   to have injected four patients with material containing bovine brain and   spinal cord live cells without obtaining informed consent. Prof Brian Gomes da Costa, chairman of the GMC fitness to practise panel, told   Dr Trossel he had exploited vulnerable patients, giving them false hope   through “unsubstantiated and exaggerated” claims. He said: “Your conduct has unquestionably done lasting harm, if not   physically, then mentally and financially, to these patients and also to   their families and supporters. 'It is, therefore, undeniable that you have abused the position of trust   afforded to you.”Dr Trossel’s practices were highlighted in a BBC2 Newsnight investigation in   August 2006. He was suspended from the medical register by the GMC in July   the following year. The GMC ruled that there was “scant” prospect of the alleviation of MS   symptoms by stem cell therapy. But it ruled that he was not dishonest   because he believed the claims he had made about stem cell therapy Tom Kark QC, for the GMC, spoke of the patients' 'anger and sense of   being let down'. Karen Galley, 45, from Hadleigh, Essex, who was charged around £10,500 for   seven injections and gave evidence against Dr Trossel, said: 'I think   it is fantastic that they have struck him off. In my eyes, it is not enough,   but we are getting somewhere. He deserves everything he gets.' After the verdict, Dr Trossel said: 'I would like to take the opportunity   to say how sorry I am for any distress caused to my patients during this   time.”"
telegraph,8/2/2010 6:30,news,"A longevity gene has been identified for the first time in a breakthrough that could eventually help people live longer, a new study suggests.The researchers have located a gene which determines whether or not a person   will biologically age quickly or slowly. They think that by testing for the gene when some one is young could identify   whether they have to alter their lifestyle accordingly. In the longer term it may be possible to manipulate the gene so that life   spans can be extended.  'This gives us for the first time a better understanding of biological   ageing, ' said Professor Nilesh Samani at the University of Leicester.  'It is the first step to understanding why people age. Once we have a   full understanding we should be able to manipulate it in a manner to   influence how someone ages.' Cells in the body are constantly replacing themselves before they die. But   each replication is not perfect and the faults that are passed down cause   the body to age. One form of damage is caused to the telomeres – the end parts of chromosomes   which act like the plastic tips of shoelaces and stop them from fraying. The problem is that they shorten each time they replicate and eventually are   so short that replication becomes impossible and the cell dies forever. The scientists have discovered that a variant of the TERC gene determines not   only how long the telomeres are when someone is born but also how quickly   they shorten. Prof Samani, who reported his findings in the Journal Nature Genetics,   discovered the variant by comparing the genetic make-up and biological age   of more than 10,000 people. He said: 'In this study what we found was that those individuals carrying   a particular genetic variant had shorter telomeres i.e. looked biologically   older.  'Given the association of shorter telomeres with age-associated   diseases, the finding raises the question whether individuals carrying the   variant are at greater risk of developing such diseases.' Professor Tim Spector from King's College London, who co-led this project,   said: 'What our study suggests is that some people are genetically   programmed to age at a faster rate.  'The effect was quite considerable in those with the variant, equivalent   to between 3-4 years of 'biological ageing' as measured by telomere   length loss.  'Alternatively genetically susceptible people may age even faster when   exposed to proven 'bad' environments for telomeres like smoking, obesity or   lack of exercise – and end up several years biologically older or succumbing   to more age-related diseases.

But that method, pioneered in Japan, required a virus to genetically alter adult cells, such as skin cells, into embyro-like cells and there were safety concerns.         Now a team at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla and the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Germany, reports in the journal Cell Stem Cell that they have used drugs to help turn brain cells from an adult back into embryo like stem cells.         'We are on the way' toward generating such cells without using genetic modification, said Dr Sheng Ding.         His team's work deals with some of the major drawbacks of the technique developed two years ago by Japanese researcher Shinya Yamanaka and provide a safer, more efficient method to reprogram cells that should speed their use in a wide range of treatments, from degenerative brain disease to heart disease.         'This shows that we can make cell reprogramming technology much more practical than it has been,' says Dr Ding, an associate professor at Scripps Research and a chemist who studies stem cell biology. 'These advances will bring us closer to the day when we can use these powerful cells to make any kind of human tissue that we need to help patients.'         While Yamanaka introduced four genes, at least two linked with cancer, to turn back the clock so they became more embryo like, Dr Ding uses just two genes, along with drugs, reducing the need for viruses and doing away with the cancer gene.         Dr Ding believes that, someday, chemical cocktails might be used instead of viruses to reprogram cells for cell-based therapy. One cocktail of small molecules would be used to revert specialized adult cells back to an earlier developmental stage, and then a second cocktail would differentiate the cell into the type needed to replace diseased cells in any organ or tissue.         'This study is a proof of principle that this kind of approach is possible,' he says."
telegraph,27/06/2000 00:00,news,"A MILESTONE for mankind was passed yesterday with the announcement that scientists have completed a working draft of the 'Book of Life', the entire human genetic code.                               The double-helix structure of DNA of which only a tiny fraction relates to our genes          The draft of the three billion 'letters' that spell the recipe for Homo sapiens was greeted with angst over future ethical challenges. Prime ministers, presidents and professors compared it to landing on the Moon and the invention of the wheel.It had been hoped that the much-heralded simultaneous announcement by publicly and privately funded ventures would end a bitterly fought race. But the American private venture, Celera Genomics, struck an acrimonious note when it suggested that its 'first assembly' was better than the public 'working draft'.Dr Michael Dexter, of Britain's Wellcome Trust, part of the public project, said that rivalry was intense because the genome had the potential to touch the lives of every person, marking the outstanding achievement not only of our lifetime but perhaps of the history of mankind.While the draft opens the possibilities of innovative treatments for disease, it may mark the dawn of a Brave New World, where information could be abused to create a genetic underclass or designer babies.The genome contains 38,000 genes, possibly as many as 115,000, and the most common families consist of genes that control others. But this is only the start of a vast effort to uncover the tiny fraction of DNA that corresponds to genes, how they describe the proteins that build and run the body, what goes wrong to cause disease and how variations affect our predisposition to illness.President Clinton joined Tony Blair in praising the feat at a satellite-linked press conference. He said: 'Today we are learning the language in which God created life. We are gaining ever more awe for the complexity, the beauty, the wonder of God's most divine and sacred gift. It is conceivable that our children's children will know the word 'cancer' only as a constellation of stars.'Mr Blair said that the 'implications far surpassed even the discovery of antibiotics, the first great technological triumph of the 21st century'. He acknowledged that many people, himself included, were uneasy, but said: 'The role of science is to inquire and discover and it is the role of society and government on behalf of society to make judgments on what we then do and how we respond. I don't ever want to see science limited in its inquiry.'Mr Clinton cautioned that genetic knowledge must never be used to segregate, discriminate or invade privacy and offered Britain the opportunity to join America and other countries in a global collaboration to establish an ethical, legal and moral framework for its use.The Wellcome Trust, which has invested £210 million in gene reading, of which £80 million was spent on the human project, said that legislation was needed to address genetic discrimination, although it stressed that the benefits far outweighed the risks.On a personal note, Mr Clinton said that the year of the birth of Mr Blair's son, Leo, would be remembered as the year of the genome, adding: 'His life expectancy has just gone up by about 25 years.' He and Mr Blair congratulated the Celera scientists, who the Prime Minister said had helped accelerate the completion of the draft 'in the spirit of scientific competition'.Celera broke away from the American public effort, spurred by the prospect of lucrative patents. Unlike the public project, which has released its data on the internet, Celera has held its information back to protect its rights.Dr John Sulston, the director of the Sanger Centre, near Cambridge, where one third of the code was tackled with Wellcome's backing, said: 'I for one did not want my genetic information being under the control of any one corporation. We had to fight, sadly. I hope that the fighting is over. It is really important for academe and industry that these data are available and everyone can use them.'He hoped the simultaneous announcement would end the 'ill feeling' so that both he and Celera could mark an achievement by thousands of scientists which will 'profoundly alter the way in which society thinks of itself'.But Celera, of Rockville, Maryland, suggested that it was ahead in the process of reading the code, in which the genome is broken up, sequenced and put back into the right order. Dr Craig Venter, the company's president, congratulated the public effort, but said Celera knew 'for the first time in history the order and orientation of this information.'The fragments in the public draft 'are largely unordered', Celera said, whereas it had placed them 'in the proper order'. Dr Tim Hubbard, of the Sanger Centre, said: 'We can't see their data, so who can say?'Wellcome and the Sanger Centre said they supported a suggestion already made to Unesco that the genome should be declared a world monument to be held in trust, freely available, for all mankind. The draft was 'a vast and unique gift' to celebrate the commonality of mankind, Dr Sulston said."
telegraph,16/05/2011 07:00,news,"A new blood test that could help predict how long someone has to live, based on their speed of ageing, is due to go on sale in Britain later this year. Researchers have developed the £435 test, which they say accurately measures   the length of a person's telomeres, which is thought to be linked to   longevity. Telomeres are sections of DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes, protecting   them from damage and the loss of cell functions associated with ageing. Shorter telomeres are thought to be an indicator of faster ageing. A Spanish firm, Life Length, has developed the new commercial “death test”,   which it says will show people how long they have to live. 'Knowing whether our telomeres are a normal length or not for a given   chronological age will give us an indication of our health status and of our   physiological 'age' even before diseases appear,' said Maria Blasco,   the head of the telomeres research at the Spanish National Cancer Research   Centre, in Madrid. Her private firm, which is talks to manufacture the test throughout Europe,   including Britain, and America, expects strong demand from people wanting to   learn when they potentially will die. Experts say it will also help people develop healthy habits, improve their   diet and reduce their stress. “What is new about this test is that it is very precise,” she added. “We can detect very small differences in telomere length and it is a very   simple and fast technique where many samples can be analysed at the same   time.”She expected the test to go on sale later this year.

The 37-year-old would die if the mechanical pump   controlling his heart stopped working. Every day he is forced to carry a heavy power pack strapped to his hips which   makes many everyday activities, such as bathing and sleeping, difficult. But a new gene therapy is offering hope to the 150 Britons like Mr Adams who   are forced to use heart pumps while waiting for a transplant. If successful it could mean than heart transplants are no longer necessary for   any patient. Imperial College has launched a trial which aims to increase the levels of   protein in heart muscle cells and rebuild the damaged organ. If successful the heart muscle would be able to pump blood around the body   without any help. Mr Adams, of Hertfordshire, is the first person in the world to take part in   the trial. 'It took some getting used to, living with a (heart pump),” he said. “You can't just jump in the bath or the shower and it's difficult sleeping   whilst being attached to it. Everywhere I go I have to carry the power   supply and spare batteries in a backpack. 'Of course the best thing that could happen would be for my heart   function to show signs of improvement and for the gene therapy to prove to   be a 'miracle cure' for myself and other patients. “If it does prove to be successful it would be exciting for patients who need   a transplant but end up on the waiting list for a long time because of the   shortage of donors.'Heart failure occurs when the heart no longer pumps blood effectively and it   affects hundreds of thousands of people in the UK. Some patients with advanced heart failure are fitted with a Left Ventricular   Assist Device (LVAD), a mechanical pump which supports the failing heart and   aims to restore normal blood flow. The pump moves the blood from the left ventricle into the main artery (aorta)   so it can circulate the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. Currently there are around 100 to 150 people in the UK living with a pump. The new therapy is designed to increase levels of SERCA2a protein in heart   muscle cells. SERCA2a plays an important role in heart muscle contraction. Genes are   inserted into the heart muscle cells to increase the level of SERCA2a using   a harmless engineered virus which will spread in the organ and help repair   the damage muscle so it can pump on its own. The team plans to take small biopsy samples of the heart muscle six months   after treatment to measure if the gene is present, detectable and functional   in the patients' hearts. The patients in the trial have been recruited from Harefield Hospital, London   and Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire. Dr Nick Banner, the consultant cardiologist at Harefield Hospital who carried   out the first gene therapy infusion, said: 'Advanced heart failure is a   progressive condition that results in a poor quality of life and shortened   life expectancy. “The best treatment currently available is a heart transplant but the shortage   of donor organs in the UK means that many patients will die on the   transplant waiting list. 'LVADs can keep some patients alive long enough for a donor heart to   become available. “The rationale for this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a new   form of therapy, which might in the future be a viable alternative to   transplantation. “This study will help us better understand whether the concept of repairing a   heart with gene therapy might be possible, even in patients with advanced   heart failure. “The small pilot trial will initially involve 24 patients, including Mr Adams. Of the patients enrolled in the study, 16 will be treated with the gene   therapy and eight will be treated with a placebo. Professor Sian Harding, Professor of Cardiac Pharmacology and Head of the BHF   Centre of Regenerative Medicine in Imperial College London, who helped   develop the treatment, said: 'We will be using state-of-the art methods   to gain detailed information on how and where the gene therapy takes effect,   which will potentially help us develop and improve the therapy. “It's important to remember that the therapy is not correcting a gene defect.   We are working much more downstream, which means that no matter what the   cause of the heart failure, the therapy should be equally beneficial for   patients whether their heart problems stem from genes, lifestyle or the   environment or a mixture of all of these.'"
telegraph,12/9/2012 18:00,news,"A new stem cell treatment to repair ear damage offers the hope of a cure for a common form of deafness which could benefit more than 300,000 Britons, researchers claim. Scientists demonstrated for the first time that stem cells can be used to   replace dead of damaged nerve cells in the ear which are the cause of   deafness in more than 10 per cent of all sufferers. Human stem cells cultured in a test tube were injected into the ears of   gerbils which had been deafened, helping to restore on average 45 per cent   of the rodents' former hearing ability. The technique is not yet safe for human trials but could ultimately form the   basis of a new treatment for auditory neuropathy, where deafness is caused   by nerve damage in the inner ear, researchers said. Some people are born with the condition, while others can develop it for other   reasons such as jaundice at birth or exposure to noise later in life. The   only current treatment is a highly invasive brain stem implant. In the new study, published in the Nature journal, researchers from Sheffield   University took stem cells from human embryos and used chemicals to mould   them into ear cell 'progenitor' cells, which can turn into cell types   used in hearing. Eighteen gerbils were given a drug to make them deaf in one ear, before being   given an injection of 50,000 progenitor cells into the cochlea, which   translates sounds into nerve impulses which can be sent to the brain.On average about a third of the cells grafted themselves to the ear and   replace the damaged nerve cells. Brain scans showed that the gerbils   typically recovered 45 per cent of their hearing after 10 weeks. In humans this would translate to someone who could formerly not hear a lorry   passing by their window gaining the ability to follow a conversation in a   crowded room, researchers said. They added that the results were variable, with some gerbils recovering up to   90 per cent of their hearing and others seeing very little improvement,   depending on how many of the cells took hold. More research is needed to establish that the benefits of the treatment are   lasting and that it is safe for use on humans, but the study represents a 'huge   step forward' in deafness research, the team said. Dr Marcelo Rivolta, who led the study, said: 'Stem cells have been used   in animal models of deafness before, mostly the mouse, with different   results, but none have shown functional recovery. What we have shown here is   functional recovery using human stem cells, which is unique. 'It is difficult to say when we might be able to treat patients. We are   hoping in a few years, but first we need to understand more about the   biology of the system and whether it is sustainable in time and safe.' "

Researchers hope the new technique could allow them to speed the recovery of damaged bones and cartilage.          If successful it could be used to help trauma victims as well as the more than two million Britons who suffer from osteoarthritis.         Caused by deterioration of cartilage, severe osteoarthritis can be treated only with surgery to replace hips and knees with artificial joints.          Reprogrammed stem cells work well in laboratories but struggle in the 'adverse' conditions of the human body.          Scientists at Edinburgh University plan to use a 'bioactive scaffold' to protect the cells when they are placed in a patient.         This new environment, which consists of a rigid mesh structure, coated or impregnated with drugs to aid the cells, allows them to grow at a faster rate, speeding recovery.          The technique will be particularly useful in the treatment of damaged cartilage, which never repairs fully itself, researchers say.         A significant proportion of those who damage their cartilage while young go on to develop arthritis.         Researchers hope to place bone and cartilage building stem cells, complete with their scaffolds, in up to 30 patients within the next two years and to move on to larger trials if these prove successful.         Dr Brendon Noble, of the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Regenerative Medicine, said: 'We hope that this will kick start the body's natural healing processes, enabling cells to grow and carry out repair to the damaged area.'         Dr Noble's team will work with surgeons to ensure the treatments they develop are suitable for practical use and will look to use reprogrammed cells derived from blood as well as bone marrow.         The £31.4 million project has been funded by the UK Stem Cell foundation, the Medical Research Council and Scottish Enterprise.         Dr Anna Krassowska, research manager for the UK Stem Cell Foundation, said: 'In the UK hip fractures kill 14,000 elderly people every year - more than many cancers.          'This research has the potential not only to impact on a significant number of people's lives but to open up one of the largest stem cell markets in the industry.'         More than 30,000 knee replacements and 50,000 hip replacement operations are carried out each year in England and Wales."
telegraph,10/6/2000 0:00,news,"A ROUGH draft of the entire human genetic code has been completed, after years of work by thousands of researchers worldwide. The achievement is a milestone in a project that will change the face of medicine and society.The effort to read the code, or genome, will pave the way for a medical revolution but also create dilemmas over how genetic information should be used. It raises the prospect of 'designer babies', for instance, or tests to assess insurance premiums or select employees.The goal of the Human Genome Project, a publicly funded international consortium, and its commercial rival, Celera Genomics in the US, is to read all three billion 'letters' of the human genetic code, the book of life. Formal announcements of the first working drafts - 90 per cent of the recipe for a human being, or genome - are expected within the next week or so.This autumn, probably October, the journals Nature and Science will publish the first analysis of what the data from the public effort means, such as the number of genes it takes to make a man. Each cell contains the code, in bundles called chromosomes. The letters of the code - As, Cs, Gs and Ts - spell out genes, the instructions to make the proteins in an organism.However, completion of the working drafts mark only the beginning in terms of understanding disease and the effort to develop drugs to prevent and treat illness, or to use gene transplants.Celera said it had 'completed the sequencing phase of the genome from one human being' and was about to announce that the information had been assembled into the rough draft. A spokesman for the genome project, which consists of 16 centres around the world, said it too had completed the draft.A spokesman for the Sanger Centre, near Cambridge, said: 'The sequence is there, or thereabouts. But we still have to go through some checking. ' He said that about 20 per cent of the code has been finished. Reading the entire code will be the most momentous achievement since James Watson and Francis Crick identified the structure of DNA in 1953 at Cambridge.When the effort was first mooted in the Eighties, no one imagined it would be completed as swiftly or as cheaply. However, even when the final draft appears, expected in 2003, gaps will remain due to deficiencies in the method used to interpret and reproduce the code."
telegraph,21/10/2000 00:00,education,"A TEST-TUBE baby has been born after doctors in America say they tissue-matched an embryo so that the child could provide life-saving cells for his sick sister.Stem cells from the umbilical cord of Adam Nash have already been given to his sister, Molly, who suffers from a rare form of anaemia. Without a bone marrow transplant, which contains stem cells, she had only a year to live.Genetic selection is not regulated in America as it is in Britain. Here, licences are given so that embryos can be selected to avoid serious genetic disorders in the babies. But the American case takes that process a step further - screening an embryo for the medical benefit of someone else.The procedure raises a host of ethical questions, including the fate of healthy but unsuitable embryos. A spokesman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said yesterday that they had never had a request for embryo selection in order that tissue from a baby could be used to help a sibling.Some couples with a child who needs a bone marrow transplant are known to have had further children naturally in the hope that there would be a good bone marrow match. There have also been anecdotes of parents having unborn babies tested and aborted if they did not match.The American case may be the first in the world where a baby was genetically selected for the purpose of saving a life. Lisa and Jack Nash, of Colorado, were reluctant to have another baby naturally as there was a 25 per cent chance that, like six-year-old Molly, it would suffer Fanconi anaemia, an inherited disorder that causes a failure in production of bone marrow cells.Doctors at the Reproductive Genetics Institute in Chicago created 12 embryos using eggs and sperm from the couple. Each was tested to make sure that it did not carry Fanconi anaemia, and would have been tested for a tissue match at the same time. Only one embryo was suitable. Adam was born on August 29 and a month later doctors infused cells from the baby's umbilical cord into his sister.Dr Charles Strom, director of medical genetics at the Illinois Masonic Medical Centre, said Molly had a 90 per cent chance of being cured. It would take a week to see if Adam's stem cells had destroyed the Fanconi gene.Mrs Nash, who held her baby as his cells dripped into his sister, said: 'It was the most awesome, monumental experience of our life, yet it was so simple. You'd think there would be thunderbolts and lightning but it was calm.'Defending the decision to genetically test the embryos, she said: 'People who feel that what we have done is inappropriate are allowed to feel that it is inappropriate for them, but please do not say that it is inappropriate for us. Those who complain have, more than likely, not been in our position.'Molly has not had a normal life for a six-year-old. She has never even been to school and now she will be able to go. And she's got a brother. We wanted Molly to have a sibling and we will eventually use one of the other safe embryos to have another child.'The case has raised concerns in America about the ethics of selecting an embryo to help a third party. Jeffrey Kahn, director of the University of Minnesota's bioethics centre, told the Washington Post: 'I suspect it is only because we haven't yet done the tests that we are not having parents asking for embryos without a predisposition to homosexuality or for kids who will grow to more than six feet tall.'In Britain regulation of fertility clinics is among the most advanced in the world. The HFEA licenses five clinics for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. A single cell is taken from an embryo created in vitro and tested for the presence of a disease gene.The HFEA has already ruled that embryos cannot be selected for social, physical or psychological characteristics, and Adam's selection for a tissue match could be interpreted as selection on physical grounds. The HFEA does allow embryo selection to screen out inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anaemia haemophilia and muscular dystrophy.Dr Gill Lockwood, medical director of Midland Fertility Services, and an ethicist, said: 'What we have here is a baby being created so that stem cells can be donated to his sister. Siblings who have been born to donate cells are loved for themselves and can have a special place in the family.'Before people rush to judgments I think we should consider that this is a couple trying to save the life of a loved child, something that every parent would understand. They are entitled to pull out all the stops.'Dr Paul Veys, consultant in stem cell transplants at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital, said creating children to be used as donors for siblings was 'wrong'. He said the case highlighted the 'grey area' where genetic screening could save lives and cure fatal diseases, but also lead to parents eventually being able to choose the eye colour or IQ of their babies."
dailymail,9/3/2015 22:33,health,"A tiny ‘grow-bag’ could be a new way to mend hearts damaged by disease or heart attack. The capsule, which is pea-sized, contains stem cells that trigger the growth of new cells.An estimated 2.3 million people in Britain have coronary heart disease — the country’s leading cause of death.It occurs when the arteries supplying the heart become blocked by fatty substances, reducing the flow of blood.If a bit of this fatty substance breaks off, it can trigger a blood clot, which in turn cuts off the blood supply to heart muscle, causing it to die off. This is what triggers a heart attack.Heart disease and heart attacks can also lead to heart failure, where the heart becomes too weak to pump blood around the body properly.The new treatment is designed to treat damaged heart muscle. The capsule contains stem cells derived from the patient’s bone marrow — stem cells are the body’s ‘master cells’, capable of turning into any other type.The idea is that once in place, the stem cells release proteins and growth factors, stimulating new heart muscle cells in the damaged area. In a minimally invasive procedure, the capsule can either be attached by stitches to the heart wall, or injected into the tissue with the help of a catheter — a tube — under general anaesthetic.The capsule is made from electrospun fibres — made from a synthetic polymer — which prevent the stem cells inside from migrating to other areas where they are not wanted.Laboratory research suggests that after just two to four weeks the heart’s function is improved.‘Our research has given every indication that these devices could be revolutionary in repairing heart damage and treating heart failure,’ says Dr Glenn Gaudette, professor of biomedical engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in the U.S., who has been working with the developer, BioSurfaces, for six years. The technology has been patented and is now being commercialised.Mohamed Amrani, consultant cardiac and transplant surgeon and honorary senior lecturer at the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust, said: ‘Given the potential consequences it could yield, it is, in my opinion, the most original approach to heart diseases for decades. The preliminary results of stem cell research are very encouraging.’Meanwhile, researchers from Italy are testing the benefits of a protein in wholegrains in lowering the risk of heart disease.In a study at Federico II University, Naples, overweight men and women at risk of heart disease will be given supplements containing aleurone, the protective layer that surrounds the seed in grains.The volunteers will take them for eight weeks and the results will be compared with a control group.Aleurone is rich in proteins and antioxidants, and has been shown to reduce inflammation and lower cholesterol. "
telegraph,30/11/2004 00:01,education,"A woman who has been paralysed for almost 20 years has started to walk again after scientists injected stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood into her spine.           The researchers claim the work - which they admit has yet to be replicated - may mark the first case in which a patient with spinal cord injuries has been successfully treated in this way.          Hwang Mi-Soon, 37, had been bedridden since an accident in 1985 damaged her lower back and hips. Afterwards, she was confined to her bed or a wheelchair.          The scientists isolated stem cells from umbilical cord blood and injected them into the spinal cord on Oct 12 this year.          Two weeks after the operation, she could move her hips. After 25 days, her feet responded to stimulation and she started to walk with the help of a walking frame. 'This is already a miracle for me,' she said. 'I never dreamed of getting to my feet again.'          The team was led by Prof Song Chang-hun of Chosun university, Prof Kang Kyung-sun of Seoul National University and Dr Han Hoon from the Seoul Cord Blood Bank (SCB). 'We have glimpsed a silver lining over the horizon,' said Prof Chang-hun. 'We were all surprised at the fast improvements in the patient.'          So-called 'multipotent' stem cells - those found in cord blood - are capable of forming a limited number of specialised cell types, unlike the more versatile 'undifferentiated' cells that are derived from embryos. But the team believes stem cells from umbilical cord offer an ethical alternative to embryos.          The finding was greeted with caution by Dr Robin Lovell-Badge of the National Institute of Medical Research, Mill Hill, who warned that it could be a coincidental recovery. 'It could be that her problem was one of inflammation around the nerves rather than direct damage to the nerves and the procedure 'merely' (although very helpfully) reduced the inflammation.'          • Scientists have found a way to treat incontinent women by taking muscle-building stem cells from the arm.          The stem cells - parents of other types - improved muscle strength in the urethra in the first clinical study of its kind on 20 women, the results of which were presented yesterday to the Radiological Society of North America. One year later, 18 of the patients remain continent."
telegraph,16/10/2013 07:01,technology,"Activities that involve gathering vast quantities of data are often portrayed in a negative light, but Sophie Curtis reveals how 'big data' is also being used to identify the links between genetics and diseases such as cancer, diabetes and obesity. From Google to Facebook and GCHQ to the NSA, every day we hear more about the   lengths to which organisations are going to get their hands on our precious   data. Companies want access to data so they can make assumptions and predictions   about their customers' behaviour and, in some cases, use this information to   deliver targeted advertising. The argument is that the more you know about   your customers, the better you can serve them, and the more money you can   make. Government security agencies want access to data so they can gather   information about suspicious groups, monitor communications, detect   anomalous patterns of behaviour and ultimately catch criminals and prevent   terrorist attacks. Retail, advertising, manufacturing, transport, energy, local government,   charity – whichever sector you care to look at, data is playing an   increasingly important role in our society and economy. While many people   view this as an invasion of their privacy, the majority of this data is   anonymous and contributes to genuinely valuable research. The Human Genome Project, for example, whose goal was the complete mapping and   understanding of all the genes of human beings, required the processing of   vast amounts of data, in order to determine the sequence of chemical base   pairs which make up human DNA. Although the Human Genome Project was declared complete in April 2003,   data-driven medical research is a growing field. The Wellcome Sanger   Institute, which was the single largest contributor to the Human Genome   Project, is now using so-called 'big data' to investigate the genetic   make-up of some of the most common causes of premature death. As one of the top five scientific institutions in the world specialising in   DNA sequencing, Sanger Institute embraces the latest technologies to   research the genetic basis of global health problems, including cancer,   malaria, diabetes, obesity and infectious diseases. The hope is to one day   understand the link between disease and genetics. The sequencing machines that run today produce a million times more data than   the machine used in the Human Genome Project, and the Sanger Institute   produces more sequences in one hour than it did in its first 10 years. For instance, a single cancer genome project sequences data that requires up   to 10,000 computer processing hours for analysis, and the Sanger Institute   is doing tens of thousands of these at once. The sheer scale is enormous and   the computational effort required is huge. The Sanger Institute has five or six major projects on the go at any one time,   using data from a wide variety of sources. For example, one project called   UK10K involves sequencing 10,000 individuals from across the UK to compare   their genomes. 'Of course it’s properly consented data and it’s then done anonymously.   We don’t actually know who they are, we just get the samples and then we   look at them,' said Tim Cutts, acting head of scientific computing at   the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. The data is analysed using the Sanger Institute's supercomputer, which has   17,000 Intel processors and 22 petabytes of storage from DDN and other   vendors. This data is then shared within the research community and through   the Sanger Institute’s website, which gets 20 million hits and 12 million   impressions each week. 'We have to have the ability to access this data very quickly, and your   average disk drive from PC World just isn’t going to cut it,'   said Cutts. 'When you’re doing storage at this scale, we have to make   sure that it is reliable and happens quickly enough.'He gave the example of Addenbrooke's teaching hospital in Cambridge, which   recently had a few cases of MRSA in its neo-natal ward. Samples of the   bacteria were sent to the Sanger Institute, which sequenced them in real   time and identified that they were the same strain as each other, and that   therefore there was a single source of the infection Addenbrooke's was then able to go through its records and identify where the   bacteria had come from, meaning that the problem could be cleaned up and   sorted out much faster than the hospital would have otherwise been able to   do. Cutts also pointed to the Sanger Institute's discovery of a variant in a gene   called BRAF, which was identified as being authored in 60 per cent of cases   of malignant melanoma. This has led to the development of a treatment in   just nine years, proving that rapid innovation is achievable with this kind   of technology. 'The sort of statistical correlation analysis that we’re doing these days   is an absolute classic 'big data' problem,' said Cutts. 'It’s   exactly the sort of thing that market research people will be doing with   your Nectar Point data – it’s the same sort of calculation but it’s a   different problem.' "
telegraph,20/03/2005 00:01,news,"Aid agencies and environmentalists have deceived the public over genetically modified crops by deliberately ignoring scientific evidence that supports the technology, according to a new book.          The March of Unreason, by Dick Taverne, the Liberal Democrat peer, accuses Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and other green groups of turning their opposition to GM plants into a 'religious crusade', based on 'blind faith and deep bias' rather than serious research.                                        Lord Taverne, a member of the House of Lords science and technology committee, accuses environmentalists and aid agencies of ignoring 'solid science', citing each others' reports, and using discredited studies to push the case against GM crops.          He also argues that the green lobby has whipped up public hysteria with scare stories and emotive terms such as Frankenstein foods when the science shows overwhelmingly that GM crops will help to ease world hunger and poverty, help the environment and improve public health.          The peer, who is also the founder-chairman of the charity Sense about Science, said that the green lobby's activities had done enormous damage to Britain's biotechnology industry, a field in which it was a world leader.           As a result of the opposition, the Government imposed a five-year moratorium on GM crops - from 1999 until last year - and has still to approve their full-scale commercial production.          In the book, which has been published ahead of tomorrow's announcement by the Government of the results of its latest field-scale evaluation of GM crops, Lord Taverne gives many examples of the green lobby's 'misuse' of evidence and research.          He highlights how a report by the charity Action Aid in 2003 quoted studies by Greenpeace, other green pressure groups and its own 'branches' before concluding that GM crops would not benefit the Third World.          Lord Taverne said, however, that the study ignored the findings of independent experts, the National Academy of Sciences USA, several other national academies of science, the Third World Academy of Sciences, four Royal Society reports and two reports by the Nuffield Council. 'But because it is published by an aid agency and relies on reports by green lobbies to which most newspapers are sympathetic, the press treats it with deference,' he said.          The book also refers to the case of the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), a species said by one study to be at risk from GM crops. Its cause was adopted by green groups and received widespread media attention.          Soon afterwards, however, eminent plant biologists rejected the research when field studies found that the impact on the butterfly was negligible. Despite this, green groups still say that GM crops kill the Monarch.          Another report, Feeding or Fooling the World - Can GM crops really feed the hungry? - published in 2002 by the Genetic Engineering Alliance, a coalition of 120 British-based organisations calling for a ban on GM crops, applies 'a similar lack of rigour', according to Lord Taverne.           'Every possible quotation that supports or might appear to support the case for a freeze is cited, irrespective of its academic worth; no evidence against is mentioned, however eminent and independent the source... in places this report seems almost deliberately designed to mislead,' the author said.          Lord Taverne mentions another report by Action Aid, this time on the Golden Rice project. This involved genetically modifying rice to produce Vitamin A in the body - a breakthrough hailed by scientists as an important step towards helping 14 million children under five years old who suffer from Vitamin A deficiency, which can lead to measles and blindness.          The charity's report dismissed the project as worthless and cited a 'finding' by Greenpeace that a child would have to eat about 7kg of cooked Golden Rice to obtain the required amount of Vitamin A.          The report failed, however, to quote the conclusions of the project's original researchers, who said that a child would benefit by consuming 200g of rice a day.          Lord Taverne said that to dismiss the project on the basis of Greenpeace's claims was 'like quoting the Pope as an unbiased authority on contraception'.           Most of the media have swallowed the green lobby's line, he said. A genetically modified tomato puree was popular until the press began a campaign against Frankenstein foods in 1999, prompted by publicity given to a study in The Lancet.          The research highlighted the adverse effect of GM potatoes on rats, but was discredited as 'flawed' by the Royal Society.           It said that no conclusions should be drawn from it, but Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and their allies, continued to stress health hazards from GM crops, Lord Taverne said.          To illustrate the green lobby's 'eco-fundamentalism' Lord Taverne cites the response of Lord Melchett, then the director of Greenpeace, to a question asked by the Lords select committee on GM crops, which reported in 1999.          Asked about his opposition to GM plants Lord Melchett replied: 'It is a permanent and definite and complete opposition based on a view that there will always be major uncertainties. It is the nature of the technology, indeed it is the nature of science that there will not be any absolute proof.'          The European Commission encourages GM crops, which it has declared to be safe, but EU member states, except Spain, are reluctant to license them.          Lord Taverne's book says, however, that GM technology will lead to more efficient land use and produce more nutritional, varied and cheaper food. The crops will be able to grow in arid and saline areas, survive drought, eliminate the need for pesticides and free land for wildlife.          He highlights the widespread use and success of GM crops in countries including the US, China, South Africa, India and Argentina and expresses puzzlement that the public accepts biotechnology for medicines such as insulin, but not plants.          Green groups rejected the peer's accusations. Tony Juniper, the executive director of Friends of the Earth, said that the green lobby took science 'very seriously' and studies so far had failed to prove the long-term safety of GM crops.          'Science has its limits. We have concerns about the social, economic, environmental and ethical impact of this technology,' he said.          Action Aid also denied that it had ignored scientific evidence, while Pete Riley, the spokesman for the Five-Year Freeze Campaign, another anti-GM lobby group, said.          'Dick Taverne and his friends should get out and find real solutions to the world's problems, and not just help those who want to profit from new technology.'

telegraph,26/11/2001 00:01,education,"AMERICAN scientists claimed yesterday to have cloned the first human embryo, spreading deep alarm among pro-life groups.If the experiments carried out by Advanced Cell Technology, one of America's leading biotechnology companies, are confirmed, it marks a major development in genetic research.The company says it has no plans to use cloned embryos to create babies. Instead it wants to exploit the unspecialised stem cells found in newly conceived embryos for a host of new medical treatments.British cloning experts last night stressed that the company had yet to prove it had created a clone. But pro-life campaigners described the experiments as horrific. Earlier this year the Government approved a change in the law to allow research in Britain into cloned human embryos for medical research.Dr Robert Lanza, vice president of medical and scientific development at ACT, based in Worcester, Massachusetts, said: 'Our intention is not to create cloned human beings.'Rather it is to make lifesaving therapies for a wide range of human disease conditions, including diabetes, strokes, cancer, Aids and neuro-degenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.'The ACT team said it created the embryo using the same technique that was used for Dolly the sheep.It first scraped out the DNA from a human egg cell, then injected it with the nucleus from a human skin cell and finally kick-started the egg with electricity.The experiments were intended to exploit the potential of embryonic stem cells - the body's 'master cells', which can go on to turn into any type of tissue such as muscle, blood, skin or brain. Michael West, chief executive officer of ACT, said: 'The entities we are creating are not individuals. They're only cellular life; they're not human life.'President Bush ruled earlier this year that federal funds could be used for research on embryonic stem cells created before August. Federal money cannot be used to fund human cloning research and the White House reiterated last night that Mr Bush remained '100 per cent' against such work.Ian Wilmut, of the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, who cloned Dolly the sheep, urged caution over the announcement. Because unfertilised eggs could divide spontaneously, the 'embryos' might not have been clones, he said.The embryos were also slow to develop, he said. 'This should be regarded as a preliminary finding.'The Vatican expressed caution and reservation, saying that further scientific verification was necessary. If a real embryo was created, then destroyed, 'that must be condemned', said a spokesman.On the other hand, if ACT had come up with stem cells from other, non-embryonic stem cells, 'then we are talking about a veritable scientific achievement that we could see as ethically positive'.Bruno Quintavelle, director of the Pro Life Alliance, said the American research should raise concern in Britain. He said: 'We're horrified by the news. We have to act soon or someone will exploit the situation in this country. Scientists cannot be trusted to act responsibly.'Legistlation intended to prevent doctors from implanting cloned human embryos in humans is expected to go before MPs within days. But, Mr Quintavelle said, the Bill did not stop anyone from creating those cloned cells in the first place.He said: 'This country is being targeted by the cloning industry. They are going to flock here.'"
telegraph,20/08/2000 00:00,comment,"AMID the furore surrounding last week's announcement that human cloning is to be legalised, I have read all shades of opinion on the issue although ironically the most prophetic words come not from a scientist or academic, but from a long-dead author. In his great Screwtape Letters, C S Lewis noted: 'The softest road to hell is the gradual one, the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without signposts.'I was reminded of those words as various apologists for cloning attempted to reassure a sceptical public that what was being proposed was far from the Frankenstein world of their nightmares. Indeed, it was claimed that the Department of Health's recommendations were really a very minor amendment to existing legislation.The Prime Minister has now set aside time for a free vote on them, but let us be clear: authorisation of human cloning, by Britain alone, is no small step - although one would never believe it reading the triumphalist prose in the British press. The Government has now backed a plan to allow the cloning of human beings.Not balls of cells, but unborn children, who are to be created and nurtured so as to provide stem cells for experiments in the course of which they will be killed. Public concern has been dismissed as merely an outbreak of irrational squeamishness. But instinctive moral repugnance is no more than the natural response to a crass violation of nature's laws.It is the Christian understanding that written onto the heart of every man and woman is an instinctive knowledge of good and evil, of right and wrong. This knowledge is not perfect, and requires study and reflection if it is to develop. Yet there remains buried in the deepest recesses of the human spirit a sense of when a procedure pushes the barriers of science too far. Thus the public's misgivings.The decision of the committee headed by Professor Liam Donaldson, the Chief Medical Officer, to recommend that human cloning should be allowed for research purposes is, as one commentator put it, as lamentable as it was predictable. Despite some of the claims of its supporters, therapeutic cloning will not speedily produce new treatments for disease.It is a science at a very early stage of development and offers no guarantee of success. Of course the long-term aim of such cloning is to provide stem cells to be programmed to grow transplant material for the treatment of the sick. As such, the motivation may be good, but the removal of these cells kills the human beings from whom they are taken. 'Therapeutic cloning' is the ultimate misnomer, for it actually means killing.In moral terms it is never permissible to perform an evil act so that good may come of it. This end, in short, does not justify these means. But the case against human cloning is not limited to morality. Cloning humans is not only wrong, it is unnecessary. On the day that the Government announced its backing for therapeutic cloning, researchers in Florida said that adult stem cells found in bone marrow can be converted into immature nerve cells.So these could be used to treat brain disorders such as strokes or Parkinson's disease - embryos are not needed. This news comes just a fortnight after reports that British scientists had learned of similar potential advantages from adult stem cells in treating patients needing liver transplants. The research suggested the possibility that cells from a patient's own bone marrow could be used to generate new liver tissue, thus avoiding the problem of rejection.These discoveries add weight to arguments that there are ethical alternatives to research cloning. Indeed the Government's report acknowledged it would be possible to 'reprogramme adult cells to make them behave like stem cells with the full potential of embryonic stem cells but without the morally more contestable need to create an embryo'.We are being duped into believing that we can conquer diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes and childhood leukaemia, and repair hearts, livers, kidneys, and so on only by cloning, cannibalising and killing human embryos. The use of language and imagery is revealing. Throughout the Donaldson report cloning is referred to as 'cell nuclear replacement'. The unborn child is referred to as 'the embryo'.Several advocates of cloning reminded us that the embryos involved are no larger than a full stop. But all of us were once no larger than a full stop. When scientists resort to euphemism then it is clear that they fear public reaction. The advocates of cloning are operating in a moral fog. The essential signposts of life, the laws of nature and morality, are being so obscured that there has been created an almost palpable sense of ethical confusion.The current debate is more than medical. It is philosophical, religious and moral. The philosopher's proclamation of the 'death of God', in the vain hope of the emergence of a 'superman', is producing an unmistakable result: the death of man. It cannot be forgotten that the denial of humanity's creaturely status, far from exalting human freedom, in fact creates new forms of slavery and profound suffering. Cloning is a tragic parody of God's omnipotence.Human beings, to whom God has entrusted the created world, giving them freedom and intelligence, are setting the limits to their action not at the threshold of what is right, but rather at the limit of what is possible. The difference must again be highlighted between the conception of life as a gift of love and the view of human beings as a mere chemical by-product.Some years ago, the Catholic Church published a series of 'Reflections on human cloning'. They make interesting reading today: 'Halting the human cloning project is a moral duty which must also be translated into cultural, social and legislative terms. The progress of scientific research is not the same as the rise of scientific despotism.In human cloning the necessary condition for any society begins to collapse: that of treating man always and everywhere as an end, as a value, and never as a mere means or simple object.' Human cloning represents a violation of the fundamental principle on which all human rights are based: equality among human beings.

telegraph,4/3/2011 6:00,news,"Brain cells that are most vulnerable to attack from Alzheimer's Disease have been grown by scientists for the first time in a breakthrough that could help reverse memory loss. Researchers have turned stem cells derived originally from skin into   sophisticated types of neurons in the brain that are critical to memory   retrieval and are killed by the degenerative condition. The development could lead to the discovery of new drug treatments and even   transplantation to repair brain damage. In early Alzheimer's, the ability to retrieve memories is lost, not the   memories themselves and the reason is that cells, called basal forebrain   cholinergic neurons, are killed. There is a relatively small population of these neurons in the brain, and   their loss has a swift and devastating effect on the ability to remember. The idea is that by reproducing a limitless supply of these cells scientists   can work out a way to protect them from dying in the first place and   eventually lead to transplantation into people with Alzheimer's. 'Now that we have learned how to make these cells, we can study them in a   tissue culture dish and figure out what we can do to prevent them from dying,'   said Dr Jack Kessler, who led the study at Northwestern University in   Chicago. Stem cells are 'master cells' which can become any other cell in the   body. Most researchers take them from embryos where they are abundant but   increasingly scientists are able to 'turn back the clock' of   mature cells. In this research the scientists produced the neurons from both kinds of cells. Dr Kessler and his co-author Christopher Bissonnette spent six years before   they eventually came up with the genetic key to produce the new cells. The team demonstrated the newly produced neurons work just like the originals. They transplanted the new neurons into the hippocampus of mice and showed the   neurons functioned normally. 'My goal was to make human stem cells become new healthy replacement   cells so that they could one day be transplanted into a patient's brain,   helping their memory function again,' said Mr Bissonnette, whose   grandfather died from the disease. The ability to make the cells also means researchers can quickly test   thousands of different drugs to see which ones may keep the cells alive when   they are in a challenging environment. This rapid testing technique is called high-throughput screening. The paper wis published in the journal Stem Cells. Professor Clive Ballard, director of research at Alzheimer’s Society, said: 'This   study is a major step forward in developing treatments for Alzheimer’s. 'For the first time researchers have worked out how to transform stem cells   into a specific type of nerve cell that is key in the development of the   disease.'These findings could help us develop new drugs that could benefit people with   Alzheimer’s. We now need further research to find out whether these stem   cells actually work in the brain.' "
telegraph,3/2/2009 18:24,news,"Breakthrough stem cell treatments for conditions such as cancer and diabetes are a step closer after British scientists discovered a way of stabilising and storing them for longer periods in the laboratory. The 'parent cells' have the ability to develop into many other cell types in the body, and scientists believe they have huge potential to treat diseases or injuries that do not currently have a cure.But they are also inherently unstable and begin to mutate into other cells as soon as they are created making it difficult to store them for more than a day or two.Now scientists at the Universities of Bath and Leeds have discovered a chemical that can be added to embryonic stem cells grown in the laboratory, allowing them to multiply without changing into other cell types.Professor Melanie Welham's team at the University of Bath's Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, collaborating with Professor Adam Nelson at the University of Leeds said breakthrough will help scientists produce large stocks of cells that are needed for developing new medical therapies.Professor Welham, who is co-director of the University of Bath's Centre for Regenerative Medicine, added: 'Stem cells have great potential for treating spinal injuries and diseases like type I diabetes because they can change into a range of specialised cell types including nerve or pancreatic cells, which could be used to repair damaged tissues.'Unfortunately, when you grow stem cells in the lab, they can spontaneously develop into specialised cells, making it difficult to grow large enough stocks to use for medical research.'We've identified a chemical that will put this process on hold for several weeks so that we can grow large numbers of them in their unspecialised state. 'This is reversible, so when you take it away from the cells, they still have the ability to change into specialised cells.'Professor Adam Nelson's team, at the Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, made more than 50 chemical compounds that were tested for activity in the stem cells.'The researchers found that the chemicals worked by blocking an enzyme, called GSK3, that can control when the stem cell switches to a more specialised cell type.

The experiments were of 'Frankenstein proportions'.         'I am astonished,' says Prof Sir Martin Evans, stem cell pioneer and Director of the School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, who believes that research, such as this week's news of the creation of cow-human hybrid embryos in Newcastle, is crucial for efforts to work out the science of how embryos work, which will lay the foundation for many future treatments.          But in reference to 'the fuss' there has been 'a lot of misinformation flying around,' says Sir Martin, who will chair a session next week at the first national stem cell conference in Edinburgh,          Although most of his opprobrium is directed at the Church, he believes some scientists have hyped the benefits of creating the hybrids, technically called cybrids, which are more concerned with fundamental understanding than treatments, one point on which he and the cardinal agree.          Sir Martin tells the Telegraph: 'What we are talking about are artificial constructs created and used in the lab, and never going further than the lab, certainly not at the moment. While in embryo form, it is entirely illegal to put one in a human uterus, or an animal one.'          Moreover, there are technical reasons why the embryos are unlikely to develop for more than a few days. 'The embryo has no reproductive future. All the ideas about monsters are hype.'          'To be honest, I think the whole thing is a non event. There have been human animal cell hybrids made for many years,' he says 'Cellular hybrids have a long history and noone has ever looked at these issues before - raising new issues of human dignity and things of this sort shows ignorance, quite honestly.'          He adds that, before the recent debate, he would not even thought about seeking permission to create these embryos - which he now acknowledges is necessary - because he would not have regarded them as human.          And he points out that it would be strange to permit research on early human embryos and not hybrids. 'Why should these constructs of animal and human, grown in the lab for a short time, have a proposed greater protection in the law than a normal human embryo?'          In the wake of his Nobel prize, awarded to him last year for his pioneering stem cell work on mice in Cambridge University, he has often lectured on how scientists are too quick to connect basic research with cures: 'The public is misled about science. It is misled by the enormous practical spin, particularly with medical and the biological sciences.'          A gene discovery may lead to a cure but, in reality, it provides basic understanding and knowledge, a foundation on which to build future treatments. 'That is what is really happening. We are getting an enormous increase in understanding and knowledge.'          In the same way, hybrid embryos are 'good tool for basic science to understand processes that we believe will have practical applications.'          'We do need these constructs because the knowledge we will obtain will pave the way for cells for therapeutic medicine, even if this does not turn out to be the final method used. Hopefully this will be a huge development but what we are really doing is finding out what is going on.         'Unless we understand stem cells, horrible mistakes might be made when we go into the clinic.'          There are also issues concerning chimaeras, blends of human and animal embryo cells (cybrids are genetically mixed at the cellular level). Human cells should be tested in animals, which is 'proper to study their potential to treat serious diseases such as Parkinson's.' But he believes that caution is necessary when, for example, growing human brain tissue in mice.          In America, there was a furore three years when researchers at Stanford University, California, had bred mice with brains that are one per cent human cells and proposed to create what the media called a 'Stuart Little mouse' with all human brain cells.          In such cases, says Sir Martin, there 'are boundaries you would want to regulate carefully.'"
telegraph,13/01/2009 01:41,news,"Britain's research into the creation of human-animal clones has ground to a halt due to a lack of funding. Less than a year after the controversial technique was legalised, funding bodies are refusing to finance the research of hybrid clones.It is feared that existing projects may end completely within weeks, threatening Britain's leading position in the world in creating stem cells from animal-human embryos.The practice, which involves fusing human cells with animal eggs, could one day allow experts to create embryonic stem cells from a patient's skin. This would allow scientists to develop individual treatments for conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and Parkinson's.Two out of three licence holders legally permitted to create hybrid embryos – Professor Stephen Minger of King's College London and Lyle Armstrong of Newcastle University's Centre for Life – have been denied research funds, it was disclosed last night.When the practice was debated in parliament last year, some of Britain's  leading scientists and funding bodies warned it would be disastrous if the research was banned.Those licensed to undertake the research have not been told why their funding has been stopped other than competition from other projects.Prof Minger said his work has not started a year after his licence was issued by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. He told the Independent: 'People reviewing grants may be looking at this from a completely different moral perspective and how much that has influenced people's perception about whether this should be funded, we don't know.'The problem has been a lack of funding. We haven't been able to buy equipment, £80,000 to £90,000-worth.'We put in a grant proposal last year but it wasn't successful and we're dead in the water. We're discussing whether it is worth the time to re-submit our application.' Dr Armstrong has so far created 278 hybrid embryos from human cells and cow eggs but has been denied funding that could help him retrieve embryonic stem cells.He said: 'It seems a lot of effort for nothing. We are investigating other avenues to keep this work going but it is depressing that Britain seems happy to create a nice regulatory environment for this work but then not to provide money for it.'The third licence holder, Professor Justin St John of Warwick University, said his proposal for human-animal hybrid clones has still to begin as he is preparing a grant proposal. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, which allowed the creation of animal-human embryos for stem cell research, was passed in parliament last May and was backed by both Gordon Brown and David Cameron.

The embryos will be destroyed before they are 14-days old and will not be allowed to develop beyond a cluster of cells bigger than a pinhead.         Do you think this is the thin end of the wedge? Or is this work essential for developing new medical techniques and cures?         We have published a selection of your comments below.         This is an immoral decision. It can never be right, for any reason, to use and then extinguish the early life of another human being. Under the weasle words of therapeutic cloning, the HFEA seeks to defend the indefensible. While the objective it seeks to defend, that of finding cures for terrible illnesses which blight human lives, is a noble one, the cloning process is anything but therapeutic to the embryos experimented on as they are subsequently destroyed. Philip Groves, Poplar, London                  The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority's (HFEA) decision to allow human cloning is wrong on every count: it is unethical, unscientific and undemocratic. We know that adult stem cells provide an ethical alternative and are already being used to treat patients using their own cells, which does not involve cloning or destroying embryos. We know that Parliament intended to ban cloning in 1990 when they passed the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. The HFEA seems to have a track record of saying yes to everything, which in my opinion makes them  unsuited to make decisions on such controversial issues. How long until we stop watching the HFEA make one appalling decision after another and let Parliament examine the facts for themselves?Fiona Pinto, Herts UK                   Fetal stem cell research has proven to be a failure:all of the cures have been by  adult stem cells.

It allows humanity to believe that it can pick and choose by itself solely what is good for it.  If human history has proven nothing else, it has proven that humanity does not have the communal good at heart.  Individuals, and the communities created by them, serve only themselves.  A rather well known prophet, priest, and king once said 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and strength, and your neighbour as yourself.'  Nowhere in cloning is their love of anything but self. Kevin L Johnson, Kentucky, USA                  This is not necessary.

A team at Bristol University has been given the go ahead to inject stem cells into the hearts of patients during bypass operations.         Raimondo Ascione, the surgeon leading the research, received approval to carry out the trial from the Human Tissue Authority earlier this week.         While previous smaller studies have provided hope that this approach could provide a breakthrough, this will be the first large-scale trial comparing patients given the treatment with those given placebo injections.         Heart attacks take place when the heart muscle is starved of oxygen, usually because the arteries supplying it with blood become blocked with fatty deposits.         Bypass operations restore the blood supply but can leave behind dead scarred tissue that no longer contributes to the pumping blood around the body.         The new study will test the effectiveness of stem cell injections in repairing these scars in patients who have had acute large heart attacks - in which the scarring penetrates more than halfway through the thickness of the heart wall.         Mr Ascione said yesterday: 'We expect that after six months we will have been able to reduce or even make the scars disappear completely.         'This is the first doubled-blinded, randomised control trial (RCT) trial of its kind to be carried out worldwide.         'If we can prove the principle that this mechanism works in patients with acute heart attacks, it is likely we could also do the same with the many thousands more who have small or medium heart attacks.         'This would have major implications for their quality of life and on reducing the costs of treatments for hospitals.'         The team, who are funded by the British Heart Foundation, will extract a type of bone marrow stem cell called CD133+ from 60 patients undergoing heart bypass operations following acute heart attacks.         Laboratory trials have suggested these cells can grow into heart muscle cells.         Half of the patients will receive injections of the cells during their operation, while the other half will be given placebos.         Six months after the procedure, the study participants will undergo cardiac MRI scans to see whether the stem cells have encouraged significant healing of the heart muscle.         Heart disease is the UK's biggest killer. Approximately one in three of the 230,000 people who suffer a heart attack each year die.         Another team led by Prof John Martin at University College London will next moth start a trial involving injecting a broader group of bone marrow cells into the arteries taking blood to the hearts of 100 patients.         Prof Martin said: 'This is a new phase in stem cell research where we need blinded RCTs to see whether stem cells do work in the real clinical situation.'"

A component of broccoli called sulforaphane targets and kills cancer stem   cells as well as preventing new tumours from growing, according to   researchers at the University of Michigan. Current chemotherapies do not work against cancer stem cells. Researchers   believe that eliminating the cancer stem cells is key to controlling cancer. The study, published in the journal Clinical Cancer Research, charts how   scientists at the university's Comprehensive Cancer Centre tested the   effects of sulforaphane in experiments involving mice and cell cultures. Prof Duxin Sun, the author of the study, said: 'Sulforaphane has been studied   previously for its effects on cancer, but this study shows that its benefit   is in inhibiting the breast cancer stem cells. 'This new insight suggests the potential of sulforaphane or broccoli extract   to prevent or treat cancer by targeting the critical cancer stem cells.' Researchers took mice with breast cancer and injected varying concentrations   of sulforaphane from the broccoli extract. They then used several established methods to assess the number of cancer stem   cells in the tumours. These measures showed a marked decrease in the cancer stem cell population   after treatment with sulforaphane, with little effect on the normal cells. Cancer cells from mice treated with sulforaphane were also unable to generate   new tumours. The researchers then tested sulforaphane on human breast cancer cell cultures   in the lab, finding similar decreases in the cancer stem cells. Researchers are currently developing a method to extract and preserve   sulforaphane. The tests involved higher concentrations of sulforaphane than are available by   simply eating broccoli."

They include BioMarinPharmaceutical Inc in San Rafael, California, andSangamo BioSciences Inc in Richmond, California.If these new hemophilia drugs and others like them succeed, a one-time infusion could replace the need for frequent,life-long injections of blood clotting proteins that can cost upto $300,000 a year for a single patient. These existingtreatments, including Pfizer Inc's Xyntha and BaxterInternational's Advate, are expected to command annualsales of more than $11 billion by 2016.Drugmakers contend that a one-time cure, even at a price ofmore than $1 million, would save money over the long term. Butthere are concerns that health insurers will balk at coveringthat kind of upfront cost.'The place that we are moving toward is more of apay-for-performance type of strategy,' said Edward Lanphier,Sangamo's chief executive officer. Under this model, the pricewould be amortized over a period of time and contingent on proofthat the treatment is effective and safe.The annuity-like payments would be stopped if medicaltesting, such as the level of clotting protein measured in apatient's blood sample, showed that the therapy was not working.Many barriers remain to implementing such a model, and thedrugs for which it is being considered may not reach the marketfor several more years, if at all. Since Americans often switchhealth insurers, contracts - or even legislation - would beneeded to require payers to pick up the ongoing tab for patientswho change their coverage.But the interest in new payment models reflects thehealthcare industry's intention to find new ways to bolsterprofits as insurers push back against drug prices. Some backersof the new model say the payment streams could eventually bepackaged and sold to investors, as happens now with securitiesbacked by financial assets like credit card receivables.'Our approach to this important funding-benefit question isto establish a financing vehicle where the relatively largeupfront cost is amortized in conjunction with the benefit ofthese innovative, curative or preventative therapies,' saidMichael Meyers, managing director and head of investment bankingat T.R. Winston & Company, which is discussing such fundingmodels with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.Dr. Troyen Brennan, chief medical officer at CVS Health Corp, the second largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, issupportive of such efforts.'Some sort of model where there was a partial payment overtime could work well,' Brennan said in an interview.THE PRICE OF PROGRESSGene therapy has been a target of Big Pharma for more than20 years, but research has been dogged by a series ofdisappointments and safety concerns. More recent scientificadvances have paved the way for the potentially life-changingtreatments.No gene therapies have been approved in the United States,but Europe approved its first gene therapy last year. Glyberatreats a rare disorder that clogs the blood with fat and hasbeen cleared for reimbursement in Germany at a price of 850,000euros, or around $1 million. It will be sold for a one-timepayment because it is too difficult to measure how well itworks, said Joern Aldag, CEO at Dutch biotech firm UniQure NV, which developed Glybera.Aldag said gene therapies for larger patient populations indevelopment at UniQure, including hemophilia and congestiveheart failure, would likely be priced on an amortized basis.'Gene therapy may be an initial very high burden for thehealthcare system,' Aldag said. 'The general consensus is thatasking for a one-off payment of over a million dollars becomesunacceptable.'U.S. health insurers and other group payers routinely payannual prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars for enzymereplacement therapies for extremely rare, 'orphan' diseases.BioMarin's Vimizin costs nearly $400,000 per year for a geneticdisorder that causes skeletal malformation and other problems.But insurers are much less willing to foot that kind of billfor drugs used in large numbers of patients. Last year, theypressured Gilead Sciences Inc to cut the $1,000per-pill cost of its new hepatitis C drug, saying the cost oftreating more than 3 million Americans infected with the viruswas unacceptable. Gilead said recently that it is discountingits prices by nearly 50 percent.About 20,000 Americans are estimated to have hemophilia,which is caused by a defect in a gene carried on the Xchromosome.'Distributing reimbursement over many years recognizes thefact that we don't know how long these (gene therapy treatments)are going to last,' said Dr James Wilson, a gene therapy expertat the University of Pennsylvania.

Reading the viral genetic sequence 'is a huge step forward in the fight to control the spread of Sars', said Dr Caroline Astell, projects leader at the Canadian centre.Her team began working around the clock to complete reading every genetic 'letter' of the sequence after receiving one millionth of a gram of purified genetic material belonging to the Sars coronavirus.The information, which has been posted on the Genome Sciences Centre's website (www.bcgsc.bc.ca), will lead to the development of definitive diagnostic tests for Sars, said Dr Marco Marra, the facility's director.At present, doctors worldwide diagnose Sars by a combination of unusual symptoms, including very high fever, difficulty breathing, a dry cough and contact with someone suspected of having the virus.In the longer term, sequencing the viral genome may allow scientists to understand why the Sars virus is so deadly, and may assist in the development of a vaccine.Many researchers think the virus, one of many that usually causes colds, may have mutated - perhaps as it moved from animals to people.Dr Steven Jones, head of bioinformatics at the Genome Sciences Centre, said: 'The next step for the Genome Sciences Centre is to analyse the proteins that the virus produces, to try to find clues for why this is such a virulent pathogen.'"

Research by US and Brazilian scientists gives new hope to the 250,000 Britons with type 1 diabetes who might expect to rely on the daily insulin injections to control their blood sugar levels for life. Without the jabs those with the condition can fall into a coma and die.         Researchers gave 15 newly-diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetics drugs to suppress their immune systems followed by transfusions of stem cells drawn from their own blood.         After treatment, 14 of the trial patients lost their insulin dependence and were able to discard their injection equipment.         One patient remained jab-free for almost three years, four for at least 21 months, and seven for at least six months. Two patients did not have to inject themselves for one and five months respectively. The findings, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, provide the first clinical evidence that type 1 diabetics can benefit from stem cell therapy.         The scientists wrote: 'Very encouraging results were obtained. Ninety-three per cent of patients achieved different periods of insulin independence and treatment-related toxicity was low, with no mortality.'         Previous studies have shown stem cell therapy might be a cure.         Diabetes is caused by insulin-producing cells in the pancreas being destroyed by the patient's immune system.         In the case of type 1 diabetes, it is thought stem cells may generate new immune system cells that avoid attacking the pancreas. The idea is to save what remains of a patient's beta cells.

They have eightprehensile, sucker-lined arms that they can use to grasp,manipulate and even, strangely enough, taste objects, as well ascomplex, camera-like eyes, and large, elaborate brains thatallow them to be active predators with complex behaviors.'The researchers sequenced the genome of the Californiatwo-spot octopus (scientific name Octopus bimaculoides), arelatively small, gray-brown species with two iridescent bluespots on each side of its head. It dwells off SouthernCalifornia's coast.Its genome was large, nearly the size of the human genomeand much bigger than those of other sequenced invertebrates suchas flies, snails or oysters.Among its roughly 33,000 genes, some 3,500 are found in noother type of animal, with many of these octopus-specific genesactive in the brain, suckers, retina and in camouflage ability.The genome was arranged differently than in otherinvertebrates and featured an expansion in a family of genesregulating nerve cell development that previously was thought tobe enlarged only in vertebrates.Octopuses are carnivorous, ripping prey with a hard beak,and can employ venom while hunting. They also can regeneratelost limbs and squirt dark ink to elude predators.The cephalopod lineage is ancient, arising more than half abillion years ago. The first octopuses appeared about 270million years ago. Today there are about 300 species.'We can now explore the molecular mechanisms of the octopus'unique development and its complex behaviors, and get a betterunderstanding of the evolutionary trajectory that led to them,'said University of Chicago neurobiology graduate student YanWang, another of the researchers.University of California Berkeley genetics professor DanielRokhsar said genome research is underway on other cephalopodsincluding the world's largest, the giant squid.

dailymail,1/6/2015 23:26,wires,"By Will DunhamWASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - Scientists have documented inFlorida a series of 'virgin births,' reproduction withoutmating, in a critically endangered sawfish species pushed to thebrink of extinction by over-fishing and habitat destruction.The scientists said on Monday it marks the first time thephenomenon called parthenogenesis has been seen in a vertebratein the wild. Some females may be resorting to asexualreproduction because smalltooth sawfish numbers are so low mating opportunities may not exist, they said.'There have been a number of cases in reptiles, birds andsharks of 'virgin birth' in captivity,' Stony Brook Universitymarine biologist Andrew Fields said. 'This raises many questionsabout how common this mode of reproduction is in the wild.'In parthenogenesis, a female's egg cell can develop into ababy without being fertilized by a male's sperm cell.In making an egg cell, a precursor cell divides into fourcells. The one that eventually becomes the egg cell retains keycellular structures and the gel-like cytoplasm. The other threehold extra genetic material.In parthenogenesis, one of those cells essentially acts as asperm cell and fuses with the egg. This 'fertilized' eggpossesses about half the mother's genetic diversity, a traitallowing parthenogenesis to be detected through genetic testing.Smalltooth sawfish are born and live for about three yearsin southwest Florida estuaries before moving into ocean coastalhabitats.The researchers were investigating sawfish inbreeding whenthey discovered seven, all healthy, born via parthenogenesis,about 3 percent of those examined.'It really surprised us,' said Kevin Feldheim, manager ofthe Pritzker Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Evolutionat Chicago's Field Museum. 'It is possible that numbers are solow that females have a hard time finding mates. In such asituation, parthenogenesis can be used as a last-ditch effortfor a female to pass on her genes.'Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission fishbiologist Gregg Poulakis said the sawfish came from the Peaceand Caloosahatchee rivers, which feed the Charlotte Harborestuary system.Sawfish, a type of ray, have a flattened shark-shaped bodyand a long, flat snout with pairs of teeth on the side used tofind, stun and kill prey. They grow up to 18 feet (5.5 meters)long.Their population collapse follows habitat loss and'unintentional' over-fishing, being caught in nets targetingother species. They received U.S. federal endangered speciesprotection in 2003.The research appears in the journal Current Biology. (Editing by Eric Walsh)"

I'd like to start my day off, without helping Monsanto,' sings Young in the music video for his new song.In one scene Young and his new band – Promise Of The Real – throw Starbucks cups at the camera.Young first pledged to stop drinking at Starbucks in November over attempts by the Grocery Manufactures Association to derail the first-in-the-nation law in Vermont.'I used to line up and get my latte every day, but yesterday was my last one,' Young wrote on his blog in a post titled GOODBYE STARBUCKS!!! on November 9.'Hiding behind the shadowy Grocery Manufacturers Association, Starbucks is supporting a lawsuit that's aiming to block a landmark law that requires genetically-modified ingredients be labeled,' Young wrote.'Amazingly, it claims that the law is an assault on corporations' right to free speech.'Starbucks, which is an 'affiliate member' of the GMA, has said it does not support the lawsuit and denies participating in it or aligning itself with Monsanto on the issue.'Starbucks is not a part of any lawsuit pertaining to GMO labeling nor have we provided funding for any campaign,' it said in a statement, while adding that as a chain it preferred a 'national solution' on the issue.Young has acknowledged that Starbucks has been progressive on other issues including labor conditions and gay rights. The coffee giant has also committed to reducing its climate change footprint.US biotech companies such as Monsanto have been at the forefront of genetically modified crops, which they say can improve agriculture.While common in the United States, genetically modified crops are banned or heavily regulated in many countries, including European Union members and Japan, due to public concerns.Young, has a long history of protesting about issues he is passionate about and in the mid-1980s he co-founded Farm Aid to help raise money for family farmers.Rock Star Bucks A Coffee Shop features on Young's upcoming anti-GMO concept album The Monsanto Years, which is being released on June 29. "

telegraph,26/03/2002 00:10,news,"CESAR MILSTEIN, who has died aged 74, was joint winner of the 1984 Nobel Prize for Medicine after his achievement in developing a method of producing tailor-made antibodies in large quantities in a laboratory.The discovery revolutionised bio-medical research and sparked an international billion-pound biotechnology industry. No other Medical Research Council scientist has made such an outstanding contribution to Britain's science, health and wealth creation.His discovery in 1975 of a method to mass-produce antibodies has led to ways of attacking cancer, diagnosing disease and detecting a pregnancy. He approached the National Research Development Corporation to patent the advance, but it notoriously wrote of his invention: 'It is certainly difficult for us to identify any immediate practical application which could be pursued as a commercial venture.' Even today, it is hotly debated how much the NRDC's decision cost the government.Antibodies are chemicals produced by blood cells called lymphocytes, which act as a natural defence against invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Lymphocytes turn out antibodies on demand that are tailor-made to attach themselves to, and destroy, particular invaders.By the early 1960s, scientists desperately wanted to find a laboratory method of producing pure antibodies against known agents. The problem was that lymphocytes would not grow in test tubes. Cancerous myeloma cells which make pure antibodies would, but no one knew what antibodies they were producing.Working at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, Milstein indirectly started work on this problem by taking an interest in the diversity of antibodies made by the body.He succeeded in developing techniques for fusing together myeloma cells from rats and mice; but the catalyst for his research was the arrival in Cambridge of a young post-doctoral researcher from Germany, Georges Kohler. Together, Milstein and Kohler discovered that a lymphocyte (making a known antibody) could be fused with a myeloma cell to produce a clone which turned out the same pure antibody as the parent lymphocyte, and yet had the hardiness of the cancer cell. This new cell, they found, could reproduce indefinitely - yielding unlimited quantities of a single pure antibody, the so-called monoclonal antibody.In 1975, Milstein and Kohler described the 'hybridoma' technique for producing monoclonal antibodies, for which in 1984 they won the Nobel Prize with the Danish-born scientist Niels Jerne, who did theoretical work on the body's protective immune system.Monoclonal antibodies are vital to scientists because they can be made to discriminate between closely related bacteria and viruses, normal and cancerous cells, or to home in on individual hormones and other key biological chemicals. They can be equipped with a marker to track them in the body, or even with a toxin to attack a cancerous cell.They are now widely used in medicine and biological research - as the basis of hundreds of diagnostic tests, in blood grouping, the matching of transplant tissues, and in the purification of substances such as interferon and the mapping of pathways to the brain. Monoclonal antibodies are also being used in research on mild illnesses as well as on serious diseases such as cancer, severe combined immune deficiency syndrome, and Aids. They are used to find cancers in the body that are too small to be identified in any other way and, in some cases, to kill them.The son of poor immigrants, Cesar Milstein was born on October 8 1927 in Bahia Blanca, Argentina. After attending the Colegio Nacional, Bahia Blanca, Cesar read Chemistry at Buenos Aires University. He spent as much time on student politics as he did in the laboratory. But after graduating he knuckled down to work for a doctoral degree under the direction of Professor Stoppani, professor of biochemistry at the university's medical school, supporting his studies by working part-time as a clinical biochemist. His thesis was on the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase.He was then granted a British Council fellowship to work under the supervision of Malcolm Dixon at the Department of Biochemistry at Cambridge. There he met and impressed Dr Fred Sanger, who had just won his first Nobel Prize for unravelling the sequence of amino acid building blocks in insulin.In 1961, Milstein returned to Buenos Aires to head a new molecular biology department in the National Microbiological Institute. A year later, Argentina's democratic government was toppled in a military coup, and the subsequent persecution of intellectuals manifested itself as a vendetta against the director of the Institute; he was sacked, and people in Milstein's department who defended him were sacked too. 'It was intolerable,' said Milstein, 'so I resigned.'Sanger had told Milstein to write to him if he ever wanted a job, and he did. The outcome was a post in the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. It was Sanger who suggested that Milstein should shift his attention from enzymes to immunology and work on antibodies.Milstein remained in Cambridge, and in 1983 became head of the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Division of the laboratory, and deputy director from 1988 until 1995. He continued his investigations into the genetic origin of antibody diversity and how antibodies acquire their ability to target specific invaders.During the 1990s, as the enormous commercial potential of monoclonal antibodies became clear, there was much criticism that the National Research and Development Council had decided against taking out a patent. Milstein originally proposed a patent, but later believed that this would have meant 'keeping everything secret while we thought about applications - an outrageous insult to science'. Had this been granted, it would have expired about now, just as monoclonal antibodies are becoming highly profitable.Milstein was a small, agile, sparrow-like man, and a convivial figure in Cambridge scientific circles. He habitually dressed in academic garb of corduroy trousers and casual shirts; out of doors he was often seen in a voluminous brown anorak.He was elected FRS in 1975, and appointed CH in 1995.Milstein married, in 1953, Celia Prilleltensky, an immunologist whom he had first met when they were fellow student radicals at Buenos Aires University."
telegraph,3/1/2005 0:01,expat,"Christine Doyle            From stem cell breakthroughs to new ways to beat wrinkles, Christine Doyle looks at the health trends that are set to improve our lives in 2005                              The importance of a good night's sleep                   Expect to hear much more in 2005 about the value of a good night's sleep to 'wake up' your mind and increase your brain power. Already, the concept of the mind gym is becoming popular, with psychologists offering corporate training in how to improve brain function.                       Sleep deprivation causes changes in the brain that are almost identical to those that occur naturally in people in their seventies and eighties, according to research by Professor Jim Horne, who heads the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University.           'These changes, which are in the hardworking frontal part of the brain's cortex, affect decision-making and the ability to absorb and adapt to new information. People who are affected tend to talk more in clichés and become more rigid in their thinking,' says Prof Horne, whose book on the subject will be published later this year. 'A tired junior doctor at the end of a long shift, for example, could be in danger of making a mistake, if faced with unexpected symptoms that stretch his deductive powers.'          For young people, a good night's sleep will restore the brain to full power, and Horne thinks it is a key responsibility of employers to ensure that their staff do not work exhaustively long hours. Even a power nap in a workplace sleep zone – an American idea that is on its way here – could help in a crisis.                      Build up brain power                   Prof Horne's research has uncovered good news for those worried about declining brain power. You don't have to 'use it or lose it' by reading weighty, intellectual books or doing crosswords.           'The answer is to stimulate the brain by bombarding it with interesting information. Have fun sightseeing, go to art galleries and the theatre, travel, surf the net, window-shop and talk about what interests you.          'The latest idea is that other parts of the brain take over from the declining frontal cortex during sleep to reorganise the fresh information gathered during the day. New neural connections are forged, we believe, during the first few hours of deep sleep.'                      Look after the heart                   This year will bring a Europe-wide drive to encourage people to reduce their cholesterol and blood pressure levels, according to Professor John Martin, director of the centre for cardiovascular biology and medicine at University College London.           'The aim is to develop a heart plan to reduce everyone's cholesterol level to below the present average of just above five units per litre of blood.'           At least one third of the population has been diagnosed with high blood pressure or levels at the high end of normal.           'The Irish government and the European Society of Cardiology [ESC] are co-operating with EU ministers on how this plan might work,' says Prof Martin, who is chairman of the EU relations committee of the ESC.           For GPs, who are already weary of trying to achieve targets, the idea might sound alarming but, says Prof Martin, 'we don't want to tell people what to do; we want to establish guidelines. Some countries might mount healthier eating and exercise campaigns, others might encourage doctors to use their influence with patients by taking a more active role in testing and advising. Reducing the numbers affected by heart disease, strokes and adult onset diabetes continues to be the key public health issue.'                      A pill for your ears                   Progress is expected this year in developing a pill to protect ears against induced hearing loss. Loud music, noisy occupations and some drugs, including those used to treat cancer, can damage cells in the sound-sensitive hairs of the ear canal.           'We are very excited by the development and hope to hear soon about the results of clinical trials in America,' says a spokesman for the Royal National Institute for the Deaf.                      Complementary medicine closes the gap                   'Complementary medicine is reaching a turning point in its relationship with mainstream medicine,' says George Lewith, a GP and senior research fellow at Southampton University who straddles both worlds. 'One in 10 people use it and about half of those are lifelong users. Now, the latest scientifically based studies provide convincing evidence that therapies do work.'                      Trials with Chinese acupuncture showed that it significantly reduces the pain of osteoarthritis and improves mobility. 'Confidence in the findings is attracting new research money, including grants from the Department of Health,' says Lewith.          This year, he expects good news for people who take glucosamine to keep their knee and hip joints supple. 'The studies will prove that consistently taking between 1.2 and 1.5 g a day reduces the need for a hip or knee replacement in those with established osteoarthritis.'                      Stem cell tissue repair                   Stem cell research is keeping both medics and patients in suspense. Stem cells are those extracted from tissues that have the potential to grow into new cells in other tissues. The growth of such cells could help those with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's. They might even help to restore vision and cure diabetes. Japanese doctors are conducting studies using stem and fat cells to reconstruct breasts, in the hope that they might be used after breast cancer.           'During 2005,' says Prof Martin, 'we expect to start a trial using stem cells extracted from the patient's own bone marrow to repair damaged blood vessels or other tissues following a heart attack.           'Studies in Germany show the procedure is safe, but we do not yet know how the stem cells work.'                      Valentine's heart-to-heart                   After years spent urging us to look after our health to minimise the risk of suffering a heart attack, the British Heart Foundation will take a new tack this year. Its Valentine's Day campaign is called 'Living with Heart Failure', in recognition of the fact that many who survive heart disease may later develop heart failure. Finding a drug or technique to prevent this complication is high on the research agenda, says the BHF.           For more information, see: www.bhf.org.uk                               Holistic fitness          If you depend on workouts to give you mental and physical energy but are becoming bored with gym sessions, what are the new options?          'We will see a more natural and holistic approach, with an emphasis on outdoor activities that get people together,' says personal trainer Matt Roberts.           'There will be a push towards trail running, which is a wonderful activity – a favourite of Robbie Williams. You put work out of your mind and run, at your own pace, up and down mountain and hill trails, along river banks or through woodlands, parks or fields. Instead of focusing on timing, you take in your environment and are not so breathless that you cannot speak to your companions.' It is acceptable to slow down or even walk some of the time.          Roberts also forecasts a surge of interest in triathlon events. 'These involve stints of swimming, cycling and running, pitched at all levels. For those looking for something beyond road and marathon running, they offer a stimulating alternative.'           For more information, see: www.britishtriathlon.org                   Trail Running Association: www.tra-uk.org                               Cat allergy vaccine                   This summer, a vaccine that helps people who are allergic to cats will be tested. Thousands of adults are affected and the symptoms of about half of the 1.5 million asthmatic children in Britain are triggered by cats.          'This is the first cat allergy vaccine to get close to commercial production,' says Dr Mark Larché of the Imperial College of Medicine, London.           'About 60 people will take part in the trials, which will take about 18 months. I am confident that the vaccine will live up to its promise. It works by making the immune system more tolerant to the antigen in cats' saliva. If successful, we should be able to apply the same principle against the house dustmite.'                      The pharmacy: first stop for a health check                   More pharmacists will offer an increasing range of health check-ups, including blood pressure and cholesterol monitoring. Many are also liaising more closely with primary care trusts to provide appropriate checks.           From March, free leg scans will be offered nationwide at large pharmacies. Nurses will carry out leg examinations and show people how to spot signs of disease, such as varicose veins and swollen legs and ankles, and how to avoid deep vein thrombosis.

But many saw it as part of a move to give patients greater choice and autonomy, and expand the role of pharmacists as advisers.          Chloramphenicol antibiotic eye drops, which are used to treat conjunctivitis, are next in line for over-the-counter sales. They are safe and effective, and this decision will make it much easier for patients to get treatment as soon as they need it. Other drugs under consideration include those for asthma, raised blood pressure and obesity.                      Intelligent hip replacement                    A 'smart' hip replacement joint with tiny surface sensors that detect and identify the bacteria involved in infection following surgery is being developed at the Allegheny Singer Research Institute in Pittsburgh.           The hip would release an antibiotic from a tiny internal supply, and report on the control of infection via a wireless link. This system would eradicate the need for the distressing removal and subsequent replacement of a new hip in up to three per cent of hip replacement patients. It might prove costly, though, for the NHS.                      Alzheimer's drug to ease Parkinson's disease                   Trials using Exelon, an Alzheimer's drug, suggest it might slow late-stage dementia in some of those suffering from advanced Parkinson's. 'The drug could help carers to cope more easily, though it is not yet licensed for this use,' says a spokesman for the Parkinson's Disease Society.                      Natural treatment to smooth wrinkles                   Keep an eye out in the spring for Evolence, a new, so-called natural injection to beat wrinkles. It is said to be long-lasting, and the developers are keeping the details a close secret. It is bound to be expensive.                      Campaigns against smoking                   Expect a hard-hitting government campaign this spring, urging smokers to be alert to developing a smoker's cough. It can be the prelude to chronic lung disease and is a potential sign of lung cancer.           There will also be a renewed effort by Action on Smoking and Health, the British Lung Foundation and the British Medical Association to persuade the Government to legislate for a total ban on smoking in public places, as in Ireland, rather than the present proposals, which permit some exceptions."
telegraph,12/8/2004 0:01,news,"Cloning of human embryos will help scientists to understand many diseases, develop new drug tests that do not require animals and may lead to new treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's among a wide range of disorders.          In principle, stem cells isolated from an early embryo can be used to make any of the 200 or so cell types in the body.          They can be used to study a disease process, test treatments, replace cells lost as a result of illness or injury, perhaps even grow organs.          The Newcastle team aims to clone early human embryos using the 'nuclear transfer' procedure developed by Dr Ian Wilmut and his colleagues to create Dolly the sheep.          The human cloning project will use some of the 2,000 eggs left over from test tube baby fertility treatment every year at the Newcastle Fertility Centre at Life with full consent from the donors.          Because the NHS does not fund freezing, the team has a large supply of fresh eggs which raise the chance of success in cloning.          DNA is removed from an egg and genetic material imported from the nucleus of a normal skin cell or from Newcastle's existing stem cell line.          After the transfer, the 'reprogrammed' egg will be stimulated to divide into a sandgrain-sized ball of 100 or so cells destined to form both the embryo and placenta.          From the inner cell mass - cells destined to become the embryo - cells will be extracted and cultured for stem cell research, nurtured by human fibroblast cells (most other groups use mouse cells raising concerns about cross infection) to ensure that cells can be used for treatments.          One purpose is to improve the overall efficiency of cloning: the first properly documented effort by a team in South Korea used 242 human eggs to derive a single stem cell line.          The other aim of the original application - to clone cells from a Type 1 diabetic to understand better the mechanism of diabetes - has been dropped.          Although satisfied that cloning embryos would advance understanding of embryonic development and developing new treatments, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority committee was unconvinced that enough was known to justify cloning to treat diabetes.          'We must act within the law,' said Suzi Leather, the authority's chairman.          Prof Alison Murdoch, of the Newcastle team, said the authority 'have to ensure they are covered legally.          A pressure group suggested it (the original application) might not be in the terms of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.         ' But she believed there are 'no major issues' and does not believe diabetes research will be delayed by the decision to curb the original application so a licence could be granted more quickly.          'We can get on with the preliminary work and the issue about diabetes will be reviewed in the near future.'"

Better known for its idyllic tropical beaches and lush cloud forests, Costa Rica's many hospitals and clinics have made medical tourism one of the fastest growing segments of its tourism sector, the motor of its economy.They lure tens of thousands of foreigners seeking surgery, dental work, cancer treatment, cosmetic surgery, and dozens of other procedures at a fraction of their cost in the United States.Until this week, one of those draws was stem cell treatment, using master cells gleaned from umbilical cords, fat and elsewhere.The health ministry last month ordered the country's largest stem cell clinic to stop offering treatments, arguing there is no evidence that the treatments work or are safe.'If (stem cell treatment's) efficiency and safety has not been proven, we don't believe it should be used,' said Dr. Ileana Herrera, chief of the ministry's research council. 'As a health ministry, we must always protect the human being.The clinic's owner, Arizona entrepreneur Neil Riordan, said that he closed the clinic and admitted the treatments, involving the removal and re-injection of stem cells, had not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.'I think her point was that it is not FDA approved,' he said.The ministry said the clinic had a permit to store the adult stem cells, extracted from patients' own fat tissue, bone marrow and donated umbilical cords, but was not authorised to perform the treatment.Some of his patients were outraged that the clinic was forced to close.'I think it's ridiculous, in all honesty,' said Cranston Rodgers, from Las Vegas, who received treatment from the clinic three years ago for an aggressive case of multiple sclerosis.'I know what it did for me. I haven't used a cane or a scooter since I used the first treatment.'Since Riordan's Institute of Cellular Medicine opened in 2006, about 400 foreigners, mostly from the United States, have undergone the experimental treatment unavailable in North America and Europe to treat multiple sclerosis, spinal injuries, diabetes and other ailments.

This used to be the stuff of classical mythology, and later of science fiction. At last, like human beings flying thousands of feet above the Earth, or a man having the capability to lay waste thousands of square miles of the planet in a single act, it has become possible.          We are, of course, some way from having centaurs, or even from that hideous scene in Lindsay Anderson's O Lucky Man where a man is seen convulsing, in shocking illness, in his hospital bed: the counterpane is pulled back to reveal that his head has been grafted on to a sheep. At least, I hope we are. For those who propose mixing man and beast, it is only a question of creating an embryo, not as they see it a living being. Also, the embryo is to be 99.9 per cent human and 0.1 per cent cow (if this were not so serious and alarming a subject we could reflect that many of our fellow men are already considerably more bovine than that, but the taste of such an observation is, in these circumstances, questionable).          Should a licence be granted by the HFEA to grow such an embryo, it would be destroyed after 14 days, when no bigger than a pinhead. Therapeutic cloning such as this has hitherto been carried out using human eggs from consenting IVF patients, but they are now in short supply. There is a separate argument here about how, since we allow experimentation on embryos, we ought also to allow an open market in eggs, creating a price mechanism, and then there would be no shortages. However, the matter in hand, of crossing the boundary between human life and animal life, is too worthy of our attention today for us to be detained by economics.          In that oddly amusing dinner-party game about things you are least likely to hear a certain person say, we know what the answer is for the scientist: 'I've just put the genie back in the bottle.' That was always the danger of embryo experiments, which were legalised in 1990 as a result of the Warnock report into the subject in 1984. Her committee decided by just one vote to recommend embryo experimentation for the purposes of IVF for up to 14 days.          The following year, Enoch Powell had tried, and only just failed, to have Parliament pass a Private Member's Bill outlawing the practice. I can still see his shocked visage as he spoke of his 'repugnance' at the idea of toying with the stuff of life in this way. The Thatcher government, then in power, was in favour of experimentation. The Secretary of State responsible, Norman (now Lord) Fowler, and his deputy, Kenneth Clarke, both voted against a ban. It was seen as the progressive – we would now say modern – thing to do.          It was a time when the passion for the right to have children was at its apogee. The first test-tube baby had been born in 1978, but there was now a strong appetite for further research to help those unable to conceive even by that method. Powell and his considerable band of supporters were dismissed, with varying degrees of contempt, as religious nutters and fundamentalists standing in the way of progress and (therefore) happiness. From 1990, the scientists had their way.          Powell's fears about genies and bottles were well founded. The 1990 Human Embryology and Fertilisation Act was not the end of it. In 2001, the HFEA agreed to therapeutic cloning, showing that embryo experiments were not only about improving the ability of human beings to reproduce. This new research would explore the fight against disease and would help develop treatments. In 2002, the HFEA granted the first licence to allow the development of stem cell lines on donated embryos. Then, in 2004, it allowed the creation of human embryonic stem cells using therapeutic cloning.          The chemistry-set mentality that Powell and his supporters feared has now taken root. I recall him saying to me, while his Bill was being debated, that he feared a time when human reproduction would be more or less divorced from humans; that, as well as conception taking place in a laboratory, the resulting foetus would then be grown there. Knowing he would be ridiculed for scaremongering, Powell never said this in public. But who, now, would bet on his being wrong?          Indeed, the opponents of embryo experimentation in the 1980s never imagined that cross-species embryos (even ones killed at 14 days when no bigger than a pinhead) would ever be contemplated. Fundamentalists argue against embryo experimentation not least because it results, at 14 days, in the killing of something that they regard as human life itself. They have a point. What we are now talking about, however, is the killing of something at 14 days that is neither human nor animal, but a disturbing combination of both.          We are reassured, though, by Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, of the National Institute for Medical Research, that this mongrelisation of our species 'is a very rational step: to learn what you can using animal eggs, which are readily obtainable, before moving on to valuable human eggs when or if this becomes necessary'. Note how, perhaps because he is on the defensive, the Professor puts the 'very' in front of the incomparable adjective 'rational'.          Something either is rational or it isn't, and the rationality of mixing a man with a cow won't seem cut and dried in its obviousness to most people. And the professor's ideas, entailing as they would a quantum leap in how far the genie has travelled from the bottle, prompt the worrying thought that it might, in other hands, have far farther to go yet.          Then there is Dr Stephen Minger, of King's College, London, who wants to use cloned hybrid embryos to research into such afflictions as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and spinal muscular dystrophy. No sane person can want anything but to know more about what causes such diseases, and how they might be warded off: but is the violation of the species a price we are prepared to pay?          Stem cell research was a big issue in America's mid-term elections. The Republicans, with their element of the religious Right, are against it. This is one of those rare subjects on which our Government and America's disagree. Our ministers talk up stem cell research as a growth industry for Britain, and we all know how we must be ever on the alert for new ways of making money. Given the political enthusiasm for such research, it may well be that Tony Blair, if asked, would pronounce in favour of the man-cow embryo. It would sit oddly with his apparent affection for the Roman Catholic Church, but then so does his studied vagueness about abortion.          You do not, though, have to be a religious maniac to see the disturbing aspects of mixing human life with animal life in this way. I don't have a religious bone in my body, and the prospect horrifies me. No doubt if we don't do it someone else will: the Chinese are very keen on this sort of thing. Equally, no doubt one day somebody will grow a beast that has horns and a tail, but enjoys listening to Mozart and reads Noddy books, or even simply dormant human beings for spare-part surgery. And perhaps that will seem 'rational', or even 'very rational', at the time. How wonderful it would be to have a cure for Alzheimer's: but how wonderful it would be, equally, to have enshrined a proper respect for life itself, and for the nature of our being."
telegraph,5/1/2002 0:01,news,"DOLLY the sheep suffers from an unusual form of arthritis rarely found in ewes her age, raising concerns that cloning could trigger premature ageing.Professor Ian Wilmut, the leader of the British team that created Dolly, said the ailment was likely to be linked to the cloning process and called for more research into the long-term health of clones.But he added that Dolly's pampered 'celebrity' lifestyle, which has included overfeeding from visitors, might also have taken its toll.Animal welfare campaigners said the discovery proved that cloning was cruel.Dolly, the first mammal cloned from a single cell from an adult animal, is enjoying an early retirement at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, where she was born in 1996.Shortly before Christmas she became lame in the left hind leg. X-rays at the University of Edinburgh confirmed that she had arthritis in the hip and knee and she was given anti-inflammatory drugs to ease discomfort.Tim King, a Roslin vet, said: 'Arthritis in sheep is quite common, but it is comparatively unusual for it to be in these joints. In all other ways, Dolly is in good health and she has produced six healthy lambs.'Prof Wilmut said the discovery of Dolly's ailment was a disappointment. The unusual nature of the arthritis meant it was 'likely' to be linked to a limitation in the cloning process.'It is not possible to know if her condition is in any way a result of her being a clone,' he said.'However, this occurrence emphasises the need to monitor the health of a considerable number of clones throughout their expected lifespan to discover if any condition normally associated with age develops in unusually young animals.'Dolly's arthritis highlights the difficulty in cloning. Most clones die before birth or are born with oversized organs and weakened immune systems. Dolly was the only successful clone out of 247 attempts.One of the key unanswered questions about Dolly is her true 'genetic' age. Although she was born in 1996, all the cells in her body sprung from a single cell in a six-year-old ewe. To complicate things, the donor's udder tissue had been cultured in a laboratory before use.In 1999 researchers found evidence that she may be ageing prematurely. Scientists at PPL Therapeutics, the company that worked with the Roslin Institute to create Dolly, looked at structures in her cells called telomeres. Made from protein and nucleic acid, these cap the ends of chromosomes, protecting them from fraying.Telomeres have been linked to the natural life cycle of cells. Each time a cell divides, the telomeres become shorter until, after a predetermined number of divisions, they crumble away, allowing the cell to die.Dolly's telomeres appear to be shorter than normal, suggesting that she may be genetically older than chronological age.Sarah Kite, of the British Union of Anti Vivisectionists, said: 'Scientists seem to think that they can they can mix and match animals' genes in a controlled way; but actually the control is an illusion.'No one yet understands exactly how genes work or what the effects will be on the innocent animals who are subjected to biotechnology.'Just to produce Dolly involved the wastage of hundreds of sheep who did not survive or who developed deformities and were miscarried because cloning technology is imperfect.'This week, PPL Therapeutics announced the birth of five cloned piglets, born without a specific gene, which should help to prevent their organs being rejected by humans.Shares in PPL Therapeutics fell by about 15 per cent after news of Dolly's illness yesterday, losing some of the gains on Wednesday on news of the piglets' birth.Earlier this year, Advanced Cell Techology, an American biotechnology company, released a report on 24 cows cloned four years ago. Although it concluded that all were healthy, other scientists said it was too soon to say whether they were ageing prematurely."
telegraph,7/9/2014 7:00,news,"Europe's 'hostile' attitude to scientific advancement risks leaving Britain in the 'slow lane' of medical development, the new life science minister George Freeman has warned Medical advancements like ‘The 100,000 Genome Project’ risk being derailed by   ‘hostile’ European regulation, the new life sciences minister has warned. Britain is leading the world in genetic research and personalised medicine,   but is being hindered by increasing interference from the European   Commisson, George Freeman told The Daily Telegraph. Mr Freeman, who was appointed as the UK’s first life sciences minister in the   recent cabinet reshuffle, said it would be a ‘disaster’ for NHS patients if   Europe continued to condemn Britain to the ‘global slow lane’ of medical   innovation. He warned that 'increasingly unhelpful' red tape was holding up vital clinical   trials while new data protection laws risk preventing medical records being   gathered for research. 'There are a number of areas where the UK and NHS is pioneering but EU   regulation is in danger of holding back biomedical advances: in regenerative   medicine, stem cells, genetics and data,' said Mr Freeman. “There are a whole serious of directives which they are looking at which would   basically risk making Europe, and therefore Britain in Europe, an   increasingly unattractive place to do modern medicine and science and that   would be a disaster for Britain and NHS patients. 'We need the EU to put in a place a supportive regulatory framework to   maximise benefits for patients and taxpayers. 'This is an area the UK leads and I will be reaching out the European   governments and to the commission to highlight the work Britain is doing to   shape this new landscape.”Last year the European Commission announced a reform of the existing data   protection legislation which would give people the right to know every time   their records are accessed from medical databases. Mr Freeman warned the new regulations could damage the government’s ‘100,000   Genome Project’, which is aiming to sequence tens of thousands of   genomes to map the genetic profile of thousands of rare diseases and   cancers. It could also harm the new Care:Data   scheme which will see all NHS patients’ medical records moved to one central   database so they can be accessed by research institutions. “The new EU rules could pose a serious threat to these ambitions,” he said. Researchers would have to apply for “specific, informed and explicit consent”   every time they wanted to look at individual records, a measure that could   tie-up scientists in so much red tape as to render the projects useless. The European Commission's 2001 Clinical Trials Directive has already   contributed to a 25 per cent decline in the number of new trials undertaken   in the EU between 2007 and 2011. During the same period administrative costs have risen by 98 per cent and   insurance costs by 800 per cent. The average delay for launching a clinical   trial has increased 90 per cent to 152 days. Mr Freeman said it was vital that trials on technologies like mitochondrial   DNA transfer – in which donor DNA from a 'second mother' to be implanted   into a defective egg – are allowed to go ahead. “There is very strong consensus from all parties that we should get on this   because children our dying unnecessarily of rare diseases,” he said. But 34 members of the Council of Europe have warned that Britain may be   breaching The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural   Organisation's (UNESCO) Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human   Rights because the genetic alteration would be passed down through   generations. Mr Freeman is calling for greater freedom for Britain to be able to determine   its own medical and science policies. However he believes that healthcare in the UK is undergoing a ‘quiet   revolution’ which will see it become the most advanced in the world. “My mission is to make Britain in the 21st century the best place in the world   to discover design and develop modern medicines and healthcare technology;   to harness the extraordinary power of biomedical science and research, to   accelerate the development of the new generation of diagnostics, drugs and   preventative therapies,” he said. “We’re the first country in the world to pioneer a genomic medicine service   based on sequencing the entire genome. People have done big studies of   little snips. We’re building the platform here to make Britain the pioneer. “21st century medicine and healthcare will not just come from the drug but   from the smart delivery of the drug, site-specific deliver. There’s an   extraordinary revolution of remote sensing, remote diagnostics. “Today’s 20 and 30 years olds will expect their healthcare to be digital.   There is a noble collective health mission here which goes right to the   heart of the DNA of the NHS.”"
telegraph,24/01/2008 19:04,news,"Experiments to create the first man-made organism have started in the wake of the successful creation of the genetic code of a living thing from laboratory chemicals.                                                       In the beginning...how to create synthetic life                                                                        Craig Venter: Creating life in a lab using DNA                                                                        Craig Venter reads his entire DNA 'recipe book'                                              The first artificial genetic code - the software of life - and how to make it from scratch from four kinds of chemical is unveiled today by an American team, marking the completion of the second of three steps towards the dawn of synthetic life.          Efforts to finish the final step of transplanting the synthetic DNA into a cell are under way, though it takes some weeks to work out if a transplant has been successful.          A team of 17 researchers at the J Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland, describes in the journal Science how it has successfully created the largest man-made DNA structure, indeed the largest synthetic molecule, the circular genetic code of an artificial bacterium that it is now trying to breed in the lab.          The scientists led by the human genome pioneer Dr Craig Venter want to create new kinds of bacterium, living chemical factories if you like, to make new types of bugs which can be used as green fuels to replace oil and coal, digest toxic waste or absorb carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.          The feat will trigger excitement and unease in equal measure along with widespread debate about the ethics of creating new species, which Dr Venter believes will be a major step in the history of our species. One critic of what some call Synthia put it more trenchantly: 'God has competition.'          Rumours have circulated for weeks that they have achieved the feat but, speaking from Davos, Switzerland, Dr Venter tells The Daily Telegraph: 'No we have not. There are a number of serious constraints on that happening and we are working diligently to get rid of them.          'If we had succeeded it would be part of this paper. As soon as we have it, I doubt that we would be able to keep it a secret. Nor would we want to.'          But he believes success is only 'a matter of time.'          The genetic codes - genomes - of all organisms are written in the chemical language of DNA and Dr Venter's team used lab methods to make all 582,970 letters of a slightly modified version of the genome of a genital bacterium, Mycoplasma genitalium JCVI-1.0.          The name underlines how Dr Venter wants to rewrite the software of life so it can still run on the hardware of an existing bacterial cell.          Standard methods can only make tiny DNA snippets. Today's technical tour de force, the fruits of an effort launched at the start of 2003, has created a huge ring of DNA that is more than 10 times bigger than earlier attempts, a milestone towards the goal of creating a fully-synthetic organism that is able to self replicate.          To achieve today's 'very exciting' milestone, his team made DNA fragments in the lab into larger pieces using new methods for the assembly and reproduction of the DNA segments. After several years of work perfecting chemical assembly, the team found they could harness the process that cells use to repair damage to their chromosomes to complete the job.          The team, which now includes Dan Gibson, Clyde Hutchison and the Nobel laureate Ham Smith, has already started its attempt to create a living cell based entirely on the synthetic DNA code as part of an effort to find out which of its genes are essential for life, crucial for efforts to understand how life works.          'This extraordinary accomplishment is a technological marvel,' said Dr Venter, paying tribute to his team that has 'dedicated the last several years to designing and perfecting new methods and techniques that we believe will become widely used to advance the field of synthetic genomics.'          The letters of DNA - chemical building blocks called adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T) - are not easy chemicals to artificially synthesise into chromosomes. As the strands of DNA get longer they get increasingly brittle, making them more difficult to work with.          Before today's publication, the largest synthesised piece of DNA contained only 32,000 letters of code. Ham Smith says: 'We have shown that building large genomes is now feasible and scalable so that important applications such as biofuels can be developed.' However, such work would use other kinds of bacteria.          Jim Thomas of the ETC group (Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) called on Dr Venter to slow down so that society could take on board the wider implications.         'Venter is claiming bragging rights to the world's longest length of synthetic DNA, but size isn't everything. The important question is not 'how long?' but 'how wise?'' says Thomas.         'While synthetic biology is speeding ahead in the lab and in the marketplace, societal debate and regulatory oversight is stalled and there has been no meaningful or inclusive discussion on how to govern synthetic biology in a safe and just way. In the absence of democratic oversight profiteering industrialists are tinkering with the building blocks of life for their own private gain. We regard that as unacceptable.'         Rev Thomas Nairn, professor of Catholic ethics at the Catholic Theological Union, tells the Chicago Tribune:  'From a religious point of view the creation of new viruses or bacteria would not necessarily create a huge problem, depending on how they're used. The two major principles are to do no harm, and do the work respectfully.'         Prof George Church, a Harvard Medical School geneticist leading a rival effort, says the Science paper 'is not a test of vitalism. It's an assembly paper.         'Right now, all they've done is shown they can buy a bunch of DNA and put it together,' he says, adding the real question is whether it is faster or cheaper than alternative ways to engineer useful organism: 'They don't lay out their economics. They missed an opportunity.'         Prof Eckard Wimmer, State University of New York, Stony Brook,  who led an effort to construct synthetic polio, comments: 'The ultimate step is proving what they have synthesised is biologically active.'         'Unfortunately, this very critical point is missing here,' he says, adding that he was left with 'the unpleasant feeling whether or not the synthetic DNA was indeed proper and able for biological function.'         But the work of Venter's team is a 'seminal achievement,' says Prof Daphne Preuss at the University of Chicago and Chromatin Inc, a biotech firm that is studying ways of synthesising small chromosomes for plants.         The work represents a 'technological tour de force,' adds Prof Pamela   Silver, at Harvard Medical School.         And Eddy Rubin, director of the Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute, California, says of the overall goal to engineer more useful forms of life: 'I think it's one of the important steps that have to be achieved.'

telegraph,23/12/2014 07:00,news,"Genetic data centres across the country will save lives and offer hope to millions moreDuring a conversation I had with a doctor a couple of years ago, the subject   of cancer diagnoses came up, in a tangential way. She said that not all that   many decades ago, a physician who had established that a patient had cancer   often wouldn’t bother investigating further: since there weren’t any   effective treatments for any kind of cancer, there wasn’t much point in   finding out what kind of cancer it was. You could try to cut it out, or you   could leave it in and see what happened, and that was about it. Now, of course, that has changed. It matters what cancer you have, because   different cancers respond differently to different treatments. As we get   better at treating the disease, it pushes us to get better at   differentiating them; as we establish the various kinds, it allows us to   target drugs more precisely at the ones they work on, so that the drugs   themselves become more effective. There is a virtuous circle between   diagnostics and treatment that improves both. That’s   why the news that the NHS is to open 11 major “genomics centres”–   with more to follow – around the country is so hugely positive. Over the past few years, genomics – the study of our genetic code – has taken   off in spectacular style: while it took decades and billions of pounds to   sequence the first human genome, now the information in a human cell can be   catalogued in a few days for about a grand. This, obviously, opens up huge   possibilities for medicine. It renders it practical to record and analyse   the genetic code of thousands of people, and to see how small differences in   our DNA change our vulnerability to different diseases. And that’s exactly what the NHS plan, with Genomics England, involves. The   centres will take the genetic data of 100,000 people, all suitably   anonymised, and analyse and record them, making them available to   researchers at universities and drug firms. They will also sequence the DNA   of 25,000 cancer sufferers, and the DNA of the cancers themselves. Cancer is   a disease of the genes – the product of mutations which send the cell into   uncontrolled reproduction – and establishing which genes are vulnerable to   which mutations will be vital in defeating its various incarnations. This has possibilities far beyond cancer, though. To a startling degree, we   are freed from the crippling burden of infectious disease. That’s not the   case in developing countries, where more than half of all deaths are caused   by infection, according to the World Health Organisation; but in the rich   West, nearly nine out of 10 of us will die of a non-communicable disease,   when something simply goes wrong with our bodies. Sometimes that something   goes wrong because of environmental factors – smoking, drinking, obesity –   and sometimes we’re just unlucky, but our risk of suffering pretty much any   non-communicable disease, from heart disease to diabetes to stroke, is   influenced by our genes. If we can see which genes tend to be associated   with which diseases, doctors can help those at the greatest risk to take   steps to avoid it. An obvious example is breast cancer, which oncologists now think of as at   least 10 different diseases. While the average lifetime risk for a woman in   the UK is about 12.5 per cent, according to Cancer Research UK, if they have   a particular mutation in a gene called BRCA1, that risk goes up to between   60 and 90 per cent. Angelina Jolie was tested and found to have this   mutation, and chose to have a double mastectomy as a preventive measure.   Less dramatically, statins could be prescribed specifically to those people   who are found to be more susceptible to high blood pressure or heart   disease, instead of – as now – giving them to a huge swath of the population   in order to help the minority who actually need them. It is the difference   between a sniper rifle and a shotgun. The trick with the genomics revolution will be tying it in to the everyday   business of health care in England, and that is where these centres will   become vital. When doctors are able to look at a patient’s genetic   information as easily as they can their height and weight, they will be able   to target those patients with the interventions that will work best on them   – true individualised medicine. But that involves making genome sequencing   routine, calming understandable fears about privacy, and convincing people   to take that first scary step and look at what their genes hold in store for   them. A year or so after my conversation with the doctor about cancer, a close   relative was diagnosed with malignant melanoma. It was a horrible,   terrifying time. Skin cancer comes in various forms, many of them relatively   benign, but melanoma is a killer. And until recently there were no drugs   that were effective against it. If caught early, it could be cut off, and   you were usually all right; later, once it had got into your system, you   were in real trouble. Like the cancers a century ago, there was little point   knowing more about what kind of melanoma it was, because you couldn’t do   much about it. Luckily (touch wood) my relative’s cancer was caught early, and the prognosis   is good. But if, heaven forfend, it comes back, there are now drugs that can   be used, with some success – and the choice of which drug depends on your   genes. The genomic revolution is already transforming medicine, and saving   the lives of people right now. This is an extraordinary time for medicine. "
telegraph,30/10/2014 00:01,news,"Genetically modified crops are being blocked on political rather than scientific grounds, botanists warn, as they call on Europe to end regulationThe widespread cultivation of genetically modified crops is the only way to   feed the world and governments must stop blocking trials, a consortium of   Europe’s most well-renowned plant scientists have claimed. In an open letter to the European Parliament ahead of a debate on GM next   week, more than 20 of the most eminent botanists and ecologists in the world   warn that it is time to put fears of genetic modification aside and begin   widespread field trials. They call for a ‘fundamental revision of GM regulation’ which, they claim, is   based not on science, but on politics. Signatory Professor Jonathan Jones, of the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich,   says British scientists are creating world-changing crops, but they are   being blocked by Europe. Prof Jones has developed a blight resistant potato which would avoid the need   for farmers to spray crops 15 times a year. Blight is the number one threat to the six million tonnes of potatoes produced   in Britain each year and was responsible for the Irish Famine of 1840s. But European approval is needed for commercial cultivation and so far the   Council of Ministers has vetoed every application. Prof Jones said: “It’s incredibly frustrating. It deters scientists from doing   the work in the first place because they know that it won’t get approved. “Even when the science is approved by the European Food Standards Agency, it   goes to the Council of Ministers who are inevitably split on political   grounds and then it stalls.“Britain is fairly enlightened compared with the rest of Europe and will allow   initial trials, but Europe cannot seem to get its ducks all in a row so we   can move forward.”GM crops have polarised opinion since they were first produced by American   scientists in 1982. Activists claim they could cause cancer, damage   ecosystems and cross-pollinate with grasses to produce “super-weeds”. Most scientists now agree that there is little evidence to suggest that crops   are dangerous to humans or the environment. They could even be more   beneficial to health and add nutrients to the genetic make-up of plants. In Britain, just one small field trial is currently taking place. Rothamsted   Research in Hertforshire is growing a crop of camelina (false flax) which   has been spliced with genes which make Omega-3 so that its seeds will   produce an oil rich in fatty acid normally only found in fish. But the letter warns that, 'in most European countries permits to perform   field experiments with transgenic plants are blocked, not on scientific but   on political grounds.' The authors call for Europe to allow individual countries to opt out of   growing crops. It would mean that countries like Britain could begin   commercial production while those who oppose the idea, like France, would   not be forced to follow suit. The proposals will go before the European Parliament next week. “We all depend on plants for providing us with food, building material,   textiles, medicine and fuel,” the authors write. “Among the greatest challenges facing mankind are the provision of healthy and   nutritious food, feed and fuel to a burgeoning population using agricultural   and forestry practices that are environmentally and economically   sustainable. “Plant scientists must be able to perform field experiments. Many of us work   with genetically modified plants as research tools, for example to   understand how native plants and crops protect themselves against pests and   will react to climate change. “However, in most European countries permits to perform field experiments with   transgenic plants are blocked, not on scientific but on political grounds. “European authorities must ensure that approved and safe field experiments   with transgenic plants are made possible.”The signatories, which include world-leading plant scientists from the UK,   Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden, also   call for more effort in tackling ongoing vandalism and intimidation from   anti-GM activists. They reveal that 'some of us have even been threatened and had private   property vandalized'. “This is a serious threat to science, to publicly funded research, and to   European society itself,” they add.

telegraph,29/05/2013 07:15,news,"Genetically modified salmon can breed with wild trout to produce a new fast growing fish that can harm natural species, scientists have warned. The researchers fear that plans to farm a new type of GM salmon that grows   faster than normal salmon may result in some of the animals escaping into   streams and rivers. They conducted a study to examine the impacts that such an escape would have   on natural habitats. They found that the GM salmon, which have been developed by a Canada firm and   are expected to be given approval for sale as food in the US, could mate   with wild brown trout. This resulted in a “hybrid” species that grew faster than even the GM salmon.   They also “out competed” wild fish in laboratory based simulation of a   stream. Dr Krista Oke, who led the work at the department of biology at McGill   University in Quebec, Canada, said: “To the best of our knowledge, this is   the first study demonstrating transmission and ecological consequences from   interspecific hybridisation between a GM animal and a naturally hybridising   species. “Ultimately, hybridisation of transgenic fishes with closely related species   represents potential ecological risks for wild populations.” The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Proceedings   of The Royal Society B, warned that any attempts to farm GM salmon   should carefully assess the risks to the wider environment should they   escape. AquaBounty, a Canadian biotechnology firm, has spent 17 years developing a   type of Atlantic salmon that will reach full size in half the time of wild   salmon. The 'super-salmon' are grown in tanks and Panama and the firm has   applied to the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates food in the US,   to sell the GM fish in shops. The FDA recently ruled that meat from the fish was unlikely to pose a threat   to human health but it has still to give approval for it to be sold. The GM fish are unlikely to go on sale in the UK or Europe in the near future   as there are strict regulations on the use of GM meat for human consumption. However, environmental groups have expressed concerns that the fish could   escape into the wild and the Atlantic Salmon Federation has said they could   disrupt fish ecosystems. The latest research by Dr Oke and her colleagues seems to support their   arguments as the hybrid fish that formed when GM salmon mated with wild   trout led to other wild fish being far smaller than they would normally be. This is because they grew up to 80 per cent faster and ate much of the   available food. Dr Oke added: “Although transgenic hybrids would likely be rarer in the wild   than in our experiment, our results indicate that transgenic hybrids have a   competitive advantage over salmon in at least some semi-natural conditions. “If this advantage is maintained in the wild, transgenic hybrids could   detrimentally affect wild salmon populations.” Ron Stotish, chief executive of AquaBounty Technologies, described the   research as 'encouraging' and insisted would only market sterile female GM   salmon, known as AquAdvantage, so they could not breed.He added: 'Brown trout and Atlantic salmon are know to be able to produce   hybrid progeny.'This paper confirms that AquAdvantage, can be used to produce such hybrids,   and that the presence of the transgene does indeed confer accelerated growth   in hatchery conditions. “It is worth noting that in 1995, Peter Galbreath and Gary Thorgaard of   Washington State University published research that the Atlantic salmon   brown trout hybrid is sterile. 'If this holds true, such a hybrid would pose little ecological threat as the   fish would not reproduce.'"
telegraph,18/05/2008 10:36,news,"Gordon Brown today strongly defended the medical use of animal-human hybrid embryos, ahead of a key Commons vote on the issue. The Prime Minister said that stem cell research was an 'inherently moral   endeavour' and a 'profound opportunity' to save and transform   millions of lives. 'Britain is at the forefront of this research and responsible for much of   the worldwide progress,' he wrote in The Observer newspaper. The premier supports scientists who want to insert the nuclei of human cells   into animal eggs, creating hybrid embryos which are allowed to grow for a   few days. Stem cells can then be harvested and used to create brain, skin, heart and   other tissue for treating diseases - before the embryos are destroyed. MPs have a free vote this week on whether hybrid embryos should be legal as   part of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill. Mr Brown said he had 'deep respect' for those who disagree with the   bill because of religious conviction but added that 'we owe it to   ourselves and future generations' to back stem cell research. He said his government had sought to introduce 'clear laws'   permitting use of stem cells within a 'clear, managed, legal framework,   subject to the strictest supervision'. 'Let me be clear: if we want to sustain stem cell research and bring new   cures and treatments to millions of people, I believe admixed embryos are   necessary. 'The question for me is not whether they should exist, but how their use   should be controlled,' he added. 'The scientists I speak to are committed to what they see as an inherently   moral endeavour, that can save and improve the lives of thousands and over   time, millions.' Mr Brown's appeal has a personal dimension because his younger son, Fraser,   has cystic fibrosis - a condition that could benefit from embryo research. The bill will also see free votes on amendments to tighten abortion laws, by   reducing the upper limit from 24 weeks to 22 or even 20 weeks. Figures uncovered by the Telegraph show that almost 4,000 women have had at   least four abortions, including dozens who have undergone six by the age of   30. Dawn Primarolo, the Public Health Minister, accused some MPs of 'hijacking'   the bill to lower the abortion limit below 24 weeks. "
telegraph,27/10/2014 15:51,news,"Government-funded expert challenge the current position on genetic modification in light of advancing technology  Strict European controls on genetic modification should be swept away to open   the door to new crop improving technologies, Government-funded experts have   said. In a new position statement, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences   Research Council (BBRC) challenged the current precautionary approach that   has effectively stifled GM crop farming in the EU. The body, which allocates British government funding for biotech research,   highlighted the growing importance of ''genome editing'' technology that   allows precise and targeted genetic changes without having to switch DNA   between species. Such advances blurred the line between GM and non-GM breeding techniques, it   was claimed. This made fair assessments of GM applications difficult under the existing   regulatory framework, which focused on the methods used to produce a new   crop variety rather than a plant's actual characteristics. The EU approach to GM was in contrast to the process for approving new   medicines, which weighed up benefit and risk by looking at the active   molecules in a drug, not the way they were produced. The statement, from a panel of experts appointed by the BBSRC, says: ''Novel   genetic techniques have been developed in recent years and are advancing   rapidly. 'They include techniques commonly referred to as 'genome editing' that allow   targeted changes to be made to genomes, such as adding, removing or   replacing DNA at specified locations.''The new techniques offer the possibility of making genetic changes more   precisely than previously possible by targeting them to specific sites in   the genome. ''In some cases it will be impossible to tell what method was used to produce   a new crop variety, because exactly the same DNA changes could be introduced   using a variety of conventional breeding or newer techniques. 'The boundaries between established genetic modification (GM) and non-GM   techniques will become increasingly blurred as techniques develop. ''This raises questions about how new crop varieties should be regulated. A   regulatory system based on the characteristics of a novel crop, by whatever   method it has been produced, would provide more effective and robust   regulation than current EU processes, which consider new crop varieties   differently depending on the method used to generate them.'' BBSRC chief executive Professor Jackie Hunter said: ''With its excellent plant   science research, the UK is well placed to lead the world in crop   improvement and to facilitate the step-change in agricultural productivity   that will be required to feed the world sustainably. 'There is no doubt that improved crop varieties will be produced using   these new methods around the world and commercialised in countries outside   of the EU. 'If we want the UK and the EU to continue to be world-leading in this   area, we must ensure there is appropriate regulation in this changing   landscape.'' Professor Ottoline Leyser, from Cambridge University, who chaired the expert   panel, said: ''This is an exciting time for plant science with rapid   advances in our understanding of gene function and in the technologies   available to use this understanding for crop improvement. 'These developments present a number of important questions about how the   benefits from these new techniques can best be realised, requiring active   engagement of a wide range of stakeholders.'' Currently the insect-resistant maize MON 810, made by the agrochemical company   Monsanto, is the only GMO cultivated commercially in the EU. "
telegraph,6/11/2011 9:15,news,"Grains of rice have been genetically modified by scientists so they produce a key component of human blood in an attempt to provide an alternative to donations. The protein, extracted from rice plants containing human genes, could be used   in hospitals to treat burns victims and help patients who have suffered   severe blood loss.The scientists behind the research claim it will provide a plentiful and safe   alternative to products from human blood donations, which are in short   supply due to falling numbers of donors, and get around the need to screen   for diseases such as HIV and hepatitis. Currently in the UK around 1.6 million pints of blood are needed every year   but just four per cent of the eligible population donate. Donated blood is separated into three components - red blood cells, platlets,   which are used to aid blood clotting, and plasma, which is mainly made up of   a protein called Human Serum Albumin and is given to patients suffering   heavy blood loss.By growing the genetically modified rice in fields, the researchers claim   Human Serum Albumin could be mass produced for use in hospitals, reducing   the need to purify it from blood donations. Human Serum Albumin is the most abundant protein in human blood and performs   important functions including carrying hormones and minerals around the   body, mopping up harmful toxins from the blood stream and helping to   regulate blood pressure.Dr Daichang Yang, the scientist who led the research at Wuhan University in   central China, said: 'Human Serum Albumin is an important protein. The   demand for it is estimated at more than 500 tons per year worldwide. 'Currently commercial production of HSA is primarily based on collected   human plasma, which is limited in supply, but of high clinical demand. 'There is also an increasing public health concern with plasma derived HSA   with its potential risk for transmission of blood-derived infectious   pathogens such as hepatitis and HIV.'The use of a rice seed bioreactor could provide an economical and safe   approach for the production of non-animal derived compounds.'Dr Yang and his colleagues have developed a technique for inserting human   genes into Asian rice using bacteria, turning the plants into biological 'factories'   that can produce proteins that are identical to those found in humans.Their latest research, published in the scientific journal of the Proceedings   of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that they had successfully   inserted DNA for Human Serum Albumin and the resulting protein was   chemically and physically identical to that found in blood.Over successive generations they were able to increase the amount of Human   Serum Albumin produced in the rice grains until it accounted for 10 per cent   of the soluble protein produced in the rice seeds.It comes just months after Chinese scientists announced they had genetically   modified a herd of around 300 diary cows to produce milk with the same   qualities as human breast milk, which sparked widespread concerns among   animal welfare campaigners.The latest work to introduce human genes into rice is likely to inflame   opposition to GM technology further amid fears over the safety of   genetically modified crops and alarm at combining human genes with those   from other species.Dr Yang said, however, that the protein produced by the genetically modified   rice was identical to Human Serum Albumin found naturally in blood. Tests on   rats also showed it did not produce any adverse reactions.They also treated rats suffering from cirrhosis with the protein and showed it   was effective at relieving the symptoms, much like the naturally occurring   protein found in human blood.Dr Yang is also hoping to use genetically modified rice plants to produce   other proteins found in human blood, including haemoglobin, which gives   blood its distinctive red colour and is carries oxygen around the body, and   key proteins from the immune system such as immunoglobulin.A patent application  by Dr Yang and his colleagues revealed they hope to   adapt the technique to produce a wide range of human proteins that can be   used in medical treatments.The team are also working on a strain of genetically modified rice that   produces proteins that are similar to insulin for use in treating diabetes.Gavin Murphy, a consultant in cardiac surgery at Bristol Royal Infirmary and a   senior lecturer at the University of Bristol who studies the impact of blood   transfusions on patients, described said the research had the potential to   revolutionise the supply of blood products for use in hospital.He said: 'This is ground breaking stuff, but so far they have only   validated it in rats. The real test will be to show it is safe in humans,   can be purified and sterilised effectively.'With this approach they will be able to grow these plants in fields and   produce blood proteins on a huge scale that would really solve all of the   supply issues we currently face.'"
telegraph,5/5/2005 0:01,news,"Human eggs have been grown in a laboratory from ovarian stem cells for the first time, a step which could make it possible to delay the natural menopause, scientists said yesterday.          Pre-menopausal ovaries could be revitalised by colonising them with younger stem cells, potentially delaying the menopause by 10 to 12 years.          The breakthrough raises the prospect of extending a woman's child-bearing years and could yield new strategies for egg preservation and fertility treatment.          Young cancer patients who have not yet reached puberty and have had treatment that stops them producing eggs later in life, could have ovarian tissue preserved for later use.          Research published in the journal Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology suggests that limitless supplies of eggs could be grown from cells scraped off the surface of ovaries.          A woman's ovaries contain about two million egg-producing follicles at birth. By the time she reaches puberty, this number has fallen to about 400,000 and it continues to drop until, at the menopause, too few remain to allow her to become pregnant.          The new research confirms it is possible for ovarian stem cells to give rise to new eggs. However, some experts warned that what could be done in a laboratory could not necessarily be reproduced in the body.          Scientists from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, took surface cells from the ovaries of five women aged 39 to 52. The cells were grown in the laboratory for five to six days, either with or without exposure to phenol red, a growth-stimulating oestrogen medium.          Cells cultured without the growth medium grew into immature, small cells of various types, while those grown with phenol red changed directly into large, egg-like cells. They went on to become mature human eggs capable of being fertilised and developing into an embryo.           A spokesman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said: 'This research suggests that cells can be taken from human ovaries and used to grow mature human eggs that are capable of being fertilised and becoming an embryo.          'This would mean female cancer patients who have to undergo chemotherapy can have their ovarian tissue harvested and frozen for this future purpose rather than having to go through the process of eggs being harvested and frozen.'           Stem cells taken from newly formed embryos are in theory capable of becoming any kind of cell in the body.          Jonathan Tilly, associate professor of obstetrics, gynaecology and reproductive biology at the Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts, said: 'The concept is intriguing and warrants more study and investigation, and should it play out, it is a huge breakthrough.          'However, making things in a dish is very different to making things in a human body. There have been reports from three groups using embryonic stem cells in mice to create sperm and eggs, but not one of these groups has been able to create offspring, suggesting that whatever is being created in the dish is not normal sperm and eggs.'"
telegraph,19/02/2008 21:30,news,"Human trials are about to start of a form of gene therapy that shows great promise in treating one of the worst kinds of cancer.          Glioblastoma multiforme is one of the most common and most aggressive of the 100 or so types of brain cancers. The resulting tumours are a surgeon's nightmare, being irregularly shaped, with poorly defined borders. They spread easily and kill between six months and year of diagnosis, given that neither surgery, radiotherapy or drugs can halt the disease.          Now a study in laboratory rats, conducted at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre, Los Angeles, supports a plan to launch a Phase 1 human trial of the gene therapy later this year on 20 patients.          The approach that attracts and 'trains' immune system cells to destroy deadly brain cancer cells also provides long-term immunity, produces no significant adverse effects and - in the process of destroying the tumour - promotes the return of normal brain function and behaviour, reports the team in the journal Molecular Therapy.          'These findings appear to be a significant milestone in creating an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme,' said Dr Maria Castro, co-director of the Board of Governors Gene Therapeutic Research Institute and principal investigator.         'This therapy significantly improved survival rate, induced long-lasting systemic anti-tumour immunity, and resolved the neuropathological abnormalities caused by the tumours, which has been a stumbling block to many promising treatments.'         Patients often suffer behavioural abnormalities that affect concentration, memory and balance because, as the tumours grow, they displace and compress nerves and their connections. But the rat experiment found that long-term survivors who had received the gene therapy did not have long-term injury or impairment of behaviour.          'Tumour growth causes behavioural deficits, but even treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can cause learning disabilities and other cognitive problems.         'In our animal study, this therapy eliminated the tumour mass and reversed the deficits that were caused by the tumour,' said Dr Pedro Lowenstein, co-author and Principal Investigator in the Phase 1 clinical trial.          The researchers used a virus stripped of its disease-causing genes as a vehicle to deliver two proteins directly into the tumour cells. One protein attracts immune cells, called dendritic cells, into the brain, which is usually beyond the reach of the immune system because of the so called 'blood brain barrier'.          Another protein acts like a trojan horse - herpes simplex virus type 1 thimidine kinase (HSV1-TK), once in the tumour cells, and combined with an antiviral drug given to the patient, it becomes toxic. When used together in rats with glioma, the survival rate jumped to about 70 per cent.          'In the fairly near future, this combined gene therapy may work synergistically with current therapies, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, allowing doctors to reduce dosages and avoid side effects,' Dr. Castro said.         'With the safety, effectiveness and curative potential seen in these studies, we are hopeful that gene therapy for GBM could become the new standard of care.'          However, commentators caution that many other studies have produced promising findings in animal experiments that have not yet been successfully translated to patients."
telegraph,8/3/2012 6:30,news,"Humans are a lot closer to gorillas than appearances would suggest, scientists have found.A study has shown that across 15% of their genetic code, or genome, gorillas   are more like humans than chimpanzees. In both, certain genes have also evolved at the same rate, research shows.   They include genes for hearing, throwing into doubt theories linking the   development of hearing and human language. The findings emerge from the first completed genome sequence, or genetic 'blueprint',   of the gorilla. Gorillas are the last of the living great apes to have their genetic codes   mapped, allowing scientists to compare the genomes of humans, chimpanzees,   gorillas and orang-utans. The new research was chiefly based on DNA taken from Kamilah, a female western   lowland gorilla. Scientists at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire,   searched more than 11,000 genes in the gorilla, human and chimpanzee looking   for important evolutionary differences. In all three species, genes related to sensory perception, hearing and brain   development showed accelerated evolution. But this was especially true for   humans and gorillas. Dr Chris Tyler-Smith, senior author of the research published in the journal   Nature, said: 'Our most significant findings reveal not only   differences between the species reflecting millions of years of evolutionary   divergence, but also similarities in parallel changes over time since their   common ancestor. 'We found that gorillas share many parallel genetic changes with humans   including the evolution of our hearing. 'Scientists had suggested that the rapid evolution of human hearing genes   was linked to the evolution of language. 'Our results cast doubt on this, as hearing genes have evolved in   gorillas at a similar rate to those in humans.' Gorillas separated from humans and chimpanzees on the evolutionary path around   10 million years ago, the research showed. A more gradual divergence between eastern and western gorillas occurred much   more recently in the last million years or so. This could be compared with the split between modern humans and Neanderthals,   or chimpanzees and bonobos, said the scientists. Co-author Dr Aylwyn Scally, also from the Sanger Institute, said: 'The   gorilla genome is important because it sheds light on the time when our   ancestors diverged from our closest evolutionary cousins. 'It also lets us explore the similarities and differences between our   genes and those of gorilla, the largest living primate. 'Using DNA from Kamilah, a female western lowland gorilla, we assembled a   gorilla genome sequence and compared it with the genomes of the other great   apes. 'We also sampled DNA sequences from other gorillas in order to explore   genetic differences between gorilla species.' "

The gene therapy, although imperfect, offers a dramatic improvement of night and day vision.         The therapy aims to insert normal versions of a gene patients lack, called RPE65, to restore a cycle of enzymes which regenerates vitamin A molecules essential for converting light into nerve signals in the retina at the back of the eye.         Dr Cideciyan, Prof Samuel Jacobson and colleagues injected the treatment into one eye of three young adults with the condition. By 30 days after treatment, all three patients, 2 male and 1 female, showed significant improvement in the sensitivity of the retina, the light sensing layer, in their treated eye.         The researchers, who report their results in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that gene therapy could increase sensitivity in daylight by up to 50-fold, and in dim light by up to 63,000-fold.         'Earlier reports from the trials showed safety of the intervention and modest improvement of vision,' said Dr Cideciyan. 'The current report from our trial shows dramatic improvement of both day and night vision corresponding to the area that was treated in all three participants.'         There are two components to vision loss in this disease. Although the degeneration of cells in the retina remained the same after treatment, they found 'gene therapy could completely reverse the component caused by the missing RPE65 enzyme.'         A team led by Prof Robin Ali at University College of London Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital, did the world's first gene transplant for blindness and believe the method could be ready for use within two years to treat people suffering from some inherited diseases of the retina, which affect 20,000 people in Britain.          The method could be used on people who suffer age related macular degeneration, AMD, a common condition that affects 500,000 Britons. 'I think there will be a trial for AMD perhaps within three years,' he said.         Prof Ali said that the new study marked 'an elegant paper that provides careful analysis of the effects of gene therapy.         Prof Sam Jacobson - the senior clinician is someone I have the highest regard for. It gives us a much better indication of optimal dose and provides huge encouragement for the whole field.          We can now begin to find out how much useful vision is restored by improving retinal sensitivity and whether the results are better in young children when we treat the whole retina using a high dose.'"
telegraph,30/05/2000 00:00,comment,"IT is a bit like the dawn of the Millennium last January - an anti-climax. We are now living through one of the most momentous events in human history and it just does not feel like it.As you read this, scientists are completing the transcription of the 'rough draft' of the human genome, which represents the first time in four billion years that a species has read its own recipe. Meanwhile, newspapers are full of a story about one girl's A-levels.I do not mean to cast aspersions on reporters. Science reporters have done a good job of covering the race to read the human genome - Roger Highfield's interview today with Professor Allan Bradley on page four being a prime example. They have been helped by the contrast, not to say clash, between the personalities of those involved: the swashbuckling privateer, Craig Venter, and the self-effacing boffin, John Sulston. Without that, it would be hard to sell the story to editors at all.Let us face it: the completion of the human genome does not make a natural news story. It is either too predictable, because we know the scientists are inching towards completion; they have practically announced the date on which they will announce the news. Or it is too mysterious, because not even the scientists know what they have found.They are now saying that there may be 40,000 separate human genes, not the 80,000 that has been the commonest estimate. If they do not even know how many there are to within a factor of two, how can they pretend to know their significance? The completion of the genome is not a scientific ending; it is a beginning.This lack of newsworthiness is a problem. It is not until years later that the significance of a discovery is realised or changes the way we think about the world. In 1858, the president of the Linnean Society lamented that the year 'had not been marked by any of those striking discoveries which at once revolutionise, so to speak, our department of science'. That was the year when Darwin announced his theory - at the Linnean Society.So here are some of the headlines you did not see. 'Pole says Earth goes round Sun'; 'Heretic drops cannon ball off leaning tower - nobody hurt'; 'Man hit on head by apple'; 'Bearded recluse argues grandmother was ape'; 'Monk grows dwarf pea'; 'Patent clerk has weird thought on tram'; 'German professor finds cat dead in box'. (* Names below.)Even when there was an attempt at coverage of scientific breakthroughs, they are beyond parody. The New York Times covered the discovery of the double helix thus (and three months late): 'Form of life unit in cell is scanned - Sir Lawrence Bragg reports gain in study of structures of nucleic acid molecules'. Talk about burying the lead.So we shall have to wait many years to know just how momentous is the completion of the human genome next month. Is it, as I have argued, the greatest intellectual moment in human history? Or is it the beginning of realising that genes are over-rated?In Newcastle, last weekend, Carol Vorderman opened Life Interactive World, an extravanganza devoted largely to sharing the excitement of modern life science - and the agony of debate - with the public. As its chairman, I am biased, but when we planned it four years ago, we argued to the Millennium Commission that genetics and biotechnology would be hot topics by the first years of the Millennium. In that, at least, we feel vindicated. Time will tell if the public shares the excitement, but the queues yesterday were encouraging.Not that our opening was much of a news story, either - except locally. This newspaper and the Financial Times honourably excepted, the national papers and news bulletins resolutely ignored it, preferring to bang on ad nauseam about the Dome. I am beginning to wonder if journalists get nosebleeds when they travel north of Watford.    Answers: Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Mendel, Einstein, Schrodinger.   "

Listening at a conference in November to Jan Leschly, one of the architects of the world's biggest pharmaceuticals merger, they were shocked out of their complacency when he denounced the drug discovery industry as a 'bad investment'.                               Blue sky projects: GlaxoSmithKline's pharmaceuticals R&D facility in Harlow          Surely not, they must have thought. Why had Leschly spent so much time and effort putting together such a research powerhouse as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) if he really thought it was not worth doing? They could comfort themselves with the thought that he was stepping down as the merger finally took place, and that he is now a venture capitalist, but his statistics do not make comfortable reading.He pointed out that in the last 15 years the entire industry had brought a mere 137 products to market. Over the same period some 1,900 products failed their clinical trials, despite the billions poured into their development.You do not need to be a drugs expert, or even a delegate to a pharmaceuticals conference, to know that the path from inventing a compound to selling a drug is long and risky. Yet surely, we are constantly being told, the next generation of drugs will come from big companies. They alone have the resources to harness the advances in genetics which will allow 'designer' cures for today's intractable diseases.Well, perhaps, if the world really has changed. If the past is a better guide, big drugs companies are grossly inefficient spenders of research money. This realisation has propelled Shire Pharmaceuticals into the FTSE 100. Shire believes that that 'big pharma' should concentrate on late-stage research only - which is akin to nurturing saplings rather than planting acorns.The company has no facilities for non-clinical development, and will only work on drugs that are already being tested in humans. 'The other stuff is real blue sky,' says chief executive Rolf Stahel. 'In the mid to long term, fewer and fewer pharmaceutical companies will perform actual discovery research functions. They will increasingly be spun off into self-standing institutions.'Stahel believes that large companies are not suited to early stage research. 'The bureaucracy of big companies is not good for creating ideas,' he says. 'This very creative work is better done in a smaller environment.' Andrew Wood, finance director at genomics company Oxford Biomedica, agrees. 'There is wonderful technology, and very able scientists in big pharmaceutical companies,' he says. 'However, small, agile and narrowly focused companies are often able to come up with something novel.'There are signs that big pharma is getting the message. GSK's investors hope that the cash flow from existing drugs will be spent on buying new ones or signing partnership deals, rather than trying to develop them from scratch.It is not hard to see why. Both Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham had a bad Millennium year. The biggest story was Lotronex, the irritable bowel syndrome drug which was withdrawn by the American drug regulators because of concerns over its safety. Then there was antibiotic Factive, which received a non-approval letter from the same regulators.Romozin, a promising diabetes drug, was delayed by at least a year, flu drug Relenza had a disappointing launch, a heart drug was abandoned, a medicine for smoker's cough delayed. Neither company has any drug in late-stage development that could be described as a potential 'blockbuster', defined as one with a sales potential of over £600m a year. Rivals such as Pfizer are increasingly concentrating on deals with small biotechnology companies.Dr Sally Bennett, pharmaceuticals analyst at ING Barings, believes that the consolidating industry will increasingly rely on collaboration and co-promotion with the biotechnology sector. 'The way I see it, there is going to be more consolidation,' she says. 'We will end up with five or six really large pharmaceutical companies that are basically marketing machines.' With so many of the real breakthroughs being made in tiny biotechnology companies and university laboratories, perhaps it is just as well.'GSK's new chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier has put a team together to seek inlicensing opportunities for drugs. One suggested acquisition is a rheumatoid arthritis treatment owned by Celltech, which is a minnow by comparison.So what has the colossus done wrong? Some industry specialists criticise both Glaxo and SmithKline for being distracted by the excitements of early stage genomics, neglecting sales and marketing. 'The companies have been seduced by novelty,' said one. 'They need to get back to a commercially pragmatic model. After all, many successful drugs are 'me-toos', rather than new concepts.'If early-stage drug discovery is better done by tiny biotechnology companies, or even university labs, should large pharmaceutical companies move out of it altogether? John Patterson, executive vice-president of product development at AstraZeneca, says not. 'We have never thought of moving out of it,' he says. 'The quality of earnings you get from discovering drugs, you simply cannot get by inlicensing. Besides, it is our raison d'être to discover new medicines.'Yet even with this purist approach, Astra is hunting for early-stage medicines to plump up its portfolio. Patterson says that gaps in the drug pipelines are an occupational hazard, and that inlicensing drugs is not an admission of defeat. 'We try to develop a portfolio that meets the long and short-term needs of the business, but it's sometimes hard to control. Discovering drugs is a bit like waiting for a bus. You wait and wait and then three come along together.'Despite this claim, Astra spends much more money on branding its drugs than it does on research and development, with between 17pc and 18pc of sales going on research and 25pc to 30pc on marketing. This is common throughout the industry, where selling to GPs and specialists has become as important as discovering new compounds. For instance, SmithKline managed to turn its anti-depressant, Paxil, into a blockbuster through aggressive marketing, despite its similarity to Prozac.So are pharmaceuticals companies about to shift their altruistic images and become brand-pushers like Unilever, but selling ulcer cream instead of Ben & Jerry's ice-cream? Stahel, at Shire, says it will never happen. 'Even when you inlicense a drug for clinical trials, it is still a very long process of drug development,' he says. 'You are only abandoning the first two years.'Nine out of 10 drugs fail in clinical trials, so the risk portfolio is still pretty high. Large pharmaceutical companies can take that risk, but their scattergun approach to research and development does little to reduce it. Concentrating on sales and marketing rather than early stage research might be less romantic, but it seems to be more cost-effective.glaxosmithklineshire pharmaceuticals groupastrazeneca"
telegraph,21/02/2012 07:07,foodanddrink,"Laboratory-grown meat is just the latest sci-fi food to fly in the face of public taste. It’s a tale straight from the pages of the weirder realms of science fiction.   A mysterious millionaire and a brilliant professor join forces, with a   single aim. To create Frankenburger: the world’s first test-tube beefburger. Peculiar as it may sound, it’s the future for our food, according to the   academic in question, Professor Mark Post of Maastricht University in the   Netherlands. He plans to serve up the first burger this October after   growing beef muscle in his lab, which will eventually become a juicy   quarterpounder. Post has grown small strips of beef muscle tissue using a   cow’s stem calls and serum taken from a horse foetus (are you hungry yet?).   Just like all growing muscles, they are currently flexing away in order to   become bigger and healthier – only, in true sci-fi style, they are doing so   in a Dutch lab, held in place by Velcro and stimulated by electricity. When   fully grown, 3,000 of these muscles will be needed for one burger – and will   cost an estimated £200,000.Professor Post has big plans for his stem-cell-cum-foetus version of fast   food. “Eventually my vision is that you have a limited herd of donor animals   in the world that you keep in stock and that you get your cells from,” he   says. So who’s the chef who will cook up this scientific experiment and launch a   culinary revolution? You guessed it – Heston Blumenthal. And the lucky   diner? To be confirmed, says Professor Post. “My financier will decide who   will eat it... [he is] famous, everyone knows this guy.” But we will not   learn his identity, not at least until his Frankenburger has proved a   success. Ketchup anyone?Let’s be serious. We shouldn’t undermine credible efforts to solve the crisis   in the world’s food supply. But rarely do the inventors of these   technologies seem to understand why consumers are sceptical of their ideas   and motives. There are dozens of examples of food technology “big talk” that   has come to nought. Scientists and biotech companies grumble that their   efforts fail because of bad press – yet it is often entirely their own fault   that the public are so suspicious. To begin with, they tend to make our stomachs churn. In-vitro meat production   uses stem-cell technology and fetal material. How will we feel, eating the   product of an animal that, never mind being kept in a factory farm, was   never allowed life at all? Technologies such as this unnerve us because they   interfere with the magnificently sedate process of evolution. We like to   think what we eat is unaltered and as natural as possible. I’ve always thought it was astonishing that we subject our food to far fewer   safety checks than we do our medicines. After all, we can eat the same foods   every day for a lifetime, making them more risky. Medicines are (hopefully)   only consumed for short periods of time. Genetically modified foods, for   example, are not as thoroughly investigated as GM drugs. Cancer therapies   using genetically modified organisms are rigorously tested over many years,   yet pesticide-resistant wheat or soya needs only to be tested for three   months – and tested on rats, not humans. The use of stem cells to cure human   diseases is being debated all over the world by philosophers and   politicians. Why is it being cleared for use on our plates with such ease?The technology is expensive, but Post hopes that expanding his operation will   make it affordable. The reality is, though, that efforts of scientists to   feed the world sustainably rarely see the light of day. Twenty years ago,   biotechnologists created super-nutritious GM “Golden Rice,” transforming   rice with genes from a daffodil to add nutritious beta carotene. It was   hoped it would reduce Vitamin A deficiency in developing countries. But the   project has encountered many technological difficulties, while attracting   fierce opposition from pressure groups. Supporters of in-vitro meat say that it will solve many problems – not just   hunger. Like what I wonder? In-vitro meat won’t prevent greenhouse-gas   emissions from livestock farms because dairy farms are a major source of   methane, and milk cannot be made in a laboratory (yet). And while less land   will be used for livestock, I can’t see that there is a great need for it   for other uses. We won’t need, presumably, as much grain for animal food (a   test tube does not need feeding). And we certainly don’t need more potatoes   or onions, cauliflowers or carrots – Spain, Holland and Africa can grow all   the other vegetables we want so cheaply. What to do with the prairies of   England? I predict the tumbleweed will be blowing across uninhabited plains   in no time. Heston Blumenthal will surely employ all his powers to get the Frankenburger   to taste decent. He is no shirker when it comes to using gadgets to enhance   his cooking. It will probably need colour added to the flesh – Professor   Post admits that the muscle strips are currently “pinkish towards yellowish”   – and the flavour of well hung beef needs replicating. But hey, a little   hydrolysed vegetable protein, an unpleasant soya-based additive most often   used in stock cubes to make them taste meaty, should do the trick.It’s not that I’m against growing protein, per se. Let’s not forget Quorn, a   vegetarian mycoprotein developed in Buckinghamshire using a soil fungus.   Grown in tanks in oxygenated water, it develops from a single spore to a   mass that can then be processed, given texture and sold as a meat   alternative. It is not a mushroom, and it certainly does not taste like   fungi, or anything else much. But it has made a lot of vegetarians happy and   is a thousand times less controversial than using genetically modified   organisms and stem cell science in food technology. Think back to the origins of the “food without fields” fantasy. NASA,   contemplating putting astronauts in space for long periods, initiated the   in-vitro meat project nearly 20 years ago. They hoped that one day, those   sent to space could feed themselves from on-board “farms”, which grew beef,   pork, lamb and salmon. That, too, sounds like another great sci-fi story. But could it provide a clue to the provenance and funding for Frankenburgers?   Consider the three elements of this story: space travel, mystery wealthy   investor and great publicity stunt. It feels very Richard Branson (who’s set   to send tourists to space some time in 2013) to me. If so, Sir Richard, let   me whisper a little something in your ear. Please don’t call it Virgin Beef."

The move came after a High Court ruling that cloning was not, as ministers thought, banned or regulated by law.Now a Bill with the aim of making human reproductive cloning a specific criminal offence will be introduced in the House of Lords, Alan Milburn, the Health Secretary, announced yesterday.It follows the High Court ruling on Thursday that upheld the ProLife Alliance claim that human embryos created by cell nuclear replacement - the Dolly cloning method - fell outside the protection of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.The ruling meant, in effect, that the cloning of human beings was no longer illegal. The Government will appeal against the decision. Stem cell and other research using embryos created by fertilisation will continue to be allowed and regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.Regulations introduced in January which amended the 1990 HFE Act to allow stem cell research on embryos to cure serious diseases and other conditions are not affected by the High Court ruling, the Government added.No licence applications have been made to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority for stem cell research using embryos created by the cloning technique which was the subject of the judicial review.Controversial fertility expert Dr Severino Antinori has said he wants to come to Britain to clone human babies as a result of the ruling.

telegraph,21/01/2008 22:00,news,"Millions could benefit from the discovery of a gene therapy that can deliver the pain relief benefits of morphine-like drugs without the side effects of abuse and addiction.                                                      Pain discovery may lead to new drug                                              Vast numbers of people world-wide suffer with chronic pain, as a result of injury or arthritis, which affects every aspect of their lives, and often results in depression          Now a method to use gene therapy - a gene transplant - to simulate the pain relief effects of morphine and other opiate drugs has been developed by a team in the Department of Medicine and Department of Neurosciences at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York.          Today, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers suggest that gene therapy for pain might in the future become a treatment alternative for patients with severe chronic pain.          'Chronic pain patients often do not experience satisfactory pain relief from available treatments due to poor efficacy or intolerable side effects like extreme sleepiness, mental clouding, and hallucinations,' says Prof Andreas Beutler, principal scientist.          His team designed a virus that could carry a pain relief gene called prepro-beta-endorphin into nerve cells. The gene makes an opioid that the body itself produces and that acts like morphine.          The modified viruses were tested by injecting them directly into the spinal fluid of rats via a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, with only one injection. Results showed that the rats remained symptom-free for over three months.          Another pain relief gene, interleukin-10, was also effective when similarly administered in small doses directly at the spine.          'One of the strengths of our gene therapy work is, that it was effective with an opioid gene and with a non-opioid gene,' says Prof Beutler. 'Both approaches have important implications.'          The prepro-b-endorphin gene codes for a natural pain relief chemical that works in a well established way. 'Opioids are unequivocally effective in humans, for example, morphine and oxycodone are among the most active analgesics (though they often cause intolerable side effects),' he says.         'Thus, it is highly unlikely that the opioid-gene based approach in our paper would be limited to rodents. Importantly, our treatment selectively targets nerve cells along the spinal cord, thereby directing activity to the 'pain gate' and sparing the brain and peripheral organs, where opioids often cause severe side-effects (like extreme tiredness, mental clouding, hallucinations).'          The non-opioid approach is equally important, he says. 'Interleukin-10 is an entirely new player in the pain field. At this time, it is completely speculative whether interleukin-10 targeted to the spinal cord can be effective in humans.          'Testing spinal interleukin-10 for chronic pain in humans is very difficult because it is not available as a drug and because it would be very difficult to infuse interleukin-10 for a prolonged period of time at the spinal level because of the risks associated with long-term spinal catheters.         'In this situation, gene therapy as described in our article might serve as an important bridge of bringing a new treatment principle from the bench to the bedside.'          'Based on our findings, this targeted gene therapy via lumbar puncture appears to be a promising candidate for bench-to-bedside research that might ultimately be tested in patients with intractable chronic pain, for example, to help patients suffering from severe pain due to advanced cancer.'         'Regarding the time frame, when this could go into a first clinical trial in humans (that is, a phase I trial), 3-5 years would seem like a reasonable guess unless we  encounter major hurdles, which is always possible,' he says.          This comes only days after a team led by Prof Hanns Ulrich Zeilhofer at the University of Zurich identified a pain relief target, which is found in a part of the grey matter of the spinal cord, called the dorsal horn, where signals from pain nerves are relayed to the brain.         Prof Beutler comments: 'I find their work extremely elegant and cutting edge and that I think that it has an excellent chance of leading to new treatment paradigms in the real world. Equally importantly, their work contributes very substantially to our understanding of pain mechanisms.'"
telegraph,22/10/2010 09:57,comment,"More borrowing and spending will not solve the problem.SIR – This week, David Cameron accused Labour of having no plan for economic   recovery. This is not entirely fair. In reality the Opposition has two plans: the Darling/David Miliband plan,   which is basically the same as the Government’s, but to be implemented over   a longer time; and the Brown/Balls plan, which advocates more borrowing and   spending.The difficulty for the Opposition is that Ed Miliband favours the Brown plan,   not least because it is not supported by his brother, while the shadow   chancellor, in that he understands either plan, favours the Darling one.Unfortunately, as Labour has neither a moral nor an economic compass, it would   not be able to navigate the country out of the present crisis with or   without a plan.Richard CoulsonMaidstone, KentSIR – The Government seeks to reduce the prison population by 3,000 as part of   its cost-saving programme. Whether it will achieve any cost saving is open   to doubt, as I argued in my recent report for Civitas think tank. Moreover,   the extent to which sentencing practice must change to achieve this goal   should not be overlooked.For a reduction of 3,000 in the prisoner population, some 26,000 people   currently sentenced to three months would have to receive a community   penalty instead. This takes no account of reconviction among those sentenced to less than 12   months’ custody (currently responsible for some 120,000 proven offences   within 12 months of release, and many more undetected), nor of the removal   of any marginal deterrent effect of custody.We can look forward to an increase in cases where the police take no further   action, to the Crown Prosecution Service discontinuing more cases, and, all   in all, an increasing divergence between the bark and the bite of criminal   justice.Ken PeaseManchester Business SchoolManchesterSIR – I believe the Government made the right decision in not cutting the   international aid budget. The spending review was full of tough decisions,   some of which are really going to hurt my friends. But we made a promise to   the world’s poorest people about aid, and I’m proud that we are honouring   that promise. It’s the just and right thing to do.Annette WicksLondon SE5SIR – In the interests of the nation the referendum on the alternative vote   system should be scrapped, saving £70 million.Simon LewisBraintree, EssexSIR – If the deficit is cleared by the end of the current parliament and the   economy recovers, what will the Government do with the billions of pounds it   will receive from privatising its bank shares?Hugh PayneHitchin, HertfordshireNaive to rely on FranceSIR – With their emasculation of the British Armed Forces, David Cameron and   George Osborne have completed the task begun by Napoleon 200 years ago. The   assertion that we can turn to France for help in times of threat shows how   naive these two are. The French have an unwavering, and perfectly reasonable, record of only ever   acting in the interests of their own country. They have never come to the   aid of Britain, unless you count the adventures of William the Conqueror.The claim by this unworldly pair that their decision was forced upon them by   the financial crisis rings hollow when set against the plan to increase   overseas aid and provide a new multi-billion pound budget to educate   two-year-old children.Commander Anthony Holt (rtd)DorchesterSIR – Fifty years ago this week, my father (Bill Bedford) made the first   tethered hover of the Hawker P1127, the prototype Harrier. In early 1963, he   made the first vertical landing on an aircraft carrier, aboard HMS Ark   Royal. The Harrier entered service with the Fleet Air Arm, a combination that proved   its worth in the Falklands conflict in 1982 and remains as strong as ever to   this day. He would be astonished now to see the planned destruction of naval aviation,   with the present Ark Royal and Harrier fleet being thrown on to the scrap   heap. He would also turn in his grave at the thought of future carriers having no   fixed-wing aircraft until at least 2020, and the lack of any planned   capability for vertical or short take-off and landing, which means great   loss of flexibility and severely reduced ability to project air power.Group Captain Peter Bedford RAF (rtd)Esher, SurreySIR – Is it coincidental that the carrier likely to be put into “extended   readiness” is named HMS Prince of Wales?Dr Alan B. ThomasGreat Sankey, CheshireBrown’s empty seatSIR – Did Gordon Brown’s absence from the House for the Chancellor’s statement   constitute contempt or cowardice?David Hutchinson Nutley, East Sussex SIR – At least Tony Blair had the decency to resign his seat once he no longer   intended to occupy it.Dr Jeremy StockerWilloughby, Warwickshire The EU and sovereigntySIR – John Glanville (Letters, October 16) is right to ask how European powers   can be repatriated to Westminster. It is not too late. Everything depends   upon principle, political will and the national interest. The European Parliament proposals for increasing the EU budget are not yet   concluded, but the issue goes beyond this. Parliamentary sovereignty is not   theoretical – it is practical. It affects every part of the daily lives of   voters.The Conservative Party manifesto promised, in line with the principle of my   Sovereignty Bill, to deal with this. The Coalition Government is now   introducing a sovereignty clause, as yet unseen, in a European Union Bill   next month.Parliamentary sovereignty means that Parliament, on behalf of voters, can   legislate as it wills, and did so at the time of passing the European   Communities Act 1972. This was a “voluntary Act”, as Law Lords have clearly   stated – and subject to parliamentary sovereignty.However, it is not enough to reaffirm parliamentary sovereignty, and merely to   do so would open the door to judicial interpretation. Already there are   attempts (in line with assertions of the European Court of Justice) to claim   that European law has superiority over our constitution and therefore   Westminster. Declaration 17 of the Lisbon Treaty (crucially, later in time   than the Metric Martyrs case) asserts European case law to this effect. This   is unacceptable.The late Lord Bingham in The Rule of Law (2010) made clear the importance of   maintaining parliamentary sovereignty in line with proper constitutional   doctrine. Any sovereignty clause must require the judiciary to give effect   to this. It must be a clearly expressed Westminster enactment, even if   inconsistent with European law, including the ECA 1972. This is the   constitutional route to repatriation.The European Scrutiny Committee, of which I have been elected chairman, is to   take evidence when the Government’s clauses are published – including   evidence from the Minister for Europe.Bill Cash MP (Con)Chairman, European Scrutiny CommitteeLondon SW1Adult stem cellsSIR – We are told that a trial of embryonic stem cells marks “the dawn of the   'stem cell age’?” (Health, October 19). In fact, the sun came up some time   ago, thanks to stem cells taken from adults, not embryos.Embryonic stem cells have yet to result in a single treatment. Adult stem   cells have already produced over 70. Adult stem cells require no destruction   of the human embryo, or what the Nobel prize-winning Robert Edwards   accurately described as a “microscopic human being”.Professor John KeownKennedy Institute of EthicsGeorgetown UniversityWashington, DC, United StatesDownton dramsSIR – If we are to be picky about scenes in Downton Abbey, in 1912 no   gentleman would take ice with his whisky and water.J. LivingstoneNether Heyford, NorthamptonshireIn your dreamsSIR – Frederick Thornley (Letters, October 21) is not alone in finding it hard   to read in dreams. I dreamt that I caught a very large fish (thus making up   for real life). When I tried to weigh it I found, to my intense frustration,   that I could not read the numbers on the dial of the scales.Dr Gregory ChapmanRadcliffe-on-Trent, NottinghamshireMotives for defection from the Church of EnglandSIR – The reason some Anglicans are moving to the Catholic or Orthodox   churches has not so much to do with the proposed consecration of women   bishops but with Tereska Lynam’s statement (Letters, October 18) that the   Church of England is a Protestant faith. Sadly, those who hold to the catechism description of the Church of England as   Catholic and Reformed increasingly have to look elsewhere.Malcolm RobertsonMansfield, NottinghamshireSIR – There was an exodus of both priests and laity in 1992 after the Synod’s   decision to ordain women (Letters, October 21). At that time, the Act of Synod came into being, meaning that parishes could   opt out of having a woman preside at their altar or be their incumbent. We   also had our own bishops, the Provincial Episcopal Visitors or “flying   bishops” as they became known. Last July, the General Synod broke its promise that we would be given   concessions “in perpetuity”. The Pope’s very generous offer last October is a lifeline, and many of us will   be looking to follow where St Peter’s in Folkestone has led.Yvonne SilverExmouth, DevonSIR – If God could speak through the prophetess Deborah (Judges 4:4-7), then   that is good enough for me. Therefore, as an Anglican, I have no problem   with women priests and bishops.Perhaps the time has come for Rowan Williams to make an offer to those Roman   Catholics who have a problem with papal infallibility to join the Anglican   Church. David BrownBristolSIR – Your writers and correspondents have only considered the Anglican side   of the question. I am sure I am not the only Catholic who does not welcome a   mass influx of misogynists – we have more than enough already.Kathleen AgunloyeNewport, Shropshire"
telegraph,20/03/2003 00:01,education,"Natural factors that can turn skin cells into follicles have been discovered by scientists, offering new hope for both hairy women and the millions of men who suffer from baldness.The delicate interplay of two chemical signals, proteins called Wnt and Noggin, has been found to coax parent cells, called stem cells, to develop into hair follicles rather than skin cells.The proteins change a stem cell's shape so that it can separate from adjoining cells and move downward - an essential step for the formation of hair follicles.Prof Elaine Fuchs and colleagues from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Rockefeller University report the discovery of the natural skin factors today in Nature.'Manipulation of these natural factors may in the future be valuable in either stimulating the onset of hair growth or in preventing the formation of unwanted hair,' she said.Skin contains an enormous reservoir of stem cells. This enables skin to renew every two weeks or so but also offers opportunities to divert some stem cells to create follicles instead.'We are trying to answer the question of whether we can coax some 'skin' stem cells to become hair,' said Prof Fuchs. 'Drugs to activate these natural factors could promote hair follicle growth.'Equally, by finding drugs that can halt the signals, it may be possible to get rid of embarrassing hair.The latest research could also be relevant to treating some cancers, such as colon and breast tumours, because the process that leads to the separation of a stem cell from other cells may be the same as the one that allows a cancer cell to spread from its host tumour to invade a body."

The European Parliament approved a deal on Tuesday which will let countries   decide for themselves whether they want to plant GM crops. British scientists are firmly behind genetic modification believing that it   could help farmers produce plants which are healthier and need fewer   pesticides. The new legislation, which will be in place by Spring, could mean that   commercial GM crops including maize and oil seed rape are grown in Britain   from this year.In the short-term the crops are unlikely end up on our tables. They will be   sold for animal feed, and so enter food chain indirectly. However it opens   the door for genetically modified fruit and vegetables to be sold in British   supermarkets. However a poll by YouGov last year found that 40 per cent of people believe   that the government should not be promoting the adoption of GM, while just   22 per cent believed that they should. And campaigners fear that disrupting the natural DNA of a plant could affect   biochemical pathways leading to the production of toxins which could be   harmful to health. Sally Beard, one of the founders of Mums Say No To GMOs said: “Families   throughout the country are not convinced by the assurances given by   ministers and pro-GM researchers that there are no risks to our health and   our environment. “We have seen evidence of risk and can’t understand why it is not being   investigated rigorously and why GM production is not halted in the meantime.”Friends of the Earth Senior food campaigner Clare Oxborrow added: “Successive   UK Governments have consistently championed GM crops and food - despite the   fact that this technology has been hugely over-hyped and delivered little.” Keith Taylor, Green MEP for South East England who voted against the new   proposals, added: “I remain convinced that GMOs cause contamination of   crops, are bad for our health and that small scale sustainable agriculture   is the answer to solving future food shortages.' Under the new rules each European country will be allowed to decide for itself   whether or not to grow GM, once it has been ruled safe by the European Food   Safety Authority (EFSA), the EU’s food safety body. The deal has been engineered by the British government who are fed up that GM   trials continue to be blocked by Germany, France and Italy. The ruling was welcomed by the science community who said that countries who   refused to move towards genetically modified crops would become stuck ‘in   the Dark Ages of science.’Professor Nigel Brown, President, Society for General Microbiology said: “GM   crops will help feed a growing population and require fewer herbicides and   pesticides. I would have thought that was a desirable outcome.'Crops are currently being trialled at Rothamsted Research, Hertfordshire and   Norwich in Norfolk, but they will not be sold commercially. Wales and   Scotland are opposed to the use genetically modified crops and have already   said that they will not be growing them.Genetically modified crops are plants where the DNA has been modified to   introduce a new trait such as the ability to withstand drought or insects.   Scientists 'cut and paste' a gene from another organism with these   capabilities and insert it into the genome of the plant. They are already widely used in the US, Canada, Brazil, Argentina and India.   Around 85 per cent of all corn crops in the US are now GM. GM ingredients are already in food available on supermarket shelves, mostly in   cooking oils containing GM soy or oilseed rape. However these will be   labelled, according to EU law. Most supermarkets have banned GM ingredients   in their own-brand products. "
telegraph,25/07/2006 00:01,news,"New restrictions that would prevent European Union funding being used to extract stem cells from surplus human embryos were criticised yesterday by the Royal Society, the UK's academy of sciences.          The EU yesterday agreed to continue funding controversial medical research using human embryonic stem cells, which are thought to have the potential to help treat a wide range of diseases, after a coalition of countries led by Germany failed to block money for new experiments.          A deal was reached after a carefully-worded commitment by the European Commission not to directly fund projects for which human embryos would be killed. But science ministers confirmed that money would still be available for experiments that used existing lines of embryonic stem cells.          'We are glad that the European Council of Ministers has been able to reach an agreement by a 'qualified majority' on the EU research budget,' said a Royal Society spokesman.          'However, it does appear that the council has agreed that EU funding can be used for studies on human embryonic stem cells as long as this research does not itself involve the destruction of human embryos.           'It remains to be seen what impact these limitations will have on research given that they impose greater restrictions than currently exist for EU research funding.'          A total of £37 billion is dedicated to the entire EU scientific research budget from 2007-2013.           But the principle of using the stem cells divided the 25 EU member states sharply on strict moral and ethical grounds. While the majority of the 25-nation bloc, including Britain, France and Spain, argued passionately in favour of the research, Germany along with a coalition of mainly Catholic countries argued vehemently against.

dailymail,16/02/2015 18:13,sciencetech,"Penguins lost three of the five basic vertebrate tastes—sweet, bitter and the savoury, meaty taste known as umami—more than 20 million years ago and never regained them, researchers have found.They believe climate change could be to blame.Researchers say the genes were lost after cold Antarctic temperatures interfered with taste perception.University of Michigan researchers say they are surprised by the discovery Because penguins are fish eaters, the loss of the umami taste is especially perplexing, said study leader Jianzhi 'George' Zhang, a professor in the U-M Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.'Penguins eat fish, so you would guess that they need the umami receptor genes, but for some reason they don't have them,' he said. 'These findings are surprising and puzzling, and we do not have a good explanation for them. 'But we have a few ideas.'Zhang suspects the sensory changes are tied to ancient climate-cooling events in Antarctica, where penguins originated. His leading hypothesis is that the genes were lost after cold Antarctic temperatures interfered with taste perception, in a paper in the journal Current Biology. The first author, Huabin Zhao, was a U-M postdoctoral researcher under Zhang when most of the study was conducted.Vertebrates typically possess five basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami. Over the past 15 years, remarkable progress in understanding the molecular basis of taste has opened the door to inferring taste abilities from genetic data through the examination of taste receptor genes.Compared with mammals, birds are thought to be poor tasters, due in part to the observations that they have fewer taste buds on their tongues and lack teeth for chewing food. Previous genetic studies showed that the sweet taste receptor gene is absent from the genomes of all birds examined to date.Zhang said the penguin study was prompted by an email from colleagues at BGI, a genomics institute in China. Researchers there had sequenced genomes from Adelie and emperor penguins and could not find some of the taste genes. They wanted Zhang to help determine whether the absent genes were the result of incomplete sequencing or a true evolutionary deletion.Zhang and his colleagues took a closer look at the Adelie and emperor data. In addition, they analyzed bird tissue samples (chinstrap, rockhopper and king penguins, plus eight other closely related non-penguin bird species) provided by the U-M Museum of Zoology.They also reviewed publicly available genomes for 14 other non-penguin bird species.They found that all five penguin species lack functional genes for the receptors of sweet, umami and bitter tastes. In the Adelie and emperor genomes, the umami and bitter taste receptor genes have become 'pseudogenes,' genetic sequences resembling a gene but lacking the ability to encode proteins. Pseudogenes often result from the accumulation of multiple mutations over time.The genomes of all non-penguin birds studied—including egrets, finches, flycatchers, parrots, macaws, falcons, chickens and mallards—contain the genes for the umami and bitter tastes but, as expected, lack receptors for the sweet taste. The researchers concluded that all penguins have lost three of the five vertebrate senses.'Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the umami and bitter tastes were lost in the common ancestor of all penguins, whereas the sweet taste was lost earlier,' the authors wrote.Penguins originated in Antarctica after their separation from tubenose seabirds around 60 million years ago, and the major penguin groups separated from one another about 23 million years ago.The taste loss likely occurred during that 37-million-year span, which included periods of dramatic climate cooling in Antarctica, Zhang said.  'This give us a hint, perhaps, that this loss of taste genes has something to do with the inability of this protein to work at lower temperatures,' said Zhang.Vertebrate tastes are mediated by taste receptors usually located in taste buds found on the upper surface of the tongue and elsewhere in the mouth. The human tongue has several thousand taste buds.A 1998 anatomical study of four penguin species found no taste buds in their tongues, strongly suggesting a reduction in taste function. The same study found that penguin tongues possess only a single type of lingual papillae, the raised protrusions that hold most of the taste buds in humans, which have four types of papillae.Penguin papillae are stiff, sharp and covered by a thick, horny layer, suggesting that penguin tongues are used primarily for catching and holding slippery fish or other prey. Those anatomical findings are in accord with the new genetic results showing a lack of receptors for three of the five vertebrate tastes in penguins. 'Their behavior of swallowing food whole, and their tongue structure and function, suggest that penguins need no taste perception, although it is unclear whether these traits are a cause or a consequence of their major taste loss,' he said.. "

The company was   started by Dr Husein Salem, who has worked at Manchester University and   Imperial College London on the development of cellular therapies for a   number of diseases. The use of stem cell medical treatment has become increasingly common and it   is now estimated that one in five people will use them to treat a condition   or for diagnostics.  The global stem cell market was worth nearly £2.5bn in 2012 and is expected to   grow to £3.87bn by 2016. PharmaCells’ patented technology allows stem cells to be collected from   adults’ blood to allow an individual’s own cells to be used in treatment. As   a result, the treatment is far more effective as it lowers the risk of a   body rejecting the cells.  PreciousCells expects the acquisition to boost revenues by £15m in three   years, with up to £3m in the first year. The deal is also creating 50 new jobs which will be divided between   laboratories in Glasgow and London. "
telegraph,16/08/2010 08:30,news,"Red blood cells have been created from spare IVF embryos cells for the first time in Britain, as part of a multi-million pound project to manufacture synthetic blood on an industrial-scale, scientists said. Researchers used more than a 100 spare embryos left over from treatment at   fertility clinics to establish several embryonic stem cell “lines”.One of those lines, known as RC-7, was transformed into blood stem cells   before they were converted into red cells containing haemoglobin, the   oxygen-carrying pigment.Scientists say the aim of the £3million research was to find cells genetically   programmed to develop into the O-negative blood group.This is the universal donor group whose blood can be transfused into anyone   without fear of tissue rejection, but is only found in seven per cent of the   population.Researchers also said the aim of the project, funded by the Wellcome Trust,   the charity, was to establish a manufacturing process to produce more than   two million pints a year.Experts said the research could soon revolutionise medicine by ending the need   to rely on volunteer donors to provide a constant source of blood for   lifesaving transfusions.The synthetic version would also be guaranteed free of infections, such as the   human form of 'mad cow' disease.It also raises the possibility of producing the entire supply of blood for the   UK from a single 'universal blood donor' who only ever existed as a   four-day-old IVF embryo.A key requirement for synthetic blood is for it to be cheaper than donated   blood to produce. At present it costs about £180 to make a pint of donated blood ready for   transfusion, but with extra costs for testing and donation it is closer to   £500 per pint.Blood supplies face a constant threat of shortages, with more than 2.5million   donations needed annually for transfusions and blood products.In order to achieve regulatory approval, the project has reportedly produced   four embryonic stem cell lines suitable enough for human clinical trials,   which scientists said conformed to the 'good manufacturing practice' (GMP)   grade.Prof Marc Turner, of Edinburgh University, who is also clinical director of   the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS), said synthetic   blood could transform medicine if made on industrial scale.It could overcome the problem of blood shortages while at the same time   reducing the risk of transmitting new infections between donors and   recipients. 'We've proved the principle that from these embryonic stem cell lines we can   generate red blood cells,' Prof Turner, who led the project, told The   Independent.'The regulators, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and   the European Medicines Agency, would need to be comfortable that the cells   were produced to sufficient quality and safety before they would allow the   first studies in humans.” “If we can crack it with red cells, it takes us a long way. It doesn't solve   it with other tissues but it takes us a long way to cracking it with other   tissues, such as liver and so on.'Jo Mountford, a stem cell scientist at Glasgow University, added: “We have   cells that are clearly red so we're happy with that. “We've managed to go 90 per cent down the path towards fully differentiated,   adult red blood cells.But some experts expressed concern when the trial was first reported last year.“Many good people who donate cord blood, adult blood or bone marrow, would not   wish to be in anyway associated with this proposed destructive use of   embryos, let alone research involving tissue from aborted babies,” said   Josephine Quintavalle, director of the Campaign for Reproductive Ethics.The first clinical trials of synthetic blood made from embryonic stem cells   could begin within five years.

Following the approval, ReNeuron will start the world's first trial of   injecting stem cells into patients' brains in the hope they will repair   areas damaged by stroke and improve both mental and physical function. The technology is controversial, in part because some stem cell lines are   derived from embryoes or foetuses, and the path to regulatory approval has   been rocky. ReNeuron was first granted permission to conduct the trial by the Medicines   and Healthcare Regulatory Agency last January, but needed a recommendation   from the GTAC before it could start the Phase 1 clinical trial. A year later, the company has been given the go-ahead and the first of twelve   stroke patients is expected to receive treatment in Scotland later this   year. Michael Hunt, ReNeuron chief executive, said the approval represented 'the   culmination of many months of work'. In anticipation of the announcement, analysts at Matrix last week upgraded   their target price to 26p from 14½p, saying that ReNeuron has 'made   its mark in history within the global stem cell field' and that the   trial marked a 'game-changing event'.

A judicial inquiry has been launched to find out how Rubis, a female lamb belonging to the French national institute for agricultural research (Inra) ended up on dinner plates.  Destined for animal research only, the lamb was sold to an abattoir in November 2014 along with unmodified sheep and then onto an unsuspecting customer, who has not been identified to date.  The sale and consumption of any genetically modified food products for humans is illegal in France.  Rubis was the fruit of Inra’s so-called “green sheep” programme launched in 2009 to produce lambs genetically modified to contain a green fluorescent protein originating from a jellyfish.  The proteins make the skin transparent and give off a greenish glow when exposed to certain ultraviolet light. Typically, they are used to monitor the activity of altered genes, and in this case to monitor transplants for heart disease.  .tg-pullquote__global__group{zoom: 1;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:before, .tg-pullquote__global__group:after{content: ''; display: table;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:after{clear: both;}.tg-pullquote__inline{float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content{margin: 0 20px 10px 0px; font-size:18px; line-height:23px; font-family:georgia; width:260px; float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content--mobile{float: none; font-size: 18px; margin-left: 4.687%; margin-right: 4.687%; width: 90.626%;}.tg-pullquote__title{font-family:arial; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px; border-top:1px dotted #000000;}.tg-pullquote__quote{color:#007A8F; font-style:italic; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__attribution{color:#787878; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__source{}.tg-pullquote__source__link{color:#234B7B; outline:0; text-decoration:none;}.tg-pullquote__source__link:hover{border-bottom: 1px dotted #122842; color: #122842;}.tg-pullquote__share{float:right;}.tg-pullquote__share--icon{background-image:url('http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.png'); background-image: url('http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.svg'), none; width:26px; height:26px;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink{border-bottom:none;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink:hover{border-bottom:none !important;}.tg-pullquote__share--twitter{margin-right:5px;}.tg-pullquote__share--facebook{background-position: 26px 0;}       'Normally the animals are euthanised and their carcasses incinerated'       (function(){var meta=document.getElementsByName('DCSext.Platform'); if( meta.length===0) return; if( meta[0].getAttribute('content') !=='mobile')return; var targets=document.querySelectorAll('.tg-pullquote__content'); var len=targets.length; while( len-- ){targets[ len].className +=' tg-pullquote__content--mobile';}})();document.getElementById('tg-pullquote143506303778888').innerHTML = '<div id='tg-pullquote__shareContainer' class='tg-pullquote__share tg-pullquote__global__group'><a class='tg-pullquote__inline tg-pullquote__shareLink' target='_blank' href='http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%20%22Normally%20the%20animals%20are%20euthanised%20and%20their%20carcasses%20incinerated%22&amp;url='+window.location.href+'?WT.mc_id=tmgoff_pq_tw_20150423'><div class='tg-pullquote__share--icon tg-pullquote__share--twitter'> </div></a><a class='tg-pullquote__inline tg-pullquote__shareLink' href='http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u='+window.location.href+'?WT.mc_id=tmgoff_pq_fb_20150423' target='_blank'><div class='tg-pullquote__share--icon tg-pullquote__share--facebook'> </div></a></div>'; The lamb belonged to the Inra’s animal research unit, UECA, which sells its unmodified animals to a local abattoir but has strictly no right to sell GM animals.

While Rubis was a class 1 GMO, in other words containing a gene posing 'no or negligible risk' to humans, Gérard Pascal, a former Inra biochemist, told Le Parisien its introduction into the human food chain was “intolerable”.  “Beyond the ethical issues, one cannot put foodstuffs into the market that haven’t been the subject of deep research.

The breakthrough paves the way for cartilage transplant operations for more than two million people who suffer the most severe form of the bone disease, osteoarthritis, which leaves them unable to walk and in constant pain.          Experts from the University of Bristol took just over a month to grow a half-inch piece of cartilage using stem cells, which are self-renewing and have the ability to grow into blood, bones or organs.          The cells were taken from the bone marrow of pensioners undergoing National Health Service replacement surgery due to the disease.          Crucially, the new technique is expected to overcome problems of transplant rejection because the patient's own cells would be used to create the cartilage. This would also avoid the ethical concerns over the use of human embryos in stem cell research. The most potent stem cells are found in human embryos, but a lesser supply can also be found in adult bone marrow.          Tests have shown that the laboratory-grown cartilage is of better quality than any previous attempts at tissue engineering. This means it should be 'springy' enough to work in a knee joint.          Transplant trials on NHS osteoarthritis patients are expected within two years, following the development by Prof Anthony Hollander and his team at Southmead Hospital in Bristol.

This is the first time that proper cartilage has been grown in a test tube.

Population changes suggest that these numbers will double over the next 20 years, presenting a huge challenge to the NHS as it tries to meet the booming demand for hip and knee replacements.          To grow cartilage, scientists took stem cells from bone marrow and placed them in a nutrient-rich solution, containing growth factors to help to boost cell development.

Researchers at the University of Southampton have discovered a reservoir of   stem cells in an area of the eye called the corneal limbus. And they have proven that, in the right environment, they can be transformed   into photo-receptor cells which react to light. Scientists are hopeful that implanting the cultured stem cells in a damaged   eye could reverse blindness. It could offer a potential cure for the hundreds of thousands of people   suffering macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa, which are both   caused by the loss of photo-receptor cells in the eye. And researchers were amazed to find that the cells even existed in the eyes of   a 97-year-old, opening up the possibility that the treatment could work for   the elderly. “These cells are readily accessible, and they have surprising plasticity,   which makes them an attractive cell resource for future therapies,” said   Professor Andrew Lotery, of the University of Southampton and a Consultant   Ophthalmologist at Southampton General Hospital led the study. “This would help avoid complications with rejection or contamination because   the cells taken from the eye would be returned to the same patient. “More research is now needed to develop this approach before these cells are   used in patients.” The loss of photoreceptors cells causes irreversible blindness. Age related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the   developed world which affects around one in three people in the UK by age   75. Around 513,000 people are in the late stage of AMD and that figure is set to   rise by one-third over the next decade, totalling nearly 700,000 cases by   2020. Almost two million people in the UK are living with sight loss, approximately   one person in 30. It is predicted that by 2020 the number of people with sight loss will rise to   over 2,250,000. By 2050, the number of people with sight loss in the UK will   double to nearly four million. There is currently no treatment for blindness caused by the loss of   photo-receptors. So far scientists have only shown that the concept works in the lab and are   yet to implant them in a human patient. But they are hopeful that the cells   could be taken from a patient, grown in the lab and transplanted back into   the eye. Clinical trials should begin within five years.Charities are optimistic that it could herald a brighter future for people   with sight loss. Clara Eaglen, RNIB Eye Health Campaigns Manager, said: 'At RNIB we talk   to people everyday who tell us about the huge impact that losing their sight   has on daily life, so this is very interesting research. 'The study shows that you can grow stem cells and make them act like   light sensitive cells, a big step forward in helping patients with   conditions such as age-related macular degeneration where damage has   occurred to the light sensitive cells. 'These cells can then be taken from a patient, changed, and replaced -   reducing the risk of rejection which is exciting. 'We are hopeful that stem cell technology will significantly change the   way in which people with sight loss are treated over the next decade.'The research was published in the journal PLOS One. "

A professor of microbial genomics at the University of Illinois, Yong-Su Jin, has found a way to change the way yeast reproduces. By altering its DNA, his team can increase the amount of nutritional components in the yeast while at the same time reducing the toxic byproducts that cause hangovers.  • Get drunk without a hangover on synthetic booze  Jin said: 'Fermented foods such as beer, wine and bread are made with polyploid strains of yeast, which means they contain multiple copies of genes in the genome. Until now, it's been very difficult to do genetic engineering in polyploid strains because if you altered a gene in one copy of the genome, an unaltered copy would correct the one that had been changed.'   Say goodbye to hangovers (ALAMY) He explained that the team were using an enzyme as a 'genome knife', which could be used to slice through all the copies of a gene, and stop automatic corrections happening.  • Wine overtakes beer as 'nation's favourite drink'  • Does white wine really send women loopy - or is it simply excess?  He added that the genome knife could be also used to clone the enzyme that enhances malolactic fermentation - a fermentation process that is important to the character and style of the wine - as 'improper malolactic fermentation generates the toxic byproducts that may cause hangover symptoms.'  Publishing their work in the Applied and Environmental Microbiology journal, Jin claimed the possibilities the genome knife produces are 'staggering' and that it could possibly even show how individual wines get their. unique flavours.  'Say we have a yeast that produces a wine with great flavour and we want to know why. We delete one gene, then another, until the distinctive flavour is gone, and we know we've isolated the gene responsible for that characteristic,' he explained.  The knife could also be used to introduce nutritional compounds into foods such as beef, cheese, kimchee, pickles and any other food that is produced by using a yeast fermentation method.  The research comes not long after a new drug called 'alcosynth' was invented that mimics alcohol whilst removing the risk of hangovers, liver toxicity, agression and loss of control. "
telegraph,14/04/2003 00:01,news,"Scientists have deduced the genetic sequence of the virus believed to cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in a move that paves the way for reliable tests for the illness and effective treatments.At about 4am on Saturday a research team in Canada completed the first publicly available draft sequence for the coronavirus - part of a family that includes forms of the common cold - that is the leading candidate for causing Sars.Thirty researchers at the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, part of the British Columbia Cancer Agency, had temporarily dropped their regular cancer work to get the results out as quickly as possible.Some got by with just two or three hours sleep and their workspace competed for space with pizza boxes and sugary snacks.A spokesman for the World Health Organisation called the achievement 'an extraordinary step' He added: 'Frankly, I thought that the CDC [the US Centres for Disease Control] would get it done first.'Sars is believed to have begun in the Far East and is blamed for more than 100 deaths worldwide.The genetic code of the virus is written in the ancestor of DNA, a genetic code called RNA, which also consists of a sequence of four genetic 'letters'. Reading the viral genetic sequence 'is a huge step forward in the fight to control the spread of Sars', said Dr Caroline Astell, projects leader at the Canadian centre.Her team began working around the clock to complete reading every genetic 'letter' of the sequence after receiving one millionth of a gram of purified genetic material belonging to the Sars coronavirus.The information, which has been posted on the Genome Sciences Centre's website (www.bcgsc.bc.ca), will lead to the development of definitive diagnostic tests for Sars, said Dr Marco Marra, the facility's director.At present, doctors worldwide diagnose Sars by a combination of unusual symptoms, including very high fever, difficulty breathing, a dry cough and contact with someone suspected of having the virus.In the longer term, sequencing the viral genome may allow scientists to understand why the Sars virus is so deadly, and may assist in the development of a vaccine.Many researchers think the virus, one of many that usually causes colds, may have mutated - perhaps as it moved from animals to people.Dr Steven Jones, head of bioinformatics at the Genome Sciences Centre, said: 'The next step for the Genome Sciences Centre is to analyse the proteins that the virus produces, to try to find clues for why this is such a virulent pathogen.'"
telegraph,1/9/2005 0:01,news,"Scientists have pieced together the genetic recipe of the chimpanzee, marking a milestone in the centuries-old quest to discover what sets humans apart from other animals.          Although humans did not evolve from chimps - they shared an apelike ancestor some six million years ago - they are our closest living relative.                                        Differences in the sequence of four chemical 'letters' that spell out the genetic codes, or genomes, of chimp (Pan troglodytes) and man (Homo sapiens) could account for the very human abilities to write opera, build cathedrals and walk on the Moon.          The comparisons of the two genomes, published today in the journal Nature by 67 researchers in the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, provide unambiguous confirmation of the common and recent evolutionary origin of humans and chimpanzees, as first predicted by Charles Darwin in 1871.          But they suggest that our species may be more different from the great apes than previously thought: the differences between the chimp and human genomes is 10 times greater than that which occurs between any two humans, but 10 times less than the differences between the mouse and rat.          Today's studies contain good news for men: contrary to some dire predictions made recently, the Y chromosome that distinguishes men from women is not heading for extinction, unlike the chimp Y which appears to be endangered by the ape's more promiscuous lifestyle, according to a report by Dr David Page, Dr Jennifer Hughes and colleagues at the Whitehead Institute, near Boston. Both male and female chimps engage with multiple partners when they mate, placing less pressure on evolution to preserve those genes on the Y whose functions have nothing to do with reproduction.          Because humans historically have been largely monogamous, our Y chromosomes have been spared.          To obtain the chimp genome, scientists analysed cells grown from Clint, at Emory University's Yerkes National Primate Research Centre. Clint spent his whole life at the facility and died last year of heart failure at 24.          A refined version of his genetic code is presented in the journal Nature by the consortium and, at first sight, it looks very similar to that of humans, consisting of about three billion or so genetic 'letters', with obvious differences in only 35 million, though some segments have been shuffled.          'Such a comparison will allow us to learn more about how our own genome has evolved and gain a better understanding as to why we get cancers and other diseases that chimpanzees very rarely suffer,' said Dr Richard Wilson of Washington University in St Louis. The latter include HIV and Alzheimer's.           'We still do not have in our hands the answer to a most fundamental question: What makes us human? But this genomic comparison dramatically narrows the search,' added Prof Robert Waterston, of the University of Washington, in Seattle. When the draft human genetic code was first unravelled a few years ago, scientists were surprised to find that humans were described by far fewer genes than expected, more like 25,000 rather than 100,000 as previously thought.           Today's findings show the genetic sequences of man and ape differ by only 1.2 per cent in terms of single-letter (base pair) changes to the genetic code, but duplications and rearrangements of larger stretches of DNA add a further difference of 2.7 per cent, report Dr Evan Eichler, of University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, and his colleagues.           'For all the talk of the 1.2 per cent single base-pair difference and the importance of those, there's even more difference between the species due to duplication events,' said Dr Eichler.          Hotspots of genetic creativity have been found by Dr Barbara Trask, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre and University of Washington, Seattle, and her team in regions near the ends of chromosomes, called subtelomeres, where DNA segments changed chromosomal location and copy number very recently and there are gross differences in gene content between human and chimpanzee, as well as between human individuals.          Genes usually code for proteins, the molecules that build and operate a body, and many key differences are expected to be found in genetic code that controls where proteins are made, how and in what quantities.           Now scientists are looking for changes that gave our ancestors a greatly enlarged brain, the ability to walk upright on two feet, and developed their complex language skills.                      rhighfield@telegraph.co.uk         "
telegraph,29/01/2014 14:40,news,"Scientists have turned adult cells back to their embryonic form in under 30 minutes by simply treating them with acid in a breakthough which could revolutionise personalised medicineThe era where organs and tissues can be re-grown is a step closer after   scientists found treating adult cells with acid takes them back to an   embryonic state in under 30 minutes.Experts in the field of stem cells have hailed the research as groundbreaking   and say, if replicated in humans, it would herald a new ‘age of personalised   medicine.’Turning cells back to an embryonic – also known as pluripotent – state means   they can then be turned into any other type of cell in the body.Previously that could only be achieved through genetic manipulation which was   time consuming and costly.But scientists at the Riken Centre for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan,   found that cells taken from newborn mice effectively ‘lose their identity’   within 30 minutes of being exposed to mildly acidic conditions.Professor Austin Smith of Cambridge University, writing in the Journal Nature   said the new cells could be seen as a ‘blank slate’ from which any cell   could emerge depending on its environment. “Remarkably, instead of triggering cell death or tumour growth as might be   expected, a new cell state emerges that exhibits and unprecedented potential   for differentiation into every possible cell type,” he said. The discovery has been hailed as ‘incredible’ by scientists who believe it   will speed up the advancement of personalised medicine. Stem cells offer the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells   and tissues to treat diseases including Alzheimer's, spinal cord injury,   stroke, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. They could be used to regenerate organs, stimulate the growth of new blood   vessels, or create skin grafts. “(This) approach in the mouse is the most simple, lowest cost and quickest   method to generate pluripotent cells from mature cells,” said Professor   Chris Mason, Chair of Regenerative Medicine Bioprocessing, at University   College London.“If it works in man, this could be the game changer that ultimately makes a   wide range of cell therapies available using the patient’s own cells as   starting material – the age of personalised medicine would have finally   arrived. “Who would have thought that to reprogram adult cells to an embryonic stem   cell-like (pluripotent) state just required a small amount of acid for less   than half an hour – an incredible discovery.”Professor Mason said the development was likely to speed up the development of   technology in everyday clinical practice although warned that was still   years away. Dr Dusko Ilic, Reader in Stem Cell Science, Kings College London, said the   findings were ‘revolutionary.’“The papers describe a major scientific discovery and they will be opening a   new era in stem cell biology,” said Dr llic.“Whether human cells would respond in a similar way to comparable   environmental clues, it stills remains to be shown. I am sure that the group   is working on this and I would not be surprised if they succeed even within   this calendar year. “The approach is indeed revolutionary.  It will make fundamental change in a   way how scientists perceive the interplay of environment and genome.” Prof Fiona Watt, Director of the Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative   Medicine, Kings College London, also said it was a ‘remarkable finding.’ The studies were published in the Journal Nature."
telegraph,11/7/2006 0:01,news,"Scientists have turned stem cells from an embryo into sperm that are capable of producing offspring, it was announced yesterday.          The advance in reproductive science raises new opportunities to treat male infertility and the possibility that women could make sperm.          The professor behind the research believes that, when safe, the advance could help men with certain types of infertility to become fertile, to remain fertile for longer and, controversially, could even one day enable a lesbian couple to have children that, at the genetic level, are truly their own.          The experiment used embryo cells to produce seven baby mice, six of which lived to adulthood, though the survivors suffered problems of the kind also seen with cloning.          A team led by Prof Karim Nayernia isolated embryonic stem cells from a blastocyst, an embryo only a few days old that consists of a cluster of cells. These cells were grown in the laboratory and screened to sort out the spermatogonial stem cells, which were genetically marked, grown and then injected into female mouse eggs and grown into early-stage embryos.          After transplant into female mice, seven babies resulted. Six developed into adult mice, though the animals were either too small or too large, and they died prematurely.          The advance, reported yesterday in the journal Developmental Cell, helps scientists understand more about how animals produce sperm, creates more opportunities to carry out genetic alteration of animals, and shows that cells may one day be coaxed in the laboratory to make sperm to treat infertility.          In the long term, cloning methods could be used to turn a skin cell from a man into sperm and Prof Nayernia said it was even possible that it could be achieved using a cell from a woman.          Prof Nayernia, Professor of Stem Cell Biology at Newcastle University, said: 'This research is particularly important in helping us to understand more about spermatogenesis, the biological process in which sperm is produced. We must know this if we are to get to the root of infertility.          'If we know more about how spermatogonial stem cells turn into sperm cells, this knowledge could be translated into treatments for men whose sperm is dysfunctional, although this is several years down the line.          'For example, we could isolate a patient's spermatogonial cells, encourage them in the laboratory into becoming functional sperm and transplant them back into the patient.'          Harry Moore, Professor of Reproductive Biology, University of Sheffield, said: 'This latest finding is exciting, as it is the first indication that germ cells [immature sperm cells] produced in this way have the full potential to create an individual. This opens up many important possibilities for research related to genetics, cancer and cell reprogramming.'          It could shed light on how abnormal development of germ cells in men may lead to testicular cancer and infertility but he added: 'The latest findings also highlight that these processes in the test tube are far from perfect as the mice that were born by this process were abnormal.          'We therefore have to be very cautious about using such techniques in therapies to treat men or women who are infertile due to a lack of germ stem cells until all safety aspects are resolved. This may take many years.'"
telegraph,12/1/2007 0:01,news,"Scientists will be allowed to make a case for the creation of human-animal embryos to seek treatments for nervous system disorders it was announced yesterday.          The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) said it would launch a scientific and public consultation on the contentious issue.          Two teams of British scientists have applied for licences to create 'hybrid' embryos that would be about 99.9 per cent human and 0.1 per cent animal to produce embryonic stem cells — the body's building blocks that can grow into all other types of cells.          They want to use stem cells to understand and develop therapies for diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cystic fibrosis, motor neurone disease and Huntington's.          The hybrid embryos would be destroyed within 14 days when they were no bigger than a pinhead.          Researchers were relieved at the announcement of the consultation because they had been privately told to expect the HFEA was likely to formulate a policy that would ban the work. Decisions on their applications are now on hold.          At a meeting on Wednesday, the HFEA board decided the applications do fall within its remit and there was no legislation that forbids it.          The committee said neither politicians nor public have fully understood the complexities of the different types of proposed research.          It is to invite evidence in a public consultation this summer, before presenting the findings in the autumn.          Angela McNab, the HFEA chief executive, said: 'The issues around hybrid and chimera research are unique and different from mainstream human embryo research. 'The authority felt it would be wrong to make an immediate judgment on these complex and controversial matters before we have built up a proper body of evidence.          'We need to work closely with the scientific community, the various interest groups and the public to develop a proper understanding of the different types of science that hybrid and chimera research would involve. We can then decide the appropriate approach.'          The Government has sent out confusing signals on the issue. In December, a White Paper included a proposed ban on the creation of embryos that are part-human, part-animal, with a provision to allow such research in certain conditions under licence.          Tony Blair said last week that although there were difficult issues the Government was 'not dead set against' the creation of early hybrid embryos for research.          A draft Bill for legislation to replace the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 is being prepared with the intention of including a full Bill in the Queen's speech next November.          Dr Stephen Minger, who leads one of the British teams, said the consultation would, 'provide the scientific community the opportunity to inform the public and government of the merit of this research'.          But Josephine Quintavalle, of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: 'This kind of research is unnecessary. It is high time the authority defers entirely to Parliament and allows MPs to decide. It is not their function to write our legislation or interpret our laws.'"
telegraph,23/01/2005 00:01,finance,"Sir Christopher Evans, Britain's leading biotechnology entrepreneur and the chairman of Merlin Biosciences, the venture capital group, is spearheading the plans to set up a public-private foundation to fund research into the area.           He has joined forces with Lord Winston, the fertility expert, Sir Richard Sykes, the rector of Imperial College and former chairman of GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceuticals group, and Jon Moulton of Alchemy Partners. Sir Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin, is also in talks to become a trustee.           Evans, who is understood to have met Tony Blair to discuss the proposal last week, believes that Britain is in danger of ceding its world leadership in the contentious field.          Stem cells are 'parent' cells of all the different types of cells in the body and scientists believe they may one day be able to replace damaged cells and rebuild tissues, helping people suffering from degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.           Until now, Britain has led the way, thanks to regulations allowing, after careful scrutiny, the creation of cloned human embryos for the production of stem cells for therapeutic purposes. It is, however, highly controversial and pro-life campaigners fear the science could make it easier to clone babies, which is outlawed. In the US, the Bush administration is against human embryonic stem-cell research.          But a lack of funding in the UK has meant that British stem-cell companies and scientists have been forced to look to other countries to help finance the next stage of their work. Even in the US, several states are launching multi-billion dollar initiatives to fund research into stem cells.          'There is a plan to set up a UK stem cell foundation to encourage and support research into stem cells,' said Sykes. 'The plan is to set up the foundation, get a big chunk of money from the Government and then match that with private money. We started off at the forefront of this science but are now going backwards: nothing is progressing very fast.'          Moulton, one of the City's most influential venture capitalists, confirmed that he had pledged 'a noticeable amount' of his own money towards the fund.           'It's a purely charitable activity. There will be tremendous scientific activity in this area. We started out in front and there is a danger now that the UK could fall behind.           'There is plenty to do here. I understand that Chris met with Blair last week, who indicated he was very supportive of the idea.'

telegraph,8/6/2014 6:00,finance,"Stem cell storer Smart Cells is growing overseas but struggling with attitudes in the NHSOnce discarded as medical waste, the blood left in the umbilical cord after a   baby’s delivery is now considered a rich source of stem cells similar to   those in bone marrow, and can be used to treat childhood diseases such as   leukaemia and cerebral palsy. Smart Cells, a British company that has been collecting and storing such cells   since 2000, has seen demand for its service grow in Mediterranean countries   such as Spain, Portugal and Greece, and in the affluent Middle Eastern   market of Dubai. But parents in Britain have been slower to see its   benefits. “Despite high levels of education and affluence, it has not been widely   adopted in northern Europe, including Scandinavia, the Netherlands and the   UK,” says Shamshad Ahmed, founder of Smart Cells. “We’ve seen steady growth   over the past decade [5pc a year] outside Britain. “The uptake is highest in countries which have a larger private medical care   sector, where people are used to paying for medical care and in those   Mediterranean countries where the culture towards children is more intense,”   he said. The other barrier to growth in Britain is the NHS, according to Ahmed, who   formed the company, based in West London, with his wife, Fehmina. “The NHS   is just not supportive of private companies,” he says. The company which has an annual turnover of £4m, pulls in 32pc of its revenue   from the domestic market, 30pc from southern Europe, 28pc from the Middle   East and Gulf and 10pc from Hong Kong. As most NHS hospitals will not allow midwives to collect cord blood on the   request of the parents, Smart Cells sends a phlebotomist to the labour ward   to drain tissue after the baby is born, as the placenta comes away, and a   courier then transports it back to the Smart Cells laboratory, via a   temperature-controlled kit, where it is then frozen for up to 25 years. The   process costs £2,500 per child. “When we first started there was a lot of controversy surrounding stem cell   storage — people felt it was a waste of time and we were scaremongering —   but 30,000 transplants have now been completed worldwide,” he says.Stored stem cells have been used in transplants to treat more than 70   different diseases including lymphoma, sickle-cell disease, and some   metabolic disorders. Unlike marrow, which is obtained through a painful   medical procedure and replenished by the body, this method of collection is   simple and not directly from the child. But access to this service can come down to one individual — despite the   mother’s wishes. “Most of the reasons why we are not allowed to collect full   stop is based on the views of the head of department. For example at   Princess Alexandra the head of midwifery was against cord blood collectiond   via a private company, she moved to Queens Hospital in Romford and changed   their policy too.”“In certain hospitals, there is a stem cell collection procedure and public   bank for ill children — but this doesn’t give the parents the choice to   store for their own family. “In many cases such as leukaemia the stem cells of one healthy child can help   save the life of his or her sibling.” The health alert last week over babies   who were poisoned in neonatal care units via nutritional drips, used to feed   premature newborns, could also trigger a concern around external services   and procurement. The contaminated batch killed one baby in London’s St   Thomas’s.“In this case there was no liability on the part of the hospital and such a   situation could have regretfully also occurred with something like outside   catering,” said Ahmed. “But given the way the NHS do behave and at times get   into panic, it may have a further impact on other companies being allowed   in.”Smart Cells, which once stored blood for Darcey Bussell, the ballerina and   Strictly Come Dancing judge, encountererd its fair share of setbacks with   the global economic downturn.The science was popular in southern Europe   until the eurozone crisis put in a dent in demand for its service. The rise of the internet also bred more competition, with a series of   digital-only services springing up. “A handful of cowboy outfits sprang up   but have fallen by the wayside,” said Ahmed. And of course reputable   organisations have set up in competition as well, such as Virgin’s Health   Bank. While Smart Cells has collected from 70 different countries, breaking the UK   will rely on referrals from parent to parent, said Fehmina Ahmed. “We need   people to understand the positives,” she says, “and spread the word.”"
telegraph,23/10/2007 00:01,news,"Superbugs such as MRSA pose a far greater threat to humanity than bioterrorism, a genetics pioneer claimed.                                       The warning came from Craig Venter, an American scientist currently working on a project which uses DNA building blocks to create the world's first synthetic life form.             Critics argue that artificially-created microbes – bacteria which can cause disease – potentially pose a grave danger, by either invading the environment or being used to manufacture deadly bioweapons.             But Dr Venter maintains that drug-resistant bacteria such as MRSA are a far more clear and present danger, and argues that his work could provide the only effective way of stopping the superbugs.         Dr Venter pointed out that antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, such as MRSA, were killing more people in the US than tuberculosis.         A strain of the bug had now appeared that could not be treated by any known type of antibiotic.         'I'm much more concerned about that than any threat of bioterrorism,' he told journalists at the Science Media Centre in London yesterday.         'The US government is doing very little about it and I'm not aware of the British government doing anything substantial about it.         'Drug-resistant Staphylococcus is the equivalent of a new biological infection.'         Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have already succeeded in transplanting the complete genetic code from one microbial organism to another and 'booting it up' like new software in a computer.         The next step is to build from scratch an artificial genome – a complete set of genes in a cell or organism. This goal might be only months away.         Dr Venter insisted that worries about synthetic organisms were unfounded. Much of the fear had been fuelled by Hollywood fantasies with no bearing in reality, he said.         'There's no Andromeda Strain,' he said, referring to a 1971 film in which a biotoxin destroys a town.         'There's nothing new or different about synthetic genomics other than the starting point for the information.'         In 1995 Dr Venter became the first scientist to work out the complete genetic code of an organism.         As president and founder of Celera Genomics, he was notorious for producing a private version of the human genome which offered information to scientists for a fee. In contrast, the rival Human Genome Project, a collaboration of scientists from all over the world, allowed completely free access to its data.         But Dr Venter, who is in the UK to promote his autobiography, said he had been wrongly portrayed as a capitalist exploiter of the genome.         He pointed out that without private money, he would have been forced to retire.         He added: 'If you look at the record, I have no human gene patents and my institution has no human gene patents, yet my biggest critics do.'"
telegraph,8/12/2005 0:01,news,"Tasha the boxer is about to help reveal why dogs have been man's trusted companions and hunting partners throughout recorded history.          Researchers have compiled the 12-year-old's DNA recipe, bringing scientists a step closer to finding the genetic causes of diseases common to all mammals and identifying the differences between dog breeds.                                        When combined with an earlier genetic sequence of a poodle called Shadow, Tasha will help reveal why some dog breeds are perfect for hugs, others make fierce guardians and a few look like fluffy toys.           Researchers have been keen to unravel the DNA code of dogs because, through selective breeding, they have the highest degree of physical and behavioural differences seen within a single species, from 6lb chihuahuas to 120lb great danes.           As a result, some breeds are predisposed to conditions such as heart disease, cancer, or blindness, and identifying genes responsible for diseases or traits should be much easier to do in dogs than man.          Today, an international consortium, including British teams from Oxford and Cambridge, and led by scientists from the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, unveils Tasha's DNA code in the journal Nature.          The sequence of 2.4 billion DNA 'letters' records the genetic recipe, or genome, of the domestic dog (Canis familiaris), which consists of 19,300 genes - roughly the same number as that found in people. The team also sampled the genetic recipes of 10 dog breeds, the grey wolf and the coyote, pinpointing 2.5 million differences in a single 'letter' of genetic code, which serve as signposts to physical and behavioural traits, as well as diseases.                                         'Of the more than 5,500 mammals living today, dogs are arguably the most remarkable,' said Prof Eric Lander, the report's senior author.           'The incredible physical and behavioural diversity of dogs - from chihuahuas to great danes - is encoded in their genomes. It can uniquely help us understand embryonic development, neurobiology, human disease and the basis of evolution.'           By tracking evolution's genetic footprints through the dog, human and mouse genomes, the scientists found that humans share more ancestral DNA with dogs than with mice, confirming that dog genes can be used to understand human disease. They also found that selective breeding has shuffled large blocks of DNA code among dog breeds, which should make it easier to find the genes responsible for body size, behaviour and disease.           'The genetic contributions to many common diseases appear to be easier to uncover in dogs,' said Dr Lindblad-Toh, the report's first author.           'If so, it is a significant step forward in understanding the roots of genetic disease in both dogs and humans.' The researchers compared Tasha's genetic code, which is around 99 per cent complete, with the 80 per cent complete code of the poodle Shadow.           It was the pet of Dr Craig Venter, who set up the Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR) in Rockville, Maryland, and led the private effort to record the human genetic code using his own DNA.           In the journal Genome Research, TIGR researchers tracked short interspersed elements (SINEs) - stretches of DNA that occur randomly in genomes and can act as signposts for disease. The scientists found that the poodle and boxer differed in 10,562 locations.           Broadening the study to nine other dog breeds and five genomes of four types of wolves and a coyote, the scientists estimated that the dog population contains 20,000 SINE differences.                      rhighfield@telegraph.co.uk         "
telegraph,2/5/2003 0:01,news,"The ability to make an endless supply of human eggs for post-menopausal women - even for men - could emerge from a breakthrough in reproductive science published today.Scientists have found a way to mass produce eggs from embryos, even male embryos, a technique that could scrap the 'biological clock' of women, end the shortage of eggs for infertility treatments and remove one of the reasons given by maverick doctors for cloning babies.However, the American research also makes it feasible for men to make eggs too so that it will be possible, in theory, for a homosexual male couple to have children that are genetically their own, with the help of a surrogate mother.Although it seems likely a similar approach could also help infertile men to make sperm, the technique will not enable women to make sperm because they lack a Y chromosome, the 'maleness' chromosome (men do have one X chromosome, the sex chromosome possessed by women, so they can make eggs).One professor of theology called the work 'a cannon ball fired across the bow of Christian bioethics. Many still operate with the assumption that babies require a mummy and a daddy.'Prof Ian Wilmut, of the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, is excited by the implications for cloning because it undermines claims that it could be justified for infertility treatments.'If the method can be adapted for use with human embryo stem cells, and to produce sperm from embryonic stem cells, this would be the end to calls that cloning should be used to overcome infertility,' he said yesterday.Instead, cloning would be used to create an embryo from an infertile person and then an egg or sperm as required, which in turn could be used for IVF treatments.'In this way, both man and woman would contribute their genes to the child as they do normally,' he said. The possibilities are raised today by Prof Hans Scholer's team at the University of Philadelphia which removed cells from early male and female mouse embryos, placed those stem cells in Petri dishes and grew them into eggs and then into embryos.Reported in the journal Science, the work shows that, even outside the body, embryonic stem cells remain 'totipotent,' that is capable of generating any of the body's tissues, said Prof Scholer.'Most scientists have thought it impossible to grow gametes (egg and sperm cells) from stem cells outside the body since earlier efforts have yielded only somatic (body) cells.'But his team found that not only can stem cells from mouse embryos produce eggs but also those eggs can then divide, recruit adjacent cells to form structures similar to the sacs - follicles - that surround and nurture natural mouse eggs and develop into embryos.The American team now plans to test whether those eggs can be fertilised."
telegraph,12/10/2002 0:01,news,"The creator of Dolly the cloned sheep is to make the first application to clone human embryos in Britain.Prof Ian Wilmut, leader of the team at the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, produced Dolly, the world's first mammal cloned from an adult cell, and made headlines worldwide when he announced details of the feat in 1997.Now he wants to apply his cloning expertise to research on human embryonic stem cells, parent cells that can turn into any kind of tissue.Nerve cells grown from stem cells could be used for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, islet cells for type I diabetics, and cardiac cells could be used to repair an ailing heart.To date, stem cell research has been conducted in Britain on surplus embryos from fertility treatments. Now Prof Wilmut plans to use the same method he used to create Dolly, called nuclear transfer, to clone early human embryos that are genetically identical to cells taken from an adult.The human eggs required to create the clones would be obtained from women undergoing reproductive tract surgery. Donors would not be compensated.Dr Harry Griffin, of the Roslin Institute, confirmed yesterday that the application to clone human embryos was being prepared.'We will have to create a very strong case and that case is being constructed and will be put through our own internal ethics committee,' said Dr Griffin.Prof Wilmut has always said he has no intention of cloning babies by implanting the cloned embryos into a surrogate mother, which is banned in any event, because he believes it is unethical and unsafe.His first goal is to create stem cell lines that could help understand complex conditions such as heart disease. Another idea is to use them to test how a person would respond to drugs, said Prof Wilmut.'Based on stem cells from a variety of donors, we can investigate possible differences in the metabolism of an active ingredient and thus predict the effect before administering it,' he told a recent conference in Berlin, where he received the Ernst Schering Prize.The licensing process will take about a year and will be reviewed by at least four ethics committees, as well as the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority's science and clinical review boards.Prof Wilmut, who is supported by Geron Corp of Menlo Park, California, will not be the first to try.Headlines were made worldwide last year when the American company Advanced Cell Technology, ACT, of Worcester, Massachusetts, reported that it had cloned early human embryos.However, these and other attempts in America and China have shown little apparent success, or failed to produce peer reviewed results.'The scientific rigour of what Roslin produces' would give the field a boost, an ACT spokesman told the journal Science."
telegraph,10/4/2003 16:41,news,"The European Parliament has voted to outlaw therapeutic cloning and research on stem cells taken from human embryos.If the decision is ratified by European Union ministers it will place a massive obstacle in the path of British researchers hoping to develop new treatments for currently incurable diseases such as diabetes and Parkinson's.Scientists have condemned the move, saying the European Parliament had allowed itself to be hijacked by a few zealots opposed to progress.At present, embryonic stem cell research is legal in Britain but banned in other European member states. Other countries have no regulations covering the area at all.Stem cells are 'mother' cells with the ability to turn into different kinds of tissue. Those found in early-stage embryos are 'pluripotent', which means they can potentially become any kind of tissue in the human body.Limitless numbers of stem cells can also be duplicated in the laboratory. Scientists believe with the right chemical cues they could produce replacement tissues for patients suffering degenerative brain illnesses, heart damage and a host of other conditions.MEPs were asked to look at proposals setting quality and safety standards for the donation, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells.But they adopted more than 80 amendments to the original European Commission directive, including banning 'research on human cloning for reproductive purposes'. The amendments also prohibit 'research designed to create human embryos solely for research purposes or to supply stem cells, including by means of the transfer of somatic cell nuclei (cloning)'.Cloned human embryos are excluded as sources of transplant material.There are still a number of stages to go before the amendments can become law. They will be considered by health ministers in June, and ultimately must return to the European Parliament for a final vote.But today's vote has prompted an outcry from scientists and patient groups.Lord May of Oxford, president of the Royal Society, Britain's most eminent scientific institution, said the vote was led by a minority of campaigners who wanted to overturn the decisions of individual members states.He said: 'The original intention of this laudable directive was to protect the health of the recipients of donated tissues or cells, but a small group of zealots wants to widen its scope dogmatically to impose their views on the people of the European Union.'He added that British MPs and peers voted by majorities of more than two to one to allow the embryonic stem cell research under strict regulations.A Mori poll earlier this year had shown that most members of the public supported the research."
dailymail,28/05/2015 18:17,sciencetech,"The first modern humans to arrive in Europe and Asia migrated north out of Egypt around 55,000 years ago, according to new genetic research.The study has answered a long standing question about the route early Homo sapiens took when spreading from the African continent.It shows most Europeans and Asians living today are more closely related genetically to people living in Egypt than in Ethiopia.This suggests Egypt was the last stop for people migrating out of Africa 55,000 years ago rather than taking a more southerly route through Ethiopia.Some scientists believed that humans may have travelled from Ethiopia across the Bab el Mandeb strait to the Arabian Peninsula.However, the new research suggests a northern route from Egypt, through the Sinai peninsula and then out into Asia and Europe was the most likely route.The findings also support evidence that these first humans to leave Africa came into contact with Neanderthals in the Levant at the time.Dr Toomas Kivisild, an anthropologist at the University of Cambridge who helped lead the study, said: 'While our results do not address controversies about the timing and possible complexities of the expansion out of Africa, they paint a clear picture in which the main migration out of Africa followed a Northern, rather than a Southern route.'His colleague Dr Luca Pagani, a geneticist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the University of Cambridge, added: 'The most exciting consequence of our results is that we draw back the veil that has been hiding an episode in the history of all Eurasians, improving the understanding of billions of people of their evolutionary history.'It is exciting that, in our genomic era, the DNA of living people allows us to explore and understand events as ancient as 60,000 years ago.'To conduct their research, which is published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, the researchers analysed the entire genomes of 225 people from modern Egypt and Ethiopia.Previous studies have shown that the modern populations in these countries have genes that have flowed in from West Asia, so the researchers masked these modern Eurasian contribution to the genomes.They found that the remaining genomic regions from the Egyptian samples were more similar populations who lived outside Africa than the remaining regions in the Ethiopian samples.The researchers also estimated that people European and Asian populations appear to have split from the Egyptian genomes around 55,000 years ago. They last shared a common ancestor with Ethiopian populations 65,000 years ago.This suggests that Egypt was most likely to be the gateway through which Homo sapiens spread out of Africa around the world.Dr Christ Tyler-Smith, another of the studies authors at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said: 'This important study still leaves questions to answer.'For example, did other migrations also leave Africa around this time, but leave no trace in present-day genomes?'To answer this, we need ancient genomes from populations along the possible routes.'Similarly, by adding present-day genomes from Oceania, we can discover whether or not there was a separate, perhaps Southern, migration to these regions.'Our approach shows how it is possible to use the latest genomic data and tools to answer these intriguing questions of our human origins and migrations.'"
telegraph,2/8/2010 9:36,news,"The first trials of an embryonic stem cell treatment on humans are to begin after California-based biotech firm Geron was given permission by the US authorities. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)   has authorised Geron to carry out the   world's first clinical trials using stem cells derived from human embryos. It plans to test the therapy on volunteer patients paralysed by spinal cord   injuries, in the hope that this will prompt damaged nerve cells to regrow,   enabling the patients eventually to recover feeling and movement.However, the Vatican condemned the   authorisation as 'unacceptable'. Elio Sgreccia, emeritus head of the Pontifical Academy for life, told Radio   Vatican at the weekend: 'Despite the efforts that are made to deny it,   science continues to show us that the embryo is a human being in the   making.' Embryos are 'sacrificed to extract the stem cells from them,' Sgreccia said,   adding that such a technique 'from an ethical point of view can only receive   a negative judgment'. Embryonic stem cells are highly versatile, primitive cells capable of   developing into any tissue of the body. The Geron trial won initial FDA approval in January last year but was put on   hold because of safety concerns. The Catholic Church is opposed to therapeutic research on stem cells drawn   from human embryos, although not if the stem cells are drawn from the   umbilical cord or parts of the adult body such as the intestine or the   retina.

telegraph,9/2/2011 19:00,news,"The genetic code of one of the most deadly cancers has been mapped by scientists for the first time in a breakthrough that could 'transform' our understanding of the disease.The blueprint uncovers many of the mutations and genetic damage that drives   prostate cancer and could lead to new treatments and better diagnosis. Such a detailed picture of the fundamental causes of the disease will lead to   earlier detection and new breeds of drugs to reverse the damage. Eventually it could lead to patient's having their own 'cancer chart'   drawn up which could be used by doctors to provide 'made to measure'   personal care. Dr Mike Berger, lead author at the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard, said: 'This   is a transforming moment in understanding the underlying biology of prostate   cancer.  'It offers the potential of new targets for treatment and earlier   diagnosis of the more aggressive strains of the disease.' All cancers are caused by damage or mutations to the DNA of formerly healthy   cells acquired during a person’s lifetime. This damage causes them to grow into abnormal lumps or tumours and spread   around the body disrupting its normal processes and eventually – if   unchecked – causing death. Dr Berger and colleagues sequenced the genomes of seven different prostate   cancer tumours and compared them to healthy tissues to find where they had   been damaged or mutated. They found more than 21,000 mutations – like spelling mistakes – in the seven   tumours as well as more than a 100 'rearrangements' where whole   sections of DNA have broken free and reattached to other parts of the   genome. Most of these alterations to the normal genome are known as 'passengers'   and cause damage but not cancer. However a small number are called 'drivers' and these lead to the   disease. By sequencing many more cancer patients over the next few years, the   researchers hope to distil down the mix until they have a handful of targets   to hit with treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. “Whole genome sequencing gives us fascinating new insights into a category of   alterations that may be especially important in prostate cancer,” said Dr   Levi Garraway. “This first whole genome view shows us tantalising evidence for several new   prostate cancer genes that likely would have remained undiscovered had we   not been taking a genome-wide approach.' Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer among British men, affecting a   third of men over the age of 50 and accounting for about 10,000 deaths every   year in England and Wales. It is second only to lung cancer in terms of loss of life. Dr Kate Holmes, the Prostate Cancer Charity's Research Manager, said: 'This   is one of the first studies to examine the sequence and structure of the   genetic code as a whole, rather than one or more single genes alone. 'This has allowed the researchers to identify specific patterns where   large disruptions in the structure of the genetic code have taken place. 'These disruptions can rearrange the way genes fit together and the way   they function, which is often associated with the development of aggressive   prostate cancer. 'This is interesting research that highlights a new approach to   understanding the way prostate cancer develops. However, only 14 tissue   biopsy samples were analysed in total. The next stage will be to repeat the   study on a much larger scale, which will be an extensive piece of work.'The latest research is published in the journal Nature. "
telegraph,16/11/2001 00:00,news,"THE Government's attempts to ban human cloning were in tatters yesterday after the High Court ruled that it was not regulated by law.Mr Justice Crane ruled that an organism created by cloning technology was not an embryo, and so was not covered by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.It was under the Act that the Government earlier this year set up regulation of cloning, banning it as far as human cells were concerned except to create a viable organism for research purposes up to the age of 14 days.The ruling is a victory for the ProLife Alliance, a campaign group opposed to experimentation on human embryos or organisms, which brought the case challenging the Government's position.But while the creator of Dolly the sheep said the ruling would help to clarify the law, some scientists feared that it could hold up life-saving research. Others said the loophole could allow the cloning of babies in Britain.The ProLife Alliance, supported by the Catholic Church, challenged the decision to allow limited human cloning, which it opposes because it involves 'the deliberate creation and destruction of new human lives'.Giving judgment, Mr Justice Crane said the central issue was whether a cloned embryo fell within the definition in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. That Act defines 'embryo' as 'a live human embryo where fertilisation is complete'.A cloned embryo produced by cell nuclear replacement - the term for the Dolly cloning method - does not involve fertilisation. Instead, it is created by inserting a cell's nucleus into an emptied unfertilised egg.In January, Alan Milburn, the Health Secretary, made regulations aimed at licensing research on stem cells - cells removed from an early embryo which have the potential to develop into all tissues types. Such cells may hold a key to treatment for degenerative and other diseases.The judge said he could not re-write the legislation to mean what the Government wanted it to. He granted ProLife's application for judicial review and ordered the Government to pay its costs.Bruno Quintavalle, the director of the pressure group, said: 'The upshot of the judgment is that there are no safeguards to stop any form of cloning in this country.'The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has no power to stop it; it isn't a criminal offence and there is nothing that any public authority can do. The law as it stands is hopeless and we are glad we have shown up the Government lie that human cloning is prohibited.'Dr David King, of Human Genetics Alert, said the ruling could aid the controversial Italian fertility expert Dr Severino Antinori, who has said he wants to conduct research on the cloning of babies in Britain. 'Professor Antinori could start his cloning work in Britain today,' he said.The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said: 'We are disappointed by this ruling and understand that the Government may appeal or consider emergency legislation'.But a spokesman said that, under the 1990 Act, licensed centres were required to carry out suitable practice. Because reproductive cloning was deemed unsuitable, 'a licensed centre carrying out such a procedure would be at risk of losing their licence'.Other leading scientists welcomed yesterday's decision. 'This judgment clarifies the legal situation,' said Prof Ian Wilmut, of the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, who led the team that cloned Dolly. 'We expect that the Government will submit new legislation to regulate cloning and specifically to prohibit reproductive cloning.'Yesterday's ruling does not appear to affect changes approved by Parliament that paved the way to scientists dismantling spare IVF embryos for stem cells."
telegraph,5/9/2007 15:31,news,"The Government's fertility watchdog has  agreed in principle  that British scientists should be able to create human-animal embryos after warnings it would be a major blow to science if they refused to allow it.                                       The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) agreed that scientists should be able to create hybrid embryos to extract stem cells for research.         It found that the public was mostly 'at ease' with the proposals once they understood the  full research implications.         The studies could yield new treatments for diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease.         The decision means applications from scientists at King's College London and Newcastle University can now be appraised by a licence committee in November.         Dr Stephen Minger, from King's College London, has applied to the HFEA to create embryos using eggs taken from cows which have had their genetic material removed and replaced with human cells.         The aim is to create stem cells which can be manipulated in the laboratory to mimic human cells with genetic neurological diseases so potential therapies can be developed.         Another application has been submitted by Dr Lyle Armstrong and his team at Newcastle University to carry out basic research using stem cells taken from hybrid embryos.         Hybrids have already been created in China.         A row erupted last year after a Government White Paper proposed banning the technique following a backlash from a public consultation.         Scientists warned the consultation had been skewed by pro-life groups and so the HFEA carried out its own.         In the meantime, the Government has published a draft Bill which would allow hybrid cytoplasmic embryos created using cloning techniques.          These embryos are more than 99% human, with around a 0.1%  animal component, possibly made using eggs from rabbits or cows.          They are welcomed by scientists who say they could provide  a plentiful supply of stem cells for medical research.         The nuclei containing DNA from human cells, such as skin cells, would be transferred to animal eggs that have had almost all their genetic information removed.          A certain amount of animal DNA remains in the stem cells, which would  then grown in a laboratory.          The Bill does not allow 'true hybrids' however -  where a human egg is fertilised with animal sperm or vice versa.         The joint scrutiny committee said this should be removed and research allowed on all hybrids.         Phil Willis, the Liberal Democrat MP for Harrogate and Knaresborough who is chairman of the committee, said it was likely the final Bill will be amended to reflect this before it went to MPs.         He said: 'It would be fairly logical for the HFEA to go ahead and decide these licences.'         The Government's chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, is a high-profile dissenter.         He has said that mixing human cells with animals cells should not be permitted and it has been suggested that if the research is allowed he may have to resign.         Mr Willis said: 'Liam Donaldson has taken a very hard line on this. To have the CMO talking about 'yuk' factors is not acceptable.'"
telegraph,17/08/2010 10:02,news,"The Human Microbiome Project is analysing our microbes to advance medicine. By Michael Day.In front of the doctors’ eyes, the young girl’s life was draining away. The   two-year-old patient at Massachusetts General Hospital was suffering from   life-threatening diarrhoea, and nothing the paediatricians could do seemed   to work. A last-resort therapy using an antibiotic called vancomycin had   failed. They turned to experimental, unlicensed antibiotics but these, too,   had no effect. Running out of time and options, the doctors in Boston decided to take drastic   action: rather than trying to get rid of the bacteria that were causing the   disease, they introduced more – taken, in what must have been a distinctly   unpleasant exercise, from faecal matter found in the gut of a healthy   individual. Within weeks, the child had made a full recovery. Scientists suspect that some   patients fail to respond to conventional treatment for intestinal infections   because they are lacking certain bacteria, which have a protective role,   found in the normally functioning gut. This bizarre case offers a striking example of the vastly important job that   the unseen bacteria and microbes that live in and on our bodies play in   human health. Our gastrointestinal tracts are home to more than 10 trillion   bacteria, where they make essential amino acids and vitamins, help regulate   our immune systems and break down starches and proteins. In total, there are   more than 10 times as many microbes in our bodies as there are human cells;   the total number of different species is thought to be in the thousands. Unfortunately, when it comes to explaining how man and bacteria interact, we   have surprisingly little idea – as the case of the life-saving treatment in   Boston shows. Scientists hope, however, that this is about to change, thanks   to the Human Microbiome Project – an ambitious research exercise funded by   the US government that might have a lower profile than the Human   Genome Project that preceded it, but could have equally important   implications. As Professor George Weinstock explains, millions of years of evolution have   seen man and microbe come to depend on each other to a remarkable degree.   “We should no longer think of these organisms in isolation,” says Prof   Weinstock, a geneticist at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri.   “They’re more like additional organs of our bodies.”The project is dedicated to sequencing the genomes – that is, the genetic   content – of the 900 or so species of microbes found in our bodies that   scientists have so far been able to culture in the laboratory. Using samples   from 300 volunteers, the researchers hope to determine whether we share a   core microbial genome, or “microbiome”, and pin down the ways in which   changes in the microbiome are correlated with human health and disease. Before the project started, only 20 of the 900 species had been sequenced. But   two years in, progress is speeding up, and in May researchers published the   genetic secrets of another 178. The remaining 700 should be completed within   the next two years. “The actual sequencing of the organism itself is immediately useful and   revealing,” says Prof Weinstock. “Straight away, we get a feeling for the   organism. We get to see which genes are present and learn about the proteins   it makes, and how it might interact with our bodies or other microbes.”Dr Karen Nelson of the J Craig Venter Institute   in Rockville, Maryland, is another participant in the Human Microbiome   Project, and is distinctly upbeat about what it will mean in terms of   medical advances. “We expect to see important developments in the next few   years against a variety of cancers, particularly of the digestive tract, as   well as Crohn’s disease, psoriasis and stillbirths due to bacterial   vaginosis,” she says. As well as our guts, the researchers will be concentrating on the bacteria   that live inside our mouths, as evidence builds that they can cause   inflammation in other parts of the body, and ultimately damage distant   organs such as the heart. One link was dramatically illustrated in July this   year, when researchers at New York University published the first long-term   evidence that gum disease increases the risk of Alzheimer’s-associated   memory loss. The team, led by Dr Angela Kamer, suggested that the activity   of some bacteria in the gums contributed to brain inflammation and the nerve   cell destruction seen in Alzheimer’s patients. Meanwhile, scientists are also finding bacteria where they’re not supposed to   be. In February, British scientists at Imperial College London revealed that   our lungs are teeming with different species of bacteria – which, says study   leader Dr William Cookson, throws into question the long-held medical belief   that our lower airways are sterile. He adds that it is “striking” that he   found species of Haemophilus, Moraxella and Neisseria bacteria in the lungs   of asthma patients, which are often found in throat swabs taken from   asthma-prone babies. He suspects that scientists are on the verge of finding   a large group of microbes that are linked to the disease. Yet despite the scale of the effort thus far, the challenge for scientists is   greater still. Due to their complex interactions with their human hosts,   many kinds of bacteria are unable to survive in the test tube, and so cannot   be sequenced. All told, there are hundreds, maybe thousands of species   inside us that have yet to be cultured in a lab, or even identified. Fortunately, the emerging science of metagenomics allows us to go at least   some way towards identifying these species. This scatter-gun approach, in   which researchers effectively grind up the cells present in a sample,   extract the DNA and then sequence it all, reveals the genetic make-up of all   the different species that are present. Researchers also hope this approach   will shed light on the interactions between microbes, as well as those with   their human hosts. “In this way, we’ll learn about the genome of the whole community, with all   its different bacteria,” explains Prof Weinstock. “We don’t want to be too   reductionist about things, because these bacteria don’t exist in isolation.”This point was underlined by recent research suggesting viruses that are found   inside bacteria also play a part in the complex relationship between man and   microbe. The study, by Prof Weinstock’s colleague Dr Jeffrey Gordon,   suggests that these viruses could be inserting their own genes into those of   the bacteria that live in our guts and other organs, thereby influencing   their behaviour. Metagenomics is likely to shed more light on this exciting   new area, as well. However, Dr Andrew McBain, who has studied human-microbe interactions at the   University of Manchester, says the techniques do create problems. “The newer   sequencing technologies that the Human Microbiome Project depends on produce   a daunting amount of data,” he says. “The real challenge is in the initial   experimental design and the interpretation of the vast amounts of data.”But provided the analysis can be done, the benefits will be huge. “Looking to   the future,” says Prof Weinstock, “I can imagine in 15 years’ time, the goal   will be to look at a person’s microbes and ensure the right balance is there   and make adjustments if necessary to keep that person in optimal health.”And could that include the introduction of artificially engineered microbes,   to further boost our well-being? “Of course that’s what we’d like to do,” he   says “But we’re going to have to understand an awful lot more to improve   upon the systems that evolution has had millions of years to come up with.”"
telegraph,24/10/2010 07:15,news,"The parents of a severely disabled girl have told of their desperate bid for treatment at a controversial stem cell clinic in Germany. For Sarah and Tristan Heal, like hundreds of other parents around the world,   the XCell-Center offered them a hope. Their four-year-old daughter Lauren, known to all as Lolly, is severely   disabled. She cannot walk and she cannot talk; she is visually impaired – or   cortically blind to give it the correct medical term – and unable to hold   her head up. Lolly was born a perfectly healthy baby but in April 2008, just after her   second birthday, she was struck down by a virus that nearly killed her. Her heart became enlarged, then she suffered a stroke and finally severe brain   damage when her heart stopped pumping for 25 minutes before doctors brought   her back from the dead. In all she spent 16 months in hospitals in Bristol before finally being stable   enough to be allowed to return to the family home in Swindon. Understandably, Sarah and Tristan will try anything – pay anything – to help   their daughter get even a little of her old life back. So after seeing an item on the news about stem cell research, Sarah, 34, a   pharmacist, began her own inquiries. She soon discovered official, clinical trials won't use children. The   XCell-Center, the largest private stem cell clinic of its kind in Europe,   was the obvious, perhaps only, option. They contacted the clinic online in February 2009 and filled in the forms,   posting off Lolly's clinical records, including cardiology and neurology   reports. Eight months later, and leaving Lolly at home, they travelled to Germany to   meet the clinicians, including Dr Uta-Kristein Tamaschke, who is now under   investigation over the death of an 18-month-old boy. 'We saw Dr Tamaschke first. She was full of hope and felt it was the   right thing for Lolly,' recalled Sarah. Tristan, 34, a former naval officer who now runs his own software company,   added: 'There were two treatments on the table. Both involved   harvesting Lolly's own stem cells taken from her bone marrow. 'They would then inject them, either by lumbar puncture or else into the   brain. 'Dr Tamaschke recommended the brain one as the most effective. She said   it was a procedure she had done for many years as a neurosurgeon but had   only just started as a stem cell transplantation. 'The procedure was a new application of that technique.'While Dr Tamaschke was keen to proceed, an anaesthetist at XCell was more   cautious. Lolly, who has a weak heart, would have to show signs of   improvement before he would allow the operation to go ahead. Finally, after a favourable report, the couple got the green light and in June   this year the family drove to Düsseldorf for the surgery. Before they went   they had their family portraits taken, fearful Lolly might not survive the   surgery. The Heals didn't know it at the time but a month earlier a ten-year-old boy   had almost died at the clinic when after the stem cell injection into the   brain, he began to suffer internal bleeding. For whatever reason, the Heals who had paid £15,500 for the operation – money   raised through a series of charity events – were suddenly told only when   they arrived at the clinic that the brain injection was no longer suitable. Lolly would be offered instead the lumbar puncture, which costs £7,000 less,   but which might have to be repeated on two or three occasions to be truly   effective. The harvesting of the bone marrow – done under general anaesthetic – went   smoothly; the lumbar puncture caused Lolly distress. 'It left her with nausea and pain that was awful' said Sarah. 'She   was clinically well but suffering from the side effects. She was pretty much   screaming all the way on the drive back to England.'Four months on and Sarah and Tristan are convinced they have seen improvements   in Lolly. By now they should have been sent a questionnaire by the clinic to   fill in showing how they judge Lolly to have responded to the treatment. It is those questionnaires – rather than independent scrutiny – on which the   clinic bases much of its claims for its remarkable success rates. Experts insist that asking patients or parents to fill in forms is no basis   for the claims XCell makes. Sarah said: 'We didn't notice any improvement in the first month but the   thing with Lolly is when she becomes poorly it affects her really badly. 'With the side effects of the treatment, she was really not herself for   probably a couple of weeks afterwards. 'But after that she started to improve. She extends her fingers out now   rather than scrunching them in a tight fist.

Now a table in the online supplemental materials for the Science paper that announced the feat reveals it contained a secret message embedded in the DNA: the code carries the name of the head of the institute, Dr Craig Venter, that of his research institute and co-workers.          His name appears in the synthetic genome as one of five 'watermarks,' sequences of genetic code. Although the genetic alphabet only comes in four letters, the team exploited how they are grouped in units of three, called codons, and each codon is equivalent to one of 20 naturally occurring amino acids.          In this way, they could spell words using the letters for the amino acids that would be produced by the DNA code. One watermark was written 'VenterInstitvte ' because there is no amino acid represented by the letter 'u.'          The other messages were Craig Venter, the Nobel prizewinner Ham Smith, Clyde A. Hutchison III, John I. Glass and Cynthia Andrews-Pfannkoch, coauthors of the synthetic genome paper, see below.          However, this particular genome will not be used for the final fully synthetic organism and it is unclear if the team will watermark its next synthetic genome.          This is not the first time Dr Venter has personalised his work. He used his own DNA in a controversial private effort to read the entire human genetic code and finished off the job this year, marking the ultimate feat of autobiography.

telegraph,30/01/2009 07:01,news,"The symptoms of multiple sclerosis can be reversed with a new treatment using patients' own stem cells, a new study has shown.  Patients reported greater ability to walk and more movement in their joints after a transplant of their own bone marrow cells.Their condition continued to improve for up to two years after the pioneering procedure, doctors found.  Last year experts predicted that stem cell therapy could be used to 'cure' the crippling neurological disease, which affects about 85,000 people in Britain, within 15 years. Sufferers experience fatigue, difficulty walking or speaking and pain.  Caused by damage to myelin, a protective sheath around the body's central nervous system, there is no known cure for MS and few successful treatments. Dr Richard Burt, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, in Chicago, who led the latest study, described it as a 'feasible procedure'  that 'not only seems to prevent neurological progression, but also appears to reverse neurological disability.'Of the 21 patients injected with their own stem cells, 17 found that their symptoms improved while the treatment stabilised the progression of the disease in the others. Doctors currently use drugs to reduce the inflammation caused by the disease but none have been shown to reverse it effects. Stem cells have become increasingly important in medical research for their ability to turn themselves into any kind of cell. The researchers used haemopoietic stem cells, which are found in bone marrow and give rise to all blood cells.Previous research had suggested that they had the ability to help the body to rebuild myelin damaged by MS. The findings, published in the Lancet Neurology medical journal, showed that 81 per cent of patients had significant improvements to their disability. Just five of the group suffered side effects of the treatment and all of these were easily treated with drugs, the researchers report. The volunteers, aged between 20 and 53, were followed for a total of three years, and none of them saw their condition worsen in this time. Dr Burt said that further studies involving a larger number of patients were required to confirm his findings. Professor Gianluigi Mancardi, of the University of Genova, Italy, a specialist in MS, said: 'The results imply this is a valuable alternative to the transplant conditioning therapies used so far.'Dr Doug Brown, research manager at the MS Society, said: 'These are very encouraging results and it's exciting to see that in this trial not only is progression of disability halted, but damage appears to be reversed.'Stem cells are showing more and more potential in the treatment of MS and the challenge we now face is proving their effectiveness in trials involving large numbers of people.'However, he added a note of caution that the trial had been carried out in conjunction with placing the patients on a drug, called alemtuzumab, which has been shown to halt the progression of the disease.

telegraph,17/09/2012 20:51,news,"The 'third-parent’ IVF technique is a potential clinical triumph but researchers must tread carefullyScience has taken human reproduction some way from its natural roots. Since   the birth of the first “test tube” baby, Louise Brown, in 1978, we have seen   babies created from donated eggs or donated sperm, and babies gestated in   donated wombs.But one constant has not been overturned to date, the one which says children   must be the genetic offspring of just two adults. For all the recent   advances in Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART), the notion that a child   could be born containing DNA from three people seems to move the game on to   a whole new level of complexity and controversy. For this marks a profound,   philosophical step change from what has come before, raising questions not   only of safety but deeper issues of identity and parenthood.As The Daily Telegraph reported yesterday, Professor Lisa Jardine, the head of   the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, has announced a public   consultation on “three-parent IVF”. If the findings are positive (and polls   suggest support), the currently banned technology, pioneered by scientists   at Newcastle University, could be legalised within five years, making   Britain the first country to allow this technique.Horrified opponents say this move is a lurch into the dark, an unethical   attempt to meddle with the precious human germline. To supporters, it is   simply a practical and ethical way to end the misery of what are known as   mitochondrial diseases (including muscular dystrophy and ataxia, which   causes problems with speech and co-ordination) that affect 0.5 per cent of   births in the UK.There is certainly a good argument to be made for “three-parent babies”. The   new technique does not involve nuclear DNA, the genes that are responsible   for our biological identity, but the DNA in mitochondria. These are the tiny   “organelles” that sit in the cytoplasm outside the nucleus, and which power   our cells.Some heritable diseases are caused by faulty mitochondria – that can result in   cells malfunctioning or failing completely. The new research aims to   eradicate these conditions, so that women who carry defective mitochondria   can give birth safe in the knowledge that the disease will not be passed on.   One profound effect of the technique would be to eliminate these diseases   completely – and forever – in a single generation. Few medical advances have   the power to reach into the future so directly in this way.What does three-parent IVF actually entail? During normal reproduction, DNA   from sperm is fused with the DNA contained in the egg. The egg also contains   mitochondria (the sperm’s mitochondria are destroyed by the egg and play no   further role). Thus mitochondrial DNA is passed on exclusively down the   female line and it is from mothers (who may or may not have symptoms) that   mitochondrial diseases are inherited. Break that link and the problem   vanishes.There are two variations of the technique now in the spotlight, and both have   been extensively studied at Newcastle University, one of the world’s leading   centres in reproductive medicine that regularly generates headlines for   pioneering work in stem cell research, human cloning and advances in ART.One method, called spindle transfer, involves the removal of the nuclear   material from the mother’s egg, which is then placed into a donor egg   “shell” containing healthy mitochondria but no nuclear DNA. This egg is then   fertilised, in vitro, by the father’s sperm. The second technique, called   pronuclear transfer, involves the creation of two embryos in vitro, one   using sperm and an egg from the parents, the other from donors. The donor   egg is then ennucleated – it has its central genetic material removed and   replaced by the genetic material taken from the parental egg.Although it sounds more complex – scientists would need to perform two in   vitro fertilisations rather than one – the researchers involved say there   are distinct advantages to the pronuclear transfer technique, because an   unfertilised egg is more susceptible to damage during the spindle transfer   procedure. It is likely that pronuclear will be the preferred technique.Either way the result is the same – a new embryo containing genes from father,   mother and mitochondrial DNA from a female egg donor who does not need to be   related to either parent. The resulting baby will, the scientists say, be   genetically the child of its parents and not the egg donor. The technique   has been likened to changing the batteries in a laptop computer; the hard   drive, which contains all the important data, is unchanged.In fact, in a profound way it can be argued that mitochondria are not really   part of us at all, but a form of modified bacteria. The prevalent theory is   that around two billion years ago, the ancestors of today’s mitochondria –   bacteria – invaded a primitive cell and somehow managed to avoid being   consumed, instead setting up home in the cytoplasm. The presence of the   mitochondria hugely increased the amount of energy available to the host   cell, synthesising the chemical adenosine triphosphate – “the fuel of life”   – which is essential for all cellular activity. A successful symbiotic   relationship was thus established. This in turn allowed evolution of complex   life – plants and animals. Indeed, if it had not been for that chance   encounter a couple of billion years ago, life on Earth may never have passed   the microbial stage.Many people are, predictably, horrified by the new research and the prospect   of a third, or “mitiochondrial”, parent. The Catholic Church opposes IVF on   ethical and religious grounds. First, IVF separates the process of   procreation from marriage, and worse, in the Church’s eyes, many IVF   techniques involve the creation of embryos which are then discarded. Other   religions have varying objections, too. Sunni Islam generally permits ART,   provided there are no third-party elements to the procedure, whereas Shia   followers are told that this is permitted.Then there is the identity problem. Children born of donated sperm or eggs   already have to reconcile the fact that their social identity (their   upbringing) does not correspond to their genetic identity. Add in a “third   parent” and the issue of “Who am I?” becomes still more acute. Your   mitochondria may not be as important as your cell nuclei, but they are still   very much a part of who you are. Would a woman who donated her mitochondrial   DNA have any rights – or, indeed, responsibilities – towards a child (as   sperm donors do today)?What about safety concerns? A serious objection is that anything which   involves tampering with the human germline takes us into uncharted waters.   Current gene therapies only last as long as the individual patient treated –   any changes you make to your DNA in your lifetime cannot be passed on. But   changes made to the germline will be inherited as long as (in this case) the   female line continues.However, concerns expressed by some critics, that the baby resulting from this   new technology will contain “foreign” genes, are misplaced. According to   Professor Mary Herbert, one of the researchers taking part in the Wellcome   Trust funded project, the basis of reproduction in nature always involves   “alien” genomes. “The male genome is a foreign genome and it gets stuck in   and talks to the mitochondria and gets down to business,” she says. Mice   have been bred using the three-parent technique since 1983 and after many   generations, no problems have emerged.Furthermore, this technology does not entail the creation of “designer   babies”, the term used to refer to theoretical future attempts to tweak the   nuclear germline to produce gifted or super-fit progeny. What is being   proposed is simply the replacement of faulty cellular material, not the   enhancement of the core genome. While it is likely that a small number of   the “faulty” mitochondria will be carried over into the new egg, perhaps 1   to 2 per cent, according to Prof Herbert, this is “highly unlikely to cause   disease, which normally needs a threshold of 60 per cent of damaged   mitochondria”.Nevertheless the possibility that the “new” mitochondria (from the donor egg)   could fuse and swap genes with those carried over from the biological mother   raises possible concerns, which will only be addressed when the embryos are   allowed to develop beyond the earliest stages (14 days), the point at which   the law currently says experimentation must stop.Finally there is the issue of how much we understand the complex interplay of   genes, proteins and non-coding DNA in both mitochondria and cell nucleii.   Just last week  research was published showing that our DNA is less a recipe   book than a complex library, with an indexing system as important as the   books.Animal studies so far show that this three-parent technology is safe but,   until the first babies are born, we will never know for certain. “It’s all   about the balance of risk,” says Professor Herbert. “There are always   elements of the unknown in any new treatment. But we have no evidence of   anything cataclysmic that will happen.”"

These early embryos, called blastocysts, consist of about 100 cells of two types: those that turn into the placenta and those, in the 'inner cell mass', which turn into the embryo. The latter will be grown in the bank, subject to a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and permission of the parents.Efforts to create embryonic stem cell lines have been started in Britain by Dr Austin Smith of the Centre for Genome Research, Edinburgh. Another human embryonic cell line has come from Prof Roger Pedersen, who left the University of California, San Francisco, to work at Cambridge University. Several other British teams are also lining up to create human cell lines.Medical Research Council backed research on human embryonic cells will require scientists to deposit resulting cell lines in the bank.Estimates suggest around 37 lines of human embryonic cells have already been derived worldwide, of which a dozen are of sufficient quality to bank. The home for the bank will be decided by the MRC's council in July."
telegraph,18/11/2000 00:00,news,"TONY BLAIR warned yesterday about what he called the 'anti-science' culture that had fuelled protests against embryo research, animal testing, genetically modified crops and other controversial scientific experiments.The Prime Minister insisted that there could be 'more than one morally acceptable outcome' in the debate on stem cell research, which many people oppose outright on religious or moral grounds. His remarks suggest that government ministers will turn out in force to vote for new regulations permitting stem cell research when they are put to a free vote in the Commons and the Lords in the next two months.The regulations - if passed - will permit experiments banned on the Continent. There was more evidence of Government support in the Commons when the minister for public health, Yvette Cooper, pleaded with MPs not to vote against the new regulations. Mr Blair also criticised the groups who have taken direct action to prevent the introduction of GM crops in Britain.He told the European Bioscience Conference in London: 'There is a danger, almost unintentionally, that we become anti-science. Our conviction about what is natural or right should not inhibit the role of science in discovering the truth - rather it should inform our judgment about the implications and consequences of the truth science uncovers.'He said: 'Sometimes it is controversial, as with GM crops or animal testing. Such research is, rightly, strictly regulated. But this Government will not tolerate blackmail, even physical assault, by those who oppose it. To do so would be to give in to intimidation. To stand by as a successful British science once more ends up being manufactured abroad.'He made it plain that his wish to rally public opinion behind these new branches of science was influenced by the potential economic benefits. The European biotechnology market is expected to be worth more than £60 billion, and to employ up to three million people, by 2005. Although British companies were in the lead, other European Union countries were catching up.Mr Blair said: 'Biotechnology is the next wave of the knowledge economy and I want Britain to become its European hub.' The Department of Health believes that stem cell research, which involves taking cells from embryos in the first 14 days after conception, could provide a cure for spinal injuries and illnesses such as Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's."
dailymail,18/03/2015 14:50,wires,"With his half-acre banana plantation, Charles Semakula can put his family's favourite food on the table every day.Green cooking bananas, or matooke, are a feature of almost every main course for 38-year-old Semakula, his wife and four children, while sweet yellow ones make for pudding.Matooke is a national staple in Uganda, and many say a meal isn't a meal without it.'When I spend a week without eating matooke, I don't feel good,' said Semakula, who lives and farms 16 kilometres (10 miles) outside the capital Kampala. 'It's rare not to find it regardless of what part of the country you're in.'But in recent years a deadly bacterial disease, known as 'banana wilt', has had a devastating impact, driving some farmers to abandon their beloved crop altogether. It has also sparked a Ugandan version of the global row over genetically modified (GMO) foods.Across the world, heated debate surrounds the development and use of new foods whose DNA has been manipulated to incorporate traits not found naturally.Backers claim that engineered strains offer a future of plentiful crops, resistant to drought and disease.Their opponents insist that the long-term health risks and environmental impacts are not known, and warn that global corporations behind GMO foods exercise undue influence over governments and farmers.With his banana crop under threat, Semakula is among those who want Uganda's parliament to pass a contentious bill permitting the use of GMO crops in the hope it will deliver disease-resistant bananas.Supporters of the GMO bill argue that the crops are both safe and vital for the health of Ugandans.'We are interested in solving a problem,' said Professor Wilberforce Tushemereirwe, director of research at the National Agricultural Research Laboratories.Uganda has been conducting trials of disease-resistant GMO bananas since 2007. In 2010 government scientists expanded the range of tests to include rice, maize, cassava and sweet potatoes.But for Semakula, it is all about the banana, while his faith in the government is total. 'Vaccines and drugs come into the country. I don't need to know where they came from, how they process them. Government approves and I benefit. My confidence is in the government,' he said.- 'A neo-colonial conspiracy' -Others however are sceptical.'It's a neo-colonial conspiracy to make the developing world more dependent on food and seeds from rich governments and corporations,' said Edie Mukiibi, 28, who grows 12 different varieties of banana on his farm in Mukono, in central Uganda.Opponents of GMOs argue that they threaten the sustainability of farming in Africa with accompanying restrictions that remove farmers' right to choose their own crops and seeds.'Real nutrition is when you have diversity of crops in your garden to choose from, not having only one crop everywhere,' said Mukiibi, who is also a vice-president of the Ugandan branch of the global organisation Slow Food International, which rejects GMOs and advocates 'good, clean and fair food.''GMOs are unreliable from a scientific point of view, inefficient in economic terms and environmentally unsustainable,' the Italy-based network contends on its Internet site. 'Little is known about them from a health perspective... They have severe social impact, threatening traditional food cultures and the livelihoods of small-scale farmers.'Despite strong opposition, Tushemereirwe expects the bill to sail through Uganda's parliament and claims that GMOs have the backing of President Yoweri Museveni, in public and in private.'The last time I personally talked to Museveni he said: 'You continue with science. When you need a law, I'll give it to you',' said Tushemereirwe.Mukiibi agrees that it is a matter of when, not if, the law is passed and promises to step up his opposition.'We will intensify the campaign to preserve our biodiversity, as well as educating consumers about the problems around GMOs,' he said, adding that farmers need to be advised by 'independent bodies' and not just government-backed institutions.'We cannot just sit and see our rights to choose our planting materials, seasonal cropping and local seed preservation hijacked by a few individuals and corporations who want to own all the seeds on earth.'"
telegraph,27/10/2010 07:30,news,"Young boys facing intensive treatment for cancer could be given the chance to become fathers in the future using their own stem cells, according to new research.Chemo and radiotherapy are often essential for boys with cancers like Hodgkin   lymphoma, but high doses of such life-saving treatment usually come with the   price of sterility.While freezing the mature sperm of teenagers and men who get cancer is a   fairly straightforward procedure, at the moment nothing can be done to   preserve the fertility of such pre-pubescent boys.However, now researchers have succeeded in taking sperm stem cells (SSCs) from   two boys aged six and eight and getting them to multiply in the lab.These cells cannot fertilise an egg. However, the idea is to create enough of   them outside the body to be able to repopulate the testes of men who - as   boys - were made sterile by cancer treatment.Once 'returned' to the mature testes they would naturally develop into   fully-fledged sperm.Dr Hooman Sadri-Ardekani of Amsterdam University, told the annual conference   of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) in Denver: 'For the   adult male it's really easy to freeze sperm but it's not possible because   spermatogenesis has not started yet in young boys.'What can you do for these boys?'According to several animal studies, we could use testicular tissue from   these boys before starting intensive chemotherapy or radiotherapy and   cryopreserve (freeze) the tissue.'Dr Sadri-Ardekani and his colleagues took testicular tissue from the two   Iranian boys and isolated sperm stem cells. .Within three weeks they had established stem cell lines in petri dishes.The team calculated that the cultures needed to be grown for 80 days, and the   number of cells increased by 1,300 times to create enough immature sperm to   give a good chance of 'restoring' fertility in a man.Dr Sadri-Ardekani was confident of their chances.'Can we do this with this system that we have established? I say yes we can.'The medics believe transplanting these SSCs back to the cancer survivors   'should become feasible in the near future'. The doctor admitted the technology behind the approach remained 'experimental'.But he said parents of young boys should be offered the chance of their son's   sperm stem cells being frozen, in the hope that the technique bore fruit   over the coming years. 'We really should offer at least sperm stem cell cryopreservation [freezing]   to these boys to give them this opportunity in the future,' he said.The issue was now more important than ever, he claimed, because better   treatment for childhood cancers meant some 80 per cent now overcame their   disease. One in 250 young adults was now a childhood cancer survivor, he   added.In the UK about 1,600 new cases of childhood cancer are diagnosed each year in   children up to 15. About half are under five when they receive a diagnosis.Despite the study's progress, doubts remain over safety.Studies show that when cells are propagated in vitro for long periods, they   can develop genetic faults.Tony Rutherford, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said of the   research: 'It's a future hope for pre-pubertal boys because at the moment   there's very little we can do.'He said the key was 'making sure that we have got the culture conditions right   and similar enough to what happens in the body to ensure that the cells will   develop, to produce healthy sperm that make healthy babies.''It will be interesting to see what happens over the next decade,' he   concluded."
telegraph,30/10/2001 00:00,lifestyle,"        Dr James Le Fanu on the scientists with stars in their eyes  IF it were possible to build a spaceship that could travel at the speed of light, one could, theoretically, travel to a neighbouring galaxy and back within a single lifetime - but by the time you return to Earth, 30,000 years would have elapsed. This would seem to rule out long distance space travel: were it not that, as Stephen Hawking says, manoeuvring your spaceship into a 'wormhole' would permit you to traverse the universe and be back in time for dinner - or indeed return before you set out.Hawking's observations are in line with a more generalised crisis of credibility that now seems to affect both science and medicine. Last week, for example, a standard crop of improbable research findings emerged. We learnt that 'one day', thanks to biotechnology, electricity will grow on trees and that 'one day' it will be possible to eliminate genetic defects by creating genetically modified 'designer sperm'. Few people are sufficiently well versed in biotechnology or gene therapy to know whether such promises are remotely realistic.It is, however, a reliable rule of thumb, as with all the other current scientific fads, such as cloning and stem cell therapy, that they are not. So, for those wondering whether to bequeath their millions to medical research or medical missions, the missions should win every time.    This week, we have a brace of curious mysteries. Mr C A from London, aged 75, is not surprised to find that he is two inches shorter than when he was a lad - which naturally he assumed must be due to compression of the disc spaces between vertebrae of the spinal column. But when he was recently measured by his tailor for shortening a pair of trousers, he found he had lost one inch on his inside leg. 'How does this come about?' he asks.  Next, Mr B W from Kent says that, when writing, he can form all the letters normally except 'W' - which induces a 'form of self-paralysis'. This is obviously a problem when signing his name.    Finally, a couple of 'matters arising': first, ears again. Jeremy Davis from the Medway Hospital in Kent reports that, astonishingly, 10 per cent of his patients have problems arising from trying to rid their ears of wax with cotton buds, soap and water, power showers, paper clips and even knitting needles. Regrettably, removing the ear wax causes itching, which calls for a further round of scraping the insides of the ear canal. 'This compounds the problem by removing the fledgling ear wax which is trying to return to the outer part of the ear canal.' So the solution is: don't.  There have also been a couple of suggestions for Mr W L of Manchester, much affected by excess hair growth in the ear. He should either consult a traditional barber or purchase a device called Easitrim, which is specially designed to remove excess ear (and nostril) hair.Meanwhile, Mr T R from Bucks has a suggestion for those finding it difficult to detect high frequency sounds. 'My remedy is to make cardboard ear pieces - each about the size and shape of a cupped hand, supported on a piece of garden wire. The difference is amazing,' he writes. 'They are so lightweight I once answered the doorbell wearing them to find a bemused postman wondering why I had pieces of cardboard with Haddock Fillets printed on them over my ears. But I heard every word he said.'Next, Jane Griffiths from London has provided a further selection of lachrymose films and music to add to The Railway Children for those who have difficulty in obtaining emotional release from crying. They include (music) Runaway Train by Soul Asylum, Lifted by the Lighthouse Family, Love Changes Everything by Michael Ball and the Israeli national anthem and (films) Georgy Girl, Goodbye Mr Chips and The Old Maid.Meanwhile, does any reader have advice for Mrs B G from Essex who has the reverse problem? 'Whenever I hear of anything the least bit sad, tears spring to my eyes,' she writes."
telegraph,17/01/2008 12:34,news,"     British scientists have been given the go-ahead to create part-human, part-animal embryos.                                         The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) granted licences to conduct research using hybrids – made from animal eggs that have had their nucleus replaced with human genetic code.               Researchers will now use the technique to create embryonic stem cells in order to study the causes of and develop treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cystic fibrosis, motor neurone disease (MND) and Huntington's.               They originally applied for permission to do the work in November 2006, but the HFEA delayed its decision for 12 months to carry out a public consultation and to wait for the Government to publish new proposed laws governing such research.           A spokesman for the HFEA said: 'The licence committee determined that the two applications satisfied all the requirements of the law and has now offered one-year research licences, subject to a series of detailed conditions in each case.'           Dr Stephen Minger and colleagues at King's College want to use the cloned hybrid embryos from cow, rabbit, sheep and goat eggs to create embryonic stem cells carrying the defects responsible for a range of serious diseases.           Dr Lyle Armstrong and Dr Majlinda Lako at the North East England Stem Cell Institute in Newcastle plan to insert human skin cells into cow eggs to study how eggs can reprogramme adult tissues into more primitive cells.           Their eventual aim is to develop a way of creating stem cells that could be used to grow new tissue - such as liver, heart and muscle cells - that genetically matches individual patients.          This could then be transplanted without the risk of it being rejected.           Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, of the MRC National Institute for Medical Research, said:  'The HFEA's decision is excellent as it adds to the arsenal of techniques UK scientists can use to provide understanding and eventually develop therapies for a wide range of devastating genetic diseases.           'While scientists may prefer to use human eggs, these are in short supply and preference should rightly be for their use in treating infertility.'           However pro-life groups argued the research was unnecessary and unethical, and that this type of work falls outside the HFEA’s remit.          Calum MacKellar, from the Scottish Council on Human Bioethics, said: 'Scientists are playing the sorcerer’s apprentice in all this.           'We agree with Prof Minger and others that inter-species embryos may have some use for research into Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s and we have a lot of sympathy with patients who are desperate to see treatment for these kinds of disorders.           'However the action of saving life does not trump the action of killing life.' "
telegraph,17/03/2002 00:01,finance,"   Britain's boffins fled abroad, but now they're flocking home. Richard Fletcher explains why  SOMETHING remarkable has happened. After suffering a brain drain for decades, Britain has suddenly become home sweet home once more for its brightest and best researchers and scientists. This spring, a 'brain gain' is under way that could provide a boost to the entire economy.A succession of pioneering scientists and entrepreneurs, working in a wide range of fields, have led the way in recent months. But the stream could soon turn into a torrent since more than half a dozen entire biotech firms are said to be considering moving to Britain, lock, stock and research lab.The interest has been triggered by last month's House of Lords ruling which ended a ban on stem cell research using human embryos. Licensed UK scientists can now push ahead and work with embryonic stem cells - unlike publicly funded researchers in the US.Embryonic stem cells fascinate researchers because they have the potential to become any cell type in the body and scientists believe that in future they could be used to treat a range of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.But in the US, the research remains controversial and federally funded scientists have been banned from working with embryonic stem cells - although private organisations can still conduct research with no legal restrictions.The ban has already led to the departure of Professor Roger Pedersen from the University of California. One of the world's leading stem cell specialists, Pedersen has taken up a post at Cambridge University and more US scientists are expected to follow.'Academics are pretty fluid in their ability to move around these days and if the UK provides the opportunity it could benefit quite substantially,' says Pedersen.Although Pedersen's research in the US was privately funded, the University of California halted the programme when it realised that the federal government considered that Pedersen's use of university lighting and electricity made his work public rather than private.It is not only scientists who are looking to move to the UK. 'We know of at least half a dozen companies that are considering plans to move to the UK,' says Aisling Burnand, the deputy chief executive of the BioIndustry Association.Martin Edwards, the chief executive of ReNeuron, the UK's only publicly quoted stem-cell company, expects a number of other prominent scientists in the field to move to the UK.'I think a number of ex-pats will return to the UK in the next couple of years as a number of academic posts will be created. A number of US companies may also open an operation in the UK,' says Edwards.But although high-profile defections by stem-cells specialists may dominate the headlines, a wide range of bio-tech scientists are returning to the UK.Dr Bob Jackson, the executive director of research and development at Cyclacel, a privately owned Dundee-based bio-tech firm, returned to the UK after 20 years in the US.'There was a feeling that the West Coast bio-tech phenomenon was starting to run out of steam,' says Jackson, although he admits that he misses the US climate.He is not the only ex-pat scientist to have returned to work at Cyclacel. After nine years in the US, Simon Green came back, along with his wife and fellow scientist Dr Susan Davis, in 1999. 'America never became home,' he says.However, although Green is pleased that he has returned to the UK, he is not convinced that much has changed since he left in 1990.'From a career point of view, I have taken a backward step to return. The biotech industry is more established in the US and investors are much more willing to take risks,' says Green.Others are more upbeat. After 13 years in the US, Dr Allan Bradley came back to the UK to head the Sanger Institute, the nation's leading genetics centre, in November 2000.'The fundamental issue in 1987, when I left, was the lack of support - both in terms of salaries and infrastructure. The UK is now more aware of technology and science. The country has changed. Attitudes to scientists have changed,' says Bradley.He argues that investment in new laboratories, particularly by the Wellcome Trust and the Government, has created a strong science infrastructure of modern laboratories. The increased spending by the Wellcome Trust, he adds, has, in effect, created a new funding body in the UK.Spending by the Wellcome Trust - which raised £3 billion between 1986 and 1995 by selling its shares in what was then Wellcome - has risen sharply over the past five years. In 1996, the trust invested £168 million; by 1998 annual funding was more than £200 million a year; and at the beginning of 2001 the trust embarked on a £3 billion, five-year spending programme that will see annual investment of £600 million.It has also attempted to push up salaries in the UK in an attempt to close the brain drain. In June 1999 the trust increased salaries for its UK research fellows by 30 per cent above the basic university pay scale.When Bradley joined from Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, Texas, he refused to take a pay cut.'You cannot expect people to take a pay cut. There is a global market for scientists and you have to compete globally. I have to match US salaries to get the best people,' says Bradley, who argues that as well as luring back ex-pats, it is also important to recruit American scientists.Last year the Royal Society launched a programme designed to attract foreign and ex-pat scientists to the UK. The Royal Society's Wolfson Research Merit Awards are used to top up scientists' salaries - by an average £40,000.The first US scientist - Dr Timothy Karr - to be secured with the help of the grants will arrive next month to take up a post at the University of Bath's department of biology and biochemistry.Professor Peter Taylor is another scientist who has been attracted to the UK - after 13 years in the US - with the help of the Royal Society awards. He was recruited to help create a Centre for Scientific Computing at the University of Warwick - a 'virtual laboratory' which could, for example, be used to compile a shortlist of drugs before moving into a real laboratory.'There is a feeling of optimism among the research community in the UK,' says Taylor, who was formerly the deputy director of the Supercomputer Centre at the University of California, San Diego.A number of bio-tech entrepreneurs are also returning from the US. Next month Peter Chambre will return to the UK as chief executive of Cambridge Antibody Technology.'What has changed is the level of funding that can be raised in the UK,' says Chambre. 'In the past, UK investors have been reluctant to fund companies like CAT. That has changed in the past three or four years.'Andrew Sandham, the president and chief executive officer of Ionix, a privately owned bio-tech firm, agrees that the funding situation has changed.'There is as much venture capital in Europe as there is in Silicon Valley,' he says.Sandham - who was recruited to run Ionix by Apax, the firm's venture capital backer - also believes that the UK has a 'wealth of excellent people'.'There are lots of bright and entrepreneurial people in Silicon Valley, but it is harder to motivate and keep the people actually working in the laboratory.'There is a Californian arrogance. Having a whole team of people who think they can run a company is not always a good thing,' says Sandham.Sir Chris Evans, one of Britain's leading biotech entrepreneurs and chairman of Merlin Biosciences, believes that Government investment in universities has been critical in attracting back scientists.'In the 1980s and 90s scientists didn't come home because there was little venture capital funding and science was very low on the agenda.'Science was poorly underfunded and scientists were second-class citizens. But the conditions are now right. A whole range of grants and schemes has been created,' says Evans.'Europe is finally embracing the bio-tech sector.'"
telegraph,26/09/2001 00:01,men,"   Former Superman actor Christopher Reeve has been confined to a wheelchair for six years. But, he tells Michael Shelden, he will walk again  CLOSING his eyes, Christopher Reeve works his mouth silently and draws air into his lungs through a ventilator tube inserted in his neck. After a few seconds, he has enough oxygen to speak normally and opens his eyes with a look of calm determination.'One thing I've had to learn since my accident is to pace myself,' he says, in a strong voice that must compete with the churning sound of the ventilator strapped to the back of his chair. 'In my position, you can't help but appreciate the virtue of patience.'For six years, Reeve's 'position' has been that of a large, well-proportioned male whose body is cut off from his brain. The riding accident that damaged his spinal cord affected only a small area of tissue - 'smaller than my pinkie', Reeve says - but it was enough to block the signals that normally race from the mind to fingers and toes and command the movements that most of us take for granted.A stunningly handsome man in his youth, he used to require almost no preparation to look his best. He played Superman on the screen with a natural confidence that came from years of hard athletic activity. For most of his life, he was regularly involved in some rigorous endeavour, driving himself relentlessly to become an expert sailor, skier, aviator and horseman.Now, it takes more than an hour for Reeve's assistants just to clothe him in the simple outfit he's wearing today - khaki trousers with a dark-blue jersey. He turned 49 this week and his worn face bears few traces of the exuberant, boyish actor who soared over Metropolis in four films featuring the Man of Steel.Every aspect of his daily care requires someone else's help. Much of that care is the responsibility of his wife, Dana, who oversees a small army of part-time therapists and attendants. A bouncy, energetic woman, she married Reeve only three years before his accident and has been at her husband's side every day since then. She's also the mother of their nine-year-old son, Will. (Reeve has two grown-up children, Matthew and Alexandra, from an earlier relationship.)When I arrive at his spacious farmhouse, 30 miles outside New York City, one of his attendants is slowly feeding him lunch. Quietly, Reeve opens his mouth to accept a forkful of salad, chews it and waits for the next bite. When he's ready for a drink or something else to eat, he asks for it politely and nods when he's finished.Each day, he is lifted from his bed and placed in a motorised chair that he operates by breathing into a straw or 'sipper', as he calls it. This allows him to move around the house with relative freedom, even to the point of venturing outside to his garden by means of a ramp and a level walkway.'I like sitting outside or at the window and watching the birds or the sky. I've learnt how to be peaceful just by looking at trees for four hours. It's something that I never thought of doing before my accident, but I think others should try it. I find it helps me keep up my strength. I can't become obsessed by the things that I'm unable to do.'After enduring so many years of paralysis, Reeve might be tempted to show bitterness and rage, but I see only a remarkably consistent mood of tranquillity and hope. This is all the more impressive because paralysis is not the only thing he's had to endure.'It's not been easy. There have been many complications. I've had pneumonia, two blood clots, a collapsed lung, ulcers and a broken arm. When the doctors discovered that my arm had broken in two after a fall, they had to insert a steel rod. I sat in this chair, covered with a sheet to protect me from blood spatters, and listened to them use a hammer and chisel to drive the rod into place.'I wince and start to ask how he could remain conscious during such a procedure, but catch myself when I remember that his spinal injury works as a sort of anaesthetic.'But that wasn't the worst thing,' he says, in a matter-of-fact tone. 'What I couldn't accept was the day the doctors came to me and said that my leg would have to be amputated below the knee. I'd developed an infection on my ankle that wouldn't heal and they said that it would spread if I didn't have part of my leg removed.'A look of almost fierce resolve appears in Reeve's eye as he explains his determination to keep his paralysed leg intact. The crisis came in 1997. 'I wanted to draw a line in the sand and say: 'That's it. I've had enough. This is unacceptable. I've put up with all that I'm going to bear and the leg is staying right where it is'.'He insisted on receiving an intensive treatment of antibiotics, to 'flush out the infection', and the gamble paid off. The ankle healed and he kept not only his leg but, more important, his dream of walking again, one day.'I do some form of exercise every day to keep my body in shape. I go in the water for therapy, and I also ride a special bike with electrodes that attach to my legs and create the motion that allows me to work the pedals. My body is now in better shape than it's been since the accident.'In fact, the skin and muscles below his neck look firm and healthy. But the physical hardships have taken quite a toll on his face. His skin has a waxen quality, smooth and almost transparent, and his blue eyes have become glassy. As a result of having to spend so much time breathing into a straw for locomotion, his mouth has developed an overbite.For the first few years after his injury, he tried to keep in the public eye, making commercials, directing a film and starring in a remake of Hitchcock's Rear Window. Lately, however, his appearances have been rare.But his gaunt countenance can be deceiving. It takes only a few minutes in his company to see that he still has a quick smile, very alert eyes and a keen sense of purpose in every word he speaks. He firmly believes that he will escape the prison that his body has become.'Well, first of all, I came to terms with being disabled a long time ago. I refuse to let it define me. Second, I know there's a cure coming for the kind of injury that I have. We've established the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation and are spending millions of dollars in support of research that is extremely promising. Just in the past three years, we've seen the emergence of an amazing tool for regenerating spinal cord tissue.'That tool is the stem cell. As a result of numerous experiments with rats, many scientists now believe that stem cells taken from embryos can be engineered to replace dead or damaged tissue in humans. Reeve envisions the day when the right combination of cells can be injected into his spine and initiate a gradual process of recovery.'What I hope will happen is that the injection will start an improvement that will work its way down the spinal cord. I'd be able to breathe on my own again, then regain control of my bowels and bladder, and then my legs. I'm not saying that I might run again, but I'd be happy just to use a walker.'Reeve is ready to have the procedure done as soon as his doctors think it's reasonably safe. He doesn't want to wait until it is proved to be 100 per cent foolproof.'That may take many years to determine. My motto is be safe and then be bold. It would be awful to make anyone remain paralysed for one day longer if we had some realistic cure available. We need urgent action, and that's why my foundation is campaigning so hard for more stem cell research.'Indeed, before the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, Reeve and his colleagues at the paralysis foundation were working feverishly to win more funding from the American government. In August - under considerable pressure from Reeve's various supporters in Congress - President Bush approved limited spending for the cause, as long as existing stem cells were used for research. The president's anti-abortion friends made certain that this compromise didn't allow cells to be extracted from any new embryos.'I don't like the compromise, but - for the time being - it's better than nothing. We'll find a way around it. Either Congress will vote for a change or individual states such as New York and California will fund their own research efforts on stem cells. Right now, everyone's attention is on terrorism, but we can't stop fighting to cure paralysis. The problem isn't going to go away.'While he waits for the ultimate cure, Reeve has been doing everything he can to regain some movement. In the past year, he's made an extraordinary breakthrough on his own, employing nothing more than willpower and intense concentration.'I'm going to show you something that's supposed to be theoretically impossible,' he announces, proudly. 'Watch my index finger and tell me when to start and stop moving it.'I've been staring at his hands lying absolutely motionless on his chair and don't believe that he can move them. But, sure enough, when I say 'start', he raises the finger an inch or two and keeps moving it up and down until I say 'stop'. It's an amazing demonstration.'I can't explain how I've taught myself to do it, but somehow I'm getting a signal down there. Something important is happening. First, I was able to move the finger and now I can also move my thumb and the wrist of my other hand. It's the kind of progress that makes me think that I will definitely walk again. I have the will. All I need is the science.'He can't wait too long. As great as his patience is, there's a limit to what his body can endure. A breakthrough must occur in the next few years, if not months.'I wish that we could make all the doctors and researchers understand our sense of urgency. There isn't any time to waste on unpromising research just because someone's reputation is at stake, or because the funding exists to keep it going. We need to concentrate on the things that can work sooner rather than later.'You know, when the ambulance crew first comes to rescue you after an injury like mine, everyone is full of adrenaline and purpose. Everybody wants to save you. Well, yes, I've been stabilised and I'm improving, but I still need help. And I need it as fast as someone can give it to me. The researchers need to keep that in mind and work with the same sense of urgency that you find in an ambulance crew.'At this point, Dana comes in to check on his ventilator tube and to give him a quick kiss on the forehead. Someone who knows how to clear his tube needs to be near him at all times. If it gets blocked, Reeve will soon run out of oxygen and die. This is the threat that hovers over him constantly.Yet, he doesn't seem to feel the slightest fear. He is lucky to be able to afford good care, and knows he is in capable hands. But he also has real courage, the kind that heroes demonstrate in moments of crisis.Usually, of course, a crisis doesn't last for six years or longer without a break. How does he keep going?'Oh, I have my periods where I'm very jealous of people who can just get up and walk away or go for a swim in the ocean or run down a road. But I get over it.'Before a catastrophe, we can't imagine coping with the burdens that might confront us in a dire moment. Then, when that moment arrives, we suddenly find that we have resources inside us that we knew nothing about. What I've discovered is that we are able - all of us - to do much more than we think we can. Just look at me.'"
telegraph,5/7/2000 0:00,finance,"   Last week's historic breakthrough in sequencing the human genome may seem far from everyday concerns. But, as Liz Dolan explains, genetic knowledge may have an impact on your finances when it comes to life insurance  WE are told that the advances in mapping the human genetic code announced last week will hasten mankind's ability to cure life-threatening illnesses and extend life.                               Breakthrough: Dr John Sulston of the Sanger Centre and Craig Venter of Celera Genomics, the men behind the human genome project          It is of course brilliant news that we may be able to get rid of most, or even all, cancers in a couple of decades' time, for instance. But, purely from the personal finance angle, a greater understanding of the way our genes work looks likely to create as many problems as it solves.When President Clinton was reported as saying earlier last week that little Leo Blair is probably looking at an extra 25 years of life as a direct result of the genome project, my immediate reaction was: God, that means that all the babies born at the moment will have to save even more for their retirement. Sad, I know, but that's personal finance editors for you.But bear with me. Research by Mintel, released last week, indicated that one in four adults still has no pension provision, and one in two saves less than £50 a month. The majority have never heard of the government's new stakeholder pensions, and one in three of the key 25 to 34 age group had not begun saving for retirement.Life and health insurers could have a field day with the results of genetically based tests that indicate which individuals are likely to suffer from which diseases - and when. The more sophisticated the tests become, the more likely insurance companies will be to cherry-pick. Those with suspect genes could become virtually uninsurable.Although genetic testing is in its infancy at the moment, it has already become a hot potato. According to the Association of British Insurers, it is already possible to determine accurately whether people are likely to suffer from one of seven conditions, ranging from Huntingdon's Disease to certain types of Alzheimer's and breast cancer.The ABI's code of conduct on genetic testing bars insurers from demanding that those with a family history of one of these illnesses take a test to find out if they are carrying the relevant gene. Nor may they demand to see the results of any tests already carried out. But they may reject claims from people who have tested positive before taking out a policy and not revealed the result.There are several problems with this code, however. First, it covers only 95 per cent of insurance companies. Second, there is evidence that some of those covered are breaking it. The Alzheimer's Disease Society, for instance, complained to the ABI recently that some proposal forms asked for details of tests.Third, people who may benefit from taking one of these tests may be deterred from doing so for fear of becoming uninsurable. And fourth, there is the question of whether insurers should be allowed access to information about pre-symptomatic tests in the first place.Nick Harvy MP, health spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, last month tabled a 10-minute bill aimed at prohibiting the use of genetic test results for anything other than medical and clinical purposes, and specifically 'to prohibit insurance companies, banks, mortgage providers and employers from requiring genetic tests to be taken, or insisting on the disclosure of the results.'He told MPs that several countries, including Austria, Belgium and Norway, as well as 18 US states, had already passed laws to this effect, while others, such as Australia, France, New Zealand and the Netherlands had voluntary agreements.While it is generally agreed that medical records and medical examinations may be used by insurers to assess risk, this information is historical. Genetic tests, on the other hand, look forward.A handful of insurers, including Standard Life, Cornhill and Virgin, have promised not to take account of any test results when rating applicants for life insurance. Some, such as Cornhill, restrict this ban to contracts worth £100,000 or less.Others, such as Virgin, ignore tests altogether. They point out, quite reasonably, that all applicants are already asked for details of family medical histories and are rated accordingly, so there is no pressing need to demand the results of any genetic tests. But, on the other hand, someone who has tested negative can still benefit from lower premiums.It will be a long time before most of the benefits of the genome project will be felt. But that shouldn't prevent society from putting safeguards in place as soon as possible."
telegraph,21/11/2001 00:00,news,"   Many creatures reproduce without sex - we can't because our parents are engaged in a genetic arms race, reports Roger Highfield     THE Virgin Birth of Jesus has become more miraculous than ever, thanks to the advances in our understanding of what turns a fertilised egg into a baby.                               Madonna and child: if it had been parthenogenesis, Jesus should have been born female          Recent research reveals that every birth is the culmination of a genetic battle. Hostilities are between genes from the mother and those from the father. You might think that if one army deserted the battlefield in the womb, as in a virgin birth, the other army would rejoice in victory. But it turns out that babies need the competition and co-operation of both armies.For millions of years, maternal and paternal genes have co-operated in development to produce offspring, while also vying to get the upper hand. Remove one set, however, and the pregnancy halts or leads to an abnormal birth: women need men to reproduce, and vice versa.We inherit two copies of each gene, one from each parent, but for some genes we use the copy from only one parent. Scientists now realise that one reason for this is imprinting, a mechanism that can switch genes on and off, depending on whether they come from the mother or father.Imprinting is not universal, because many creatures reproduce without sex. If females alone produce offspring, the process is called parthenogenesis and the offspring is female. If males do it, it is called androgenesis. (Here, the sharp-eyed reader will spot one scientific issue regarding the Virgin Birth: Jesus should have been female, discussed below.)Sexless reproduction abounds. Examples range from the timber rattlesnake to species of the Basilisk lizard, sometimes called the 'Jesus Christ lizard' for its ability to walk on water. Even the turkey can do it. But humans have nothing to do with parthenogenesis and androgenesis. The reason is imprinting, which turns on certain genes in sperm but not in eggs, and vice versa. 'Imprinting is a very severe block,' commented one pioneer in the field, Prof Azim Surani of the Wellcome and Cancer Research Campaign Institute of Developmental Biology and Cancer Research in Cambridge.Prof Surani reasoned that organisms with a gift for parthenogenesis should lack imprinted genes. Sure enough, creatures such as snakes and reptiles do not use imprinting.Among vertebrates, imprinting is exclusive to mammals such as humans and occurs when a gene is chemically modified by a process called methylation. Once methylated, the gene is silent. At least 40 genes with diverse functions during development are thought to be regulated this way.When imprinting goes awry the effects are serious. Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, marked by mental retardation and a host of problems, occur when a baby inherits two maternal copies of chromosome 15, or two paternal copies, respectively.In each case, the baby will have copies of a key gene on chromosome 15, but they have come from the mother when they should be from the father, or vice versa. Imprinting prevents them from working. This same genetic division of labour almost certainly thwarts virgin births. But this begs the profound question: why did imprinting evolve?Some think that the activity of certain genes had to be modified by imprinting to allow the evolution of the placenta in mammals, and the embryo to move from an egg to a womb, where it must be able to implant (this is done by a form of the developing embryo that is unique to mammals, called the blastocyst).Another theory, developed by Prof David Haig of Harvard University and colleagues, rests on the most fundamental feature of all life: the urge to propagate one's genes to future generations.Imprinting results from an evolutionary battle between the sexes, reflecting the different genetic agenda of each parent, according to Prof Haig. To put it crudely, both parents want to pass on their genes to their offspring, but a woman's genes also have her interests at heart - unlike the man's. The father wants his offspring to grow big. This will provide his offspring - and his genes - with an enhanced chance of survival and use up the mother's resources so they won't be wasted on another man's offspring.Women, on the other hand, want to share resources with the unborn child and reduce the risk posed by unlimited foetal growth, which would be deadly. The mother also wants to survive to pass on her genes to future children.The result, Prof Haig says, is an arms race, with paternal genes beefing up the offspring and maternal genes holding growth in check. Thus parthenogenetic embryos fail to develop because they contain a double copy of growth-limiting maternal genes without paternal rivals to boost growth.There is evidence for this theory. For example, the gene Igf2 is used in sperm and promotes growth of tissues such as heart and muscle. In contrast, the egg uses Igf2r, a gene that inhibits Igf2.Support has also come from Prof Shirley Tilghman at Princeton, who has crossed wild polyandrous mice, where females have multiple sexual partners, with monogamous mice, in which both parents have an equal interest in the offspring's survival.Prof Haig's theory suggests that the demands of paternal genes should be reduced in monogamous mice and, indeed, crosses of monogamous fathers with polyandrous females created small offspring, reflecting how the former lacked the imprinted mechanism to boost growth while the latter used imprinting to curb growth. Imprinting prevents virgin births in mammals. Studies by Prof Surani have shown that mouse eggs can be stimulated to begin spermless development in test tubes by treating them with chemicals, temperature shifts or electric shocks. A few reach mid-gestation. But all fail before a virgin birth. At the very most, Prof Surani said, virgin conceptions may take place in humans, but will never make it to term. Before Dolly the sheep, imprinting was thought to explain why the cloning of adult mammals had never been accomplished. This is another type of imprinting, used by Nature to ensure that, although every cell in the body has an entire genetic recipe, only relevant 'sentences' are read: those required to make a skin cell, brain cell or whatever. This 'molecular memory', which enables a cell to remember what part of the genetic code to use, is common to all creatures.Because the mammary cell from Dolly's 'mother' only used the relevant genetic code to make a mammary cell, it had been thought this would block the development of all the cells types required for a clone. But this memory was erased by the cloning technique used to breed Dolly.Nor did Dolly overcome the sexual imperatives of imprinting. She simply borrowed imprints from the previous generation - in her case, from the mammary cell of her 'mother'. Dolly relied on the imprints of her grandparents to ensure she developed properly in the womb.But cloning is risky and inefficient. The reason, said Prof Surani, is that the pattern of genes controlled by imprinting is not reproducibly wiped clean by cloning, which can disrupt methylation. 'You may not erase the entire 'molecular memory' of it being a skin cell,' he said. 'If this is faulty, some genes will be used inappropriately, while others are not used.' The miracle of the Virgin Birth underlines why cloning is too dangerous to try on humans.

telegraph,26/11/2001 00:01,education,"   PROF IAN WILMUT, from the Roslin Institute, claims it is too early to say if human embryo is a true clone. David Derbyshire reports  IT is still too early to say if American scientists have succeeded in cloning a human embryo, according to the man who cloned the first animals.Researchers at Advanced Cell Technologies say they have produced at least one six-celled embryo using 'the Dolly the sheep technique'.But Prof Ian Wilmut, who led research on Dolly at the Roslin Institute, believes that there is not enough evidence to say with certainty that the embryos are true clones.But if Advanced Cell Technologies can support its findings, reported by an on-line medical journal, it could mark the most significant development in cloning in five years.Dolly may have become the world's most famous sheep in 1997, but it was the birth of two lambs named Morag and Megan the previous year that ushered in the era of the clone.They were created from single cells removed from a lamb embryo. The technique, known as nuclear transfer, was developed at the Government-funded Roslin Institute in Edinburgh by a team led by Prof Wilmut.Nuclear transfer cloning relies on the fact that almost every cell in the body contains a complete set of genes, the recipe book for creating and maintaining a living organism written in the four chemical letters of DNA.The Roslin team removed a single cell from a lamb embryo and extracted its nucleus, the blob in the centre which contains these genes.The nucleus may have the genetic instructions for an animal, but it needs the protection and chemical machinery of an egg to develop into one. So Prof Wilmut and colleagues took an egg from a ewe's ovary and scraped out its nucleus.The donor nucleus was then transferred to the egg and the egg was kick-started with a burst of electricity. After a few days it was implanted into a surrogate ewe.The resulting lambs, which appeared in one newspaper under the headline 'Monsters or Miracles?' were healthy, identical clones.Cells removed from embryos are relatively easy to clone. The team were interested to see if the same experiment would work in a fully mature adult cell and chose an udder cell that had once been part of a six year old ewe.After 247 attempts, including several still births and aborted foetuses, they produced Dolly. Much of the research into cloning has been driven by the prospects of 'pharming', genetically engineering animals to produce human proteins or pharamaceutical products in their milk or blood.Because splicing human genes into animals is so tricky, the Roslin team developed cloning as a means of mass producing these 'transgenic' animals. But cloning could also help farmers produce the fittest, leanest animals for food.As the Scottish researchers were working on sheep, American, Japanese and French scientists were cloning cattle. The first four cloned calves were born in Japan in 1998. Cattle were followed by Cumulina the mouse, cloned in Hawaii in 1998, and then by Mira the goat, who was born in 1999. The Roslin researchers cloned pigs last year. So far monkeys and apes have proved impossible to clone using the Dolly method - suggesting that humans may also be tricky. The only cloned monkeys have been produced by a far cruder technique known as embryo splitting.The race to clone human embryos was fuelled by recent discoveries about embryonic stem cells. In the late 1990s, scientists found that these master cells could be cultured indefinitely and had the ability to turn into any type of tissue.But over the past couple of years, attention has begun to focus on another type of stem cell, found in fully developed animals and people. Scientists have shown that adult stem cells can be 'reprogrammed' and persuaded to turn into different types of tissue."
telegraph,30/01/2002 00:00,news,"   The genome jigsaw is gradually being pieced together, reports Roger Highfield     THE race to describe the human genetic code, or genome, has reduced people to a recipe of about 30,000 genes. In the past few days, however, important steps have been taken to put the pieces back together and see how this recipe creates the molecular machinery of life.The simple picture is that each gene makes a protein, one of the building blocks of the body. However, although the human recipe consists of about 30,000 genes, there are many more proteins and associated molecules at work in each of your cells.The human genome does not reveal when and where protein molecules become active in cells, how they combine or how they help make other molecules, any more than a list of the contents of a huge kitchen would explain how to cook or how to create a menu. Now scientists are going beyond analysing the genome to decode what they call the 'proteome', understanding the functions of protein molecules and charting the way they behave in living cells to create a complex chemical soup.Proteins work together in molecular machines. About 30 make ATP synthase, a tiny motor that drives metabolism. Another 50 create the ribosome, a 'tape reader' that turns genetic instructions into proteins. In the past few days, an important step towards understanding this molecular machinery was reported in Nature by Drs Anne-Claude Gavin, Giulio Superti-Furga and their colleagues from the biotechnology company Cellzome, based in Heidelberg and Elstree, UK, and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, also in Heidelberg.They investigated the genes in a cell of baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisae, which has a nucleus like human cells. The team modified 1,700 yeast genes so they carried a 'retrieval hook' to show what they were doing, when different proteins form machines to carry out certain jobs in cells.The team can now catalogue the enormously complex relationships between more than 1,400 yeast proteins - which are described by about one quarter of the yeast's genetic code. In all, they found 232 multi-protein machines. They discovered new components lurking in nearly all of the 98 protein machines that had already been described. They also revealed more than 100 new protein machines, ranging in size from two to 83 protein molecules. 'These molecular machines play crucial roles in diseases as well as the everyday life of the cell,' said Dr Superti-Furga.Many yeast proteins with unknown functions turned up in these molecular machines, providing hints about what jobs the molecules perform. The team also found dozens of different machines shared many components, which means that many proteins seem to have more jobs in cells than suspected.However, much work remains. 'And we were looking at a generic sort of yeast cell; as the cell goes through particular parts of its life-cycle, or experiences dramatic environmental changes, it undoubtedly makes use of different machines. Additionally, some machines are probably put together and taken apart so quickly that they may be hard to capture with the present methods,' he said.There are many ways to depict the networks of protein interactions in a living cell. 'You can link complexes by their components, or by known cellular functions. You obtain a picture of a higher level of organisation than we have ever been able to see before,' said Dr Superti-Furga.It's somewhat like looking at a French pointiliste picture. If you stand too close, all you see are single coloured dots. As you move away, you begin to see a coherent image.'These maps will enable researchers to more fully assess the roles of individual proteins in biology and provide for a more comprehensive approach in choosing targets for drug discovery.Yeast and human cells share a very high number of similar machines, composed of related proteins. This means that while individual proteins have changed significantly over the course of evolution, the cells of new species continue to build similar types of machines, using the altered components.Because the team focused on important proteins shared with humans and a range of other creatures, they may have revealed much of the core molecular machinery of life."
telegraph,3/8/2000 0:00,news,"   The science White Paper has opened the way to nurturing our most creative minds. About time, too, says Chris Evans     MORE than two decades ago, Professor Colin Ratledge gave me a PhD project at Porton Down, pointed me at the stars and encouraged me to realise my dreams. I had spent three years at Imperial College studying microbes, then three years with Colin trying to understand how enzymes could make a vast array of novel chemical molecules.That apparently arcane knowledge came in handy in 1987 when I spent £40,000 of my own money to set up Enzymatix, my first (and one of Europe's first) biotech company. Four years later, I and some of my colleagues created Chiroscience for £1 million and, two years after that, floated it for 100 times that amount: today it is worth more than 10 times the flotation price and has merged with Celltech.Now, with a clutch of professorships to fill, and having created 20 bioscience and other technology companies with a capitalisation of more than £1.5 billion, I also spend some time advising the UK Government on science policy and enterprise.And my experience pretty much sums up what last week's White Paper is really about. It is not just the money (though that is important and, yes, still more is needed for British research). It is not just getting more companies to exploit innovation (though that is also critical). It boils down to entrepreneurial scientists: finding the very best, nurturing them and encouraging them to translate their most creative ideas from the laboratory to the market.We need more people like Colin Ratledge, my old commercially minded mentor, not only to inspire the next generation of young scientists, but also to help stimulate a new generation of companies to exploit our world-class science. When ministers unveiled the White Paper last week, Sir Robert May, the Chief Scientist, remarked that we need to find the David (and, I presume, Davina) Beckhams of science.This makes me feel rather good, given that a recent media list of 100 most influential people in Britain places me above David Beckham, but, sadly, just one behind the Pope! But it also reminded me of one particular Beckham of science I had once met in USA. While on a fact-finding mission with Lord Sainsbury, the Science Minister, last year we reported sightings of this mythical beast. We had travelled to America to uncover what creates clusters of successful biotechnology companies. There we visited major technology centres - such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology - and met key architects of the 'Boston cluster'. Most fascinating of all, we visited Seattle on the west coast.There we heard about the ultimate 'cluster thruster'. Not government money. Not venture captial, but Professor Leroy Hood, a giant super-human figure in the field of genomics who is now the William Gates (Bill, to you and me) Professor of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Washington.Lured there by Microsoft money, Prof Hood is now at the focus of a cluster of small bioscience companies that is worth billions. Businesses sprout around him. Local university departments groan with talent. Donations pour in from funding bodies. If I had the chance, I would spend the entire £4 million annual White Paper 'transfer fee' budget on bringing him to Britain. We should transfer Beckham for Hood!Closer to home, I have been helping to initiate a cluster on the estuary of the River Tay. Dundee, is, I admit, probably better known for being the publishing home of the Beano than biotechnology. But in the past few years, highly talented individuals and teams from Cambridge, Oxford and Philadelphia have moved there.At the focus of the cluster is Dundee University. One of its stars, Sir Philip Cohen, is a pioneer in understanding how chemical communication between cells goes wrong and causes diseases such as cancer. Another is Sir David Lane, the discoverer of the p53 gene, a scrap of genetic code that is faulty in more than half of all tumours.You may think that the need to back this talent is so obvious that it is hardly worth stating. Yet only a decade or so ago, there was talk of dividing academic institutions into those that do research and those that do teaching, a scheme which suited bureaucrats but not the scientific superstars in the less distinguished universities.The Government also wanted to build interdisciplinary centres and shift money from basic to applied research to help exploit innovation. But the example of Dundee shows that bricks, mortar and funding are not enough. Only one thing really counts: talent. This was recognised by big charitable donors, such as the Cancer Research Campaign and the Wellcome Trust. Their funding attracted more money, from Scottish Enterprise Tayside, a local economic-development agency.I am more than willing to put my money where my mouth is. A few years ago I was in the Savoy with Sir David and I told him that my venture capital fund, Merlin, has only one aim: to build brilliant new bioscience companies around brilliant scientists.Having spent many hours in the laboratory myself, I know all too well that you cannot ask a scientist of his calibre to take off his white coat and put on a pinstripe suit. All I needed was some of his creativity and a little commitment to the discipline of business and commerce: Sir David has given us that.How much investment are we talking about, he asked me. A few hundred thousand pounds? No. The figures needed to build a successful biotechnology company run into millions. Merlin ended up doubling his salary as well as ensuring David had the bag of share options and equity to motivate him to the moon! This may sound too good to be true: there is a downside to owning a chunk of a company if it fails. The upside is the chance to see basic biology turned into real medicine, saving lives, improving health and creating wealth.Merlin and other investors have now invested more than £20 million in building a company - Cyclacel - around Sir David. We hope to raise another £15 million and then float the company next year because the implications of his work for cancer treatment are so thrilling and his projects are all working.Sir David has a clutch of drugs in development that can fix the damage caused by faulty p53, and related genes that go awry in cancer, such as p16. These drugs are peptides, protein fragments, small enough to penetrate cell walls to take over from the defective genes. Clinical trials are about to begin.We at Merlin have also backed vaccine research with Microscience, vascular therapy with Eurogene, brain repair with ReNeuron, drug delivery with Vectura, gene therapy with BioVex, and many more. That is why I think the White Paper is important.We need to find more Sir Davids and build companies around them. We need to continue the seedcorn funding to incubate those companies, and we need the Government to continue to show the enthusiasm, vision and commitment it has to date. We also need to motivate and encourage more children to take up science and to stay in science as a career. You can have fun, get rich and be famous as a scientist, as well as being a soccer player - why do anything else?I understand it when people say I sit on various Government committees and that this is merely so much spin from one of Tony's cronies. I have indeed seen sycophants creeping around various corridors and task forces wearing dodgy T-shirts and corduroy trousers. I'm genetically incapable of doing that. Indeed, my involvement with Government Bioscience and Foresight committees dates back to the days when Michael Heseltine was president of the Board of Trade.But I do like Blair. I met him days before he got into power and felt he was honest, refreshing and enterprising. At the time, I remember telling him, 'you're going to need bloody good people around you'. In Lord Sainsbury he has a bloody good Science Minister.The White Paper contains many good things that will back those talented and dedicated people in science and, hopefully, stimulate a brain gain for Britain. There are lots of money-backed initiatives being created by this Government and British science needs to take them up. It certainly has my full support and, I know, the support of many other top scientists and entrepreneurs. It is trendy to knock the Government at the moment but I feel it is only fair to also applaud them a little when they are getting things right - and this White Paper is very much in the right direction.n  n  Chris Evans of Merlin Biosciences is a 'serial entrepreneur' and is involved in many Government initiatives. He holds professorships at Imperial College, Exeter, Liverpool and Manchester Universities. He lives in a country house near Abergavenny, an hour's drive by one of his Ferraris from the council house in which he grew up in Port Talbot  n "
telegraph,2/8/2007 0:03,news,"  A special type of cell in the eye has been found to play a key role in restoring vision after extensive damage to the retina and could be used in experimental treatments for blindness within a few years.            In the wake of studies conducted with rats and zebrafish, British scientists believe they may be able to use these cells – known as Müller glial cells – to regenerate damaged retina in humans, according to a study published in the journal Stem Cells.              Diseases damaging the retina including macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetes are responsible for three quarters of  blindness in Britain.             Researchers at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital have studied these Müller glial cells in the human eye and found that some have stem cell properties and are able to develop into a range of different retinal cells, so they could in theory be used for repair.             When tested in rats with diseased retinas, the cells migrated into the retina and took on the characteristics of the surrounding nerve cells. The researchers are now looking at developing this approach for use in the human eye. In addition to growing the cells in the lab and transplanting them back into the eye, the researchers are looking at ways to stimulate growth and persuade the eye to repair itself using its own cells.             'Müller cells with stem cell properties could potentially restore sight to someone who is losing or has lost their sight due to diseased or damaged retina,' says Dr Astrid Limb, who led the study. 'Our findings have enormous potential.'            'It may be possible to store the cells in a cell bank and transplant them into the eye or to use cells from a person’s own eye.'  Using their own cells rather than a donor’s - a so called autologous transplant - has the advantage that their immune system is less likely to reject the treatment.             'We very much hope that we could do autologous transplants within five years,' said Dr Limb.  Autologous transplants, initially on a trial basis, will involve manipulating cells and injecting them back into an individual’s own eye. Eventually, Dr Limb hopes it will also be possible to transfer the cells between different people.              Although Müller glial cells are present in the human eye, it is not clear whether they already automatically repair the retina in some people but not in others.            'Our next step is to identify which factor is responsible for blocking the regeneration,” says Dr Limb. 'Once we know how this mechanism works, we will be much closer to developing a treatment.'             Prof  Peng  Khaw, Director of the new National Institute for Health Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields and the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology commented:          'We urgently need new treatments that give us the hope of restoring vision in people who have lost sight. This is one of the interesting treatments we hope to be developing through to benefit patients in the next few years.'         Anita Lightstone, Head of Corporate Research at the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), said; 'RNIB welcomes the findings of this research, which could potentially lead to a treatment for the leading causes of sight loss in the UK, currently affecting hundreds of thousands of people. However, the research is still in very early stages and any treatments resulting from this are likely to be years away.'           The new work on adult stem cells that can turn to all types of nerve cell in the retina complements other research being undertaken at Moorfields and the Institute of Ophthalmology.             Professor Pete Coffey's group is  trying to turn embryonic stem cells into retinal pigment epithelium, which is a layer of cells above the retina that protect light sensitive cells (photoreceptors) in the eye. These epithelial cells are damaged early during the common eye disease macular degeneration.              Professor Robin Ali's group has identified developmental stages in the mice in which photoreceptor precursor cells are able to migrate and integrate into the retina, also bringing closer the prospect of new treatments for blindness.

telegraph,14/07/2007 00:01,news," A high-profile stem cell research funding body set up by Gordon Brown is facing collapse after the Government failed to provide it with the necessary funds.         Stem cells offer the potential of new treatments for a vast range of conditions such as Parkinson's disease, diabetes and heart disease. Stem cells may one day rebuild tissues, perhaps even organs too, and Britain is well placed to lead the world in this research.         To exploit Britain's liberal regulatory regime and scientific expertise, the UK Stem Cell Foundation was established when Mr Brown, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, accepted all of the recommendations of a Treasury-sponsored report by Sir John Pattison 18 months ago. The report called for a doubling of Government investment, increasing it by between £350 million and £520 million over the following decade. In response, Mr Brown said that Britain 'should be the world's number one centre for genetic and stem cell research'.         The venture capitalist, Sir Christopher Evans, said that the foundation was 'excited to announce our new collaboration with the Medical Research Council and up to £10 million per annum of matching funds. We can now get on and raise more private money'.         The foundation trustees boasted the great and the good from the scientific community including Lord Winston, Lady Archer, Prof Steve Jones, the venture capitalist Jon Moulton and TV presenter Nick Ross. However The Daily Telegraph has found:                      Just £1 million - not the expected £10 million a year - was made available annually in 2006/7 and 2007/8.             The foundation has run out of research money for the 2007/8 financial year - with eight months left to run.            The trustees are planning to meet in the next few weeks to decide whether to wind the body up.             The chief executive and a key consultant have quit in the past eight weeks. Sir Christopher Evans, the businessman caught up in the cash for honours affair, stepped down as a trustee in January.             The Medical Research Council has stepped in to stop the foundation from going bust.                    The problems started because the trustees understood that £10 million of public money would be available from when the foundation was set up. But that does not appear to have been the understanding of officials.         Rather than £10 million a year, just £1 million was made available. The foundation has already spent its budget for up to next April.         The result has been a backlog of funding requests that are going unanswered.         The Medical Research Council has offered to 'peer review' projects for funding the foundation.         Sir Richard Sykes, the chairman of the trustees' board, said: 'The MRC have come in to try to help our situation because otherwise we would go bust and there won't be any money.         'We are in discussions with them about how we can carry on funding the foundation until we can get some funding that will help us go forward. We can keep going on £120,000 a year. We only need funding to April 2008.'         A Medical Research Council spokesman said: 'We expect this to be resolved in the next few weeks.'         A Government spokesman insisted that it would honour its £10 million a year pledge - but not until next year.         'The Government commitment was to provide £1 million per annum through the Medical Research Council in 2006 and 2007 to conduct a pilot of the joint MRC/UKSCF funding mechanism. The Department has confirmed this commitment to the foundation The Government commitment was to provide matched funding of up to £10 million per annum from 2008, following the completion of the trial.'"
telegraph,9/7/2002 0:01,news," A white couple have had black twins after a mix-up at a National Health Service fertility clinic, leading to an unprecedented legal wrangle.The mother is thought to have been mistakenly given sperm or embryos from a black couple, also desperate for a baby. A judge may now have to decide which couple are the twins' parents.Fertility experts said the couples would have attended the clinic on the same day. Investigations have started to see how the error could have occurred.Strict injunctions have banned the publication of any information which could identify the parents, the babies, their biological parentage, the fertility procedures or the hospital trust involved in the mix-up.The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 says the woman who gives birth to the baby is the legal mother. But it covers the careful provisions on the use of donated eggs or sperm and makes no allowance for errors such as this.In a similar case in America, the courts decided that the genetic mother, not the birth mother, was the rightful mother of the baby.A white mother who had received fertility treatment at a clinic in New York gave birth to a black baby as well as a white one when she was given somebody else's embryos as well as her own.Dr Brian Lieberman, the director of reproductive medicine at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, an NHS centre, emphasised that such mistakes were extremely rare. He said: 'There are systems and protocols to avoid errors, but I am afraid that in any system devised by man, mistakes can happen.'Prof Ian Craft, the medical director of the London Fertility Centre, said: 'I am surprised that this has happened after the American case.'This is a very rare event, but it should send a message to every clinic to set up something to make sure it cannot happen again.'Every year more than 27,000 women are treated with IVF procedures, in which an egg is fertilised with sperm in a test tube. These treatments result in about 8,300 babies being born.The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority which regulates fertility treatments and research in Britain, said: 'All clinics that provide treatment involving the use of stored or donated eggs and sperm or embryos created outside the body are licensed by the authority.'The authority regularly inspects clinics to ensure they comply with its code of practice and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.'The British Medical Association said the case meant that the law would have to be looked at again on the question of who the legal parents might be. 'This case is a tragedy for all involved,' a spokesman said. 'It will be a nightmare for the courts.'We think the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority will have to look into this case and patients need reassurance that it will not happen again.'Mohamed Taranissi, the director of the Assisted Reproduction and Gynaecology Centre in London, said: 'To my knowledge, it is the first time this has happened in Britain. Normally, everything done in IVF is double-checked. If two people are looking at it, the chance of a mistake is less likely.'Mr Taranissi suggested three possible explanations for the birth of the black twins: human error; a problem over the use of donor eggs, sperm or embryos; or a skin disorder that could have affected the babies' colouring.He added that while the case was likely to cause some anxiety among people considering IVF, there would still be a demand for treatment. 'It will cause some concern and worries, but I think this is something that individual clinics will have to take up with their patients to clarify what is happening in their given set-up.'The charity Life said it was shocked but 'not surprised' by the error. 'This is a tragedy which may result in a painful and protracted court case,' Peter Garrett, the research and education director, said.'It is now time to stop pretending that everything is fine in the world of IVF. The oft-repeated Government claims that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority is the envy of the world must be seen for what they are.'The reproductive technology revolution is already out of control and this is just the beginning of the disaster. The authority has proved incapable of ensuring that the right sperm matches the right egg. Yet this is the body we are trusting to regulate the new cloning industry in Britain.'"

Just as Copernicus changed our understanding of the solar system, and Earth's place in it, and Darwin's work changed our understanding of evolutionary forces . . . so knowledge of the human genome will change how we see ourselves and our relationship with others.' Professor Steven Rose, Open University 'The genome race has been unseemly and unsavoury and hasn't done the image of science much good . . . Given public concern over genetics in the context of GM food, it behoves scientists to beware of being accused of playing God.' Prof Richard Dawkins, Oxford University 'Along with Bach's music, Shakespeare's sonnets and the Apollo Space Programme, the Human Genome Project is one of those achievements of the human spirit that makes me proud to be human.' Sir Paul Nurse, Director General, Imperial Cancer Research Fund 'It is my belief that this will give rise to new principles, possibly strange and unexpected. Like physics at the turn of the last century, which moved from the common sense world of Newtonian physics, comprehensible to everyday experience, to the strange world of quantum physics - not easily comprehended by the human mind in terms of everyday experience.' Dr Anders Milton, chairman of the World Medical Association 'There is a growing alarm among physicians about the patenting of the human genome because of the potential limitation on the availability of new treatments for patients and on the restrictions this might place on the transfer of knowledge. The WMA is calling on its national medical association members to approach their governments to prevent this from happening.'"
telegraph,1/1/2001 0:01,finance," Edited by Rosie Murray-West  (: 02/08/2001)    Standard spares the jamSTANDARD Chartered is the jam tomorrow bank. No other bank is better positioned to take advantage of booming Asian Pacific economies, and no other bank is on the cusp of so many developing countries.The trouble is that the jam still hasn't materialised. Yesterday chief executive Rana Talwar pointed out that Standard Chartered has a representative office in Iran, and when that market, with its 70m customers, finally opens up, it will be well placed to exploit it.It is impeccable logic, and two years ago Standard Chartered applied such an argument to justify its purchase of Nakornthon Bank in Thailand. Yesterday it reiterated that it was 'well positioned for growth in the medium term' within Thailand, but has yet to break even. When acquisitions are still struggling after two years, they were either ill-advised or wrongly priced to begin with.Standard Chartered yesterday unveiled pre-tax profits up 16pc to $651m (£465m), the first time it has reported in American dollars. However, the bulk of this upturn came from a $69m upsurge in dealing profits. The bank has spent the past three years downplaying the importance of dealing profits within the group, claiming it is striving to improve the quality of its earnings. Yesterday it had a helpful bout of amnesia, and once again extolled the virtues of dealing profits.They may recur next half, but the chances are that they will not. Instead Standard Chartered will have to rely on improving its performance in economies which, by its own admission, look set to have a difficult second half. It is already suffering from the downturn in core markets Singapore and Malaysia, and profits in Hong Kong were flat when compared on a like-for-like basis. ABN Amro estimates that Standard Chartered is standing on 15.5 times its projected full-year earnings of $1.28 billion (£910m), which makes it more expensive than HSBC, a bank operating in similar economies but with a more balanced business flow. The shares look toppy.Bargain off the big boys' radarONE good way to make money is to find shares that big institutions have not noticed because they are too small. These are bound to be under-researched and could be going cheap.One such is Huntsworth, a struggling PR outfit which Lord Chadlington, the Tory PR man, and Jon Foulds, former Halifax chairman, bought 30pc of last summer. They are steadily transforming the company, which lost £6.5m last year, including £3.3m of exceptionals. Yesterday they snapped up a regional PR business called Harrison Cowley for £6.5m, plus another £2.5m in possible earnout payments.It was also an amazingly good price. Harrison Cowley has been valued at about seven times pre-tax profits of £900,000. And only £300,000 is payable in cash, the rest is in Huntsworth shares. To put that in perspective, larger quoted media agencies usually trade at 20-30 times earnings. Elsewhere in the sector, Tempus, a media buying agency, is currently under offer from Havas of France at £425m in cash, and is being valued at 35 times earnings.There is still a lot of work to do in transforming Huntsworth, which is one reason why the shares barely moved yesterday, closing up 1.5p at 31.5p. But a new house broker is being signed up soon - which means some research will at last be published - and there are hopes of good news on current trading with the interims in September.David Heal, the owner of Harrison Cowley, will be paid any earnout in shares, which, for the purposes of the calculation, have been valued at 40p. He obviously thinks Huntsworth's share price should head that way soon. Fans of smaller stocks should buy now before the big boys notice.The gene genie is out of the bottleTHE technology slump has not just hit manufacturers of mobile phones, semiconductors and computers. The biotechnology industry, which is developing the next generation of whizzy pharmaceuticals, has been affected as well.Companies such as Oxford Biomedica, which reported six-month figures yesterday, rose to crazy heights on the back of the human genome project, only to fall back as investors reassessed the risks. Neither the rise nor the tumbles were entirely justified. Oxford Biomedica is a leader in gene therapy, and managed a successful fundraising in choppy markets.It has some good products, the most advanced being MetXia, which is designed to enhance a cancer remedy now on the market. It is in Phase I/II clinical trials.Yesterday's six-month figures were in line with expectations. The company posted an increased loss of £3.6m, compared with £2.6m last year, for the six months to June 30. Turnover was flat at £0.3m.The increased losses were expected. Oxford Biomedica has stepped up investment, setting up a business in the States.The problem with Biomedica is that everything is at such an early stage. Gene therapy is a technology of the future and the company is not predicted to break even for several years.When gene therapy does make it big, Biomedica will be in a very good position, but it is going to be a very long time. The shares, up 3.5 yesterday at 33.5p, are well off their year high of 84p. However, this is only for those with a seriously long-term view. Watch out for a bumpy ride."
telegraph,3/1/2003 0:01,news," Stem cells found in human umbilical cord blood can be stored and successfully used for a range of treatments for much longer than thought.Cells frozen for 15 years can be as viable as fresh cells, according to a study published today that underlines the long-term value of more than 100,000 such samples stored around the world.Dr Hal Broxmeyer of Indiana University and colleagues tested stem cells in 15-year-old samples. They report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the majority of stem cells in each sample survived thawing and were able to reproduce and form colonies outside the body and be used for transplants.The results suggest that stem cells may remain frozen and be useful far past the three-to-five year window currently considered optimal.Cord blood stem cells are sometimes frozen in anticipation of a patient's future need to treat childhood cancers, immune system disorders and genetic diseases. Until recently, no one knew how long the cells could remain frozen and still be useful."
telegraph,3/10/2002 0:01,news," The first complete genetic analysis of the malaria parasite and the mosquito that transmits it to humans are published today. The work marks a turning point in the fight against one of humanity's greatest scourges.An international consortium of 150 researchers deciphered the genetic code of the parasite that infects half a billion people each year, killing three million.The sequence of 24 million genetic 'letters' is the recipe of Plasmodium falciparum, taken from a Dutch schoolgirl who contracted the disease almost 25 years ago.It is published today in the journal Nature after six years of effort by a team including the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, and the Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, Maryland, USA.In tomorrow's issue of the journal Science, another international team of more than 100 researchers led by Dr Robert Holt, of Celera, Rockville, publishes the sequence of 278 million letters that makes up the recipe of the Anopheles gambiae mosquito, which transmits the parasite as it drinks human blood.Along with the draft human genome, published last year, researchers now have a detailed insight into the DNA, or 'book of life', of the three components in the malaria life cycle.This will be crucial for developing new drugs, vaccines, repellents, insecticides and GM insects resistant to the disease.Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, said the 'potential major breakthrough' could help developing countries 'break free of the shackles of this devastating disease'.Malaria drugs and insecticides are failing because of resistance and there is no immediate prospect of a vaccine.However, Prof Brian Greenwood, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'The new information opens up new approaches to the development of drugs, vaccines, insecticides and insect repellents.'Prof Andrea Crisanti, who led a team that produced the first GM mosquito, said the announcements were akin to providing 'a route map to someone who is hopelessly lost. Now we can see where we are and where we can go.'But the battle against malaria is far from over. To exploit these genomes to control the disease will take money and commitment from drug companies and governments, said Prof Robert Sinden, of Imperial College London.Prof Fotis Kafatos, the director general of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory who helped analyse genes in the immune system of the mosquito, said the work was the 'end of a beginning'.But others are more sceptical. Prof Chris Curtis, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'I have a feeling that projects on the genome are done because molecular biologists think they can be done and are exciting to do. The justifications are added on afterwards.' Prof Curtis also pointed to the limitations facing 'governments with health budgets of $5 per head per year for all diseases'.Another expert was more blunt and told Nature: 'If more money were spent on developing existing vaccine candidates rather than hyping the genome, I think lives would be saved sooner.'Plasmodium falciparum is the first complex parasite for which scientists have a complete genome.Today's study reveals that it contains genes appropriated from plants millions of years ago, said Dr Neil Hall, who led a 50 strong team at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,.He said the parasite has an 'apicoplast', the remains of an ancient chloroplast, the light-gathering organ of plants, absorbed when 'the ancestor of all malaria parasites ate an alga'. Most of the enzymes identified in Plasmodium that have no counterparts in humans - and thus promise to be good targets for drugs - have been found in the apicoplast.Some thought that the £18.5 million parasite project would never be finished. 'Parts of the DNA are very unstable, which means some pieces just fell to bits when you tried to work with them,' said Dr Hall. He likened the effort to 'tearing up half a dozen Bibles, scattering the pieces over a playing field then trying to put them together again'.As for the work on the mosquito, Dr Holt said it would have immediate benefits in 'understanding the molecular basis of resistance to insecticides.'Dr Carlos Morel, director of the UNDP-World Bank-WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, said the work marked 'an extraordinary moment in the history of science'. He said: 'At last, the enormous power of modern technology is penetrating the mysteries of an ancient disease which continues to kill millions.'"
telegraph,4/7/2015 16:00,finance,"$45bn bid by Monsanto, the world’s largest seed maker by sales, for Syngenta, the biggest producer of crop pesticides and chemicals Is Monsanto the world’s most evil company? Its detractors certainly think so. On its way to becoming the world’s biggest seed-maker and supplier of crop chemicals, the American giant seems to have upset a lot of people.  And now, with its attempts to take over Syngenta, a Swiss rival, the St Louis-based agrochemical producer has generated fresh controversy among critics.  The face of this divisive corporation is Hugh Grant, a 57-year-old Scot who has been with Monsanto for more than three decades and at the helm for the last nine years.   Hugh Grant, chief executive of Monsanto  Grant has proposed a complex merger with Syngenta which would unlock billions in tax savings for shareholders by shifting the combined company’s headquarters to the UK.  This type of tax-driven takeover, known as a corporate “inversion”, soared last year as many companies rushed to beat an anticipated clampdown by the Obama administration.  Yet, it isn’t Monsanto’s attempts at tax avoidance that has sparked the greatest concern. The US company is already the world’s largest seed-maker by sales while Syngenta is the biggest producer of crop pesticides and chemicals. The $45bn tie-up would create a new agricultural titan with a disproportionate grip on the farming industry and the global food chain.  Today, Monsanto, for many opponents, represents all that is wrong with the modern food industry, a dystopian mix of industrial agriculture and biotechnology. However, the company’s controversial practices stretch back nearly 100 years to its previous incarnation as a producer of industrial chemicals, some of which – such as saccharine, aspartame, and dioxin, the primary poison found in Agent Orange – are among the most contentious potions ever concocted.  Monsanto moved away from chemicals into seed production and biotechnology in the 1980s and ultimately reinvented itself as an agricultural company, a move that opened the door to a wave of fresh controversy when it produced the world’s first genetically modified crop.  In 1996, the US giant invented a soybean resistant to glyphosate – the active ingredient in its “Roundup” weedkiller, the best-selling herbicide on the planet. The bean had been approved by the US Department of Agriculture but when Monsanto tried to introduce it to Europe, it grossly underestimated public concerns over genetically modified food.   Although there has never been any compelling evidence to suggest that genetically modified crops are any more harmful than conventionally grown food, the company found itself at the centre of an almighty public backlash. In the UK, where mad cow disease had led to heightened anxiety about modern farming, the storm over GM products was particularly fierce and a rebellion ensued. Big high-street chains including Marks & Spencer refused to stock GM foods, campaigners such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth accused Monsanto of trying to sneak ingredients into people’s mouths, and the British tabloids printed stories about “Frankenfoods” and “mutant crops”. Even Prince Charles described genetic engineering as akin to playing God.  Speaking to The Independent earlier this year, Grant conceded that Monsanto had misread public sentiment over GM technology when it was introduced two decades ago.  The company had made “the wrong call” by failing to rebrand itself in the aftermath of the botched launch of GM in Europe and had suffered as a result, he said.  Understandably for a company of Monsanto’s size and scale, it has sometimes found itself at loggerheads with the farming industry. The company’s advances in genetic engineering help farmers produce bigger crops of everything from corn to soybeans, potatoes and squash, varieties that are often resistant to herbicides, insects and drought. But some farmers complain these benefits come with high costs, including strict rules about how Monsanto’s products can and can’t be used, sometimes resulting in lawsuits against customers who fall foul of the company’s policies.  Now, there are growing concerns that a merger with Syngenta, a big competitor, will push up prices of seeds and pesticides even further.  Yet, perhaps the biggest obstacle to a deal between the two is Syngenta itself, which has emphatically rejected Monsanto’s overtures on the basis that its offer is too low.  Grant is unlikely to be deterred, maintaining a fervent belief in the role that companies like Monsanto must play in feeding the world’s growing population. “When you go from six to nine billion over the next 30 to 40 years there is no new land,” he told The Independent. “Can you do it without biotech? I don’t think so.” "

In what is seen by many as a U-turn, the Government published a draft bill that effectively sweeps away last year's ban, which was widely criticised by scientists, who warned that it would hinder medical breakthroughs.          Under the Human Tissue and Embryos Bill,   scientists will be allowed to produce 'cybrid' embryos that are 99.9 per cent human and 0.1 per  cent animal and they will be permitted to alter human embryos by the introduction of animal DNA.         Under the legislation proposed today, hybrid embryos would only be allowed for research into serious diseases, and scientists working with them would require a licence.         Teams of researchers based in London and Newcastle have applied for permission to create cybrid embryos to produce embryonic stem cells - the body's building blocks that grow into all other types of cells.         They want to use the stem cells to understand and provide new treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cystic fibrosis, motor neurone disease and Huntington's.         Speaking at a briefing at the Department of Health in London, Caroline  Flint, the health minister, said the debate had moved on in the last few months, making the scientific issues clearer.          She said: 'I honestly don't see this as a back flip... it was an evaluation of a number of different view points.          'Our position was not to stop this research but to be clear that it's sensitive research, and we have to be sure about what we're going to permit to happen in the future.          'The position was a general prohibition, but with the opportunity on a case-by-case basis for certain types of research to take place'. "

The success of the Harry Potter books - the final novel in the series sold 11 million copies in its first 24 hours - has united a generation of children and parents in a genuine love of reading.         The judges felt Miss Rowling had transformed the world's view of Britain and that her books are 'brilliantly British'. That she also managed to top the best-seller list in France with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the first English-language author to do so, is a further testament to her global appeal.         Rowling has left an indelible mark on the nation's literary history, which is why the judges insisted that she should receive double honours, winning the arts category and be named the Morgan Stanley Overall Great Briton of 2007.

His pioneering work on mouse teratocarcinoma stem cells in tissue culture systems led to the discovery of embryonic stem cells. Sir Martin's laboratory also produced the first demonstration of gene therapy to address cystic fibrosis in a whole animal. Not surprisingly, the Cardiff-based scientist was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine last year.         In naming him as winner of the science and innovation category, the judges praised him as a man whose work had a 'massive impact on Britain' and who had brought 'science into government'.                      Creative industries winner: Jonathan Ive                                                Described as a 'rock star in the technology world' by the judges, Jonathan Ive is the design genius behind the iconic iMac, iPod and iPhone. Mr Ive, senior vice-president of industrial design at Apple, joined the company in 1992 when it was at its lowest ebb. Since then he has helped Steve Jobs, boss of Apple, make the firm a byword for creativity and innovation.         The launch of the iPhone in 2007 was another triumph for Mr Ive as the new handset captured the imagination of the planet. The way he has transformed Apple's technology into must-have consumer items left the judges little option but to name him the Creative Industries Great Briton.                     Sports winner: Lewis Hamilton                                                 Quite simply, Lewis Hamilton is the hottest property in British sport and many were surprised when he missed out on winning the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year before Christmas.         He came agonisingly close to landing the Formula One motor racing title in his debut year, capturing the nation's imagination and attracting fans with previously little interest in motor sport, as well as traditional 'petrol-heads'. The judges said that Hamilton, the former British kart champion, had behaved with 'impeccable composure' and was an 'inspirational role model for young people'.         His achievements so early in his career left the judges no option but to select him as the sport category winner. This is surely not the last honour this brilliant young Briton will receive in what promises to be a glittering career.                      Environment winner: Tim Smit                                                Tim Smit landed the inaugural environment award after the judges decided that the co-founder of the Eden Project in Cornwall had made a major contribution to environmental matters in 2007.         The Eden Project has attracted more than nine million visitors since it opened and is dedicated to promoting our understanding of human dependence on plants. In October, the project was named the best British building of the past 20 years at the British Construction Industry Awards and the judges decided a man with Mr Smit's vision deserved yet another accolade.                      Campaigning & public life winner: Shami Chakrabarti                                                As director of Liberty, the civil rights pressure group, Shami Chakrabarti is at the heart of the campaign to defend fundamental human rights and freedoms in England and Wales. The former Home Office barrister was praised by the judges for the 'amazing style' which she brings to campaigning in an often testing political climate.         Miss Chakrabarti is a prominent opponent of proposals to extend detention periods and introduce ID cards. The judges felt that she deserved the campaigning and public life award for her tireless efforts to keep civil liberties never far from the top of the political agenda.                     Business winner: Sir John Rose                                                A brilliant British businessman running a great British brand, Sir John Rose is the driving force behind Rolls-Royce. As chief executive, his strategy to provide 'power by the hour' has enabled Rolls-Royce to transform itself into a company in which services account for more than half of group revenues.         In a fiercely competitive market, Sir John has delivered British engines to aircraft across the globe, often beating American rivals GE.         The judges felt that the turnaround in Rolls-Royce's fortunes was largely down to Sir John's immense passion and his belief in British engineering. "

More than 500,000 people in the UK have irreversible blindness caused by macular degeneration.         The disease is marked by a progressive loss of central vision due to degeneration of the macula - a pigmented spot at the back of the retina.         Now an anonymous American philanthropist, who saw his father go blind, has given a London-led team almost £4 million towards the cost of developing a stem cell therapy, where eye cells from an embryo are used to restore sight.          Prof Pete Coffey and Lyndon da Cruz, an eye surgeon, of the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, have teamed up with Prof Peter Andrews, of the University of Sheffield, to conduct trials.         Mr da Cruz said yesterday: ''Given age- related macular degeneration could affect up to one third of the population by 2070 the potential to create a treatment strategy for this condition is critical and may have a major impact on vision loss in the community.''         The team estimates the stem cell implants could start within five years and eventually become a routine, 45-minute operation.          Prof Coffey said: 'If it hasn't become routine in about 10 years it would mean we haven't succeeded. It has to be something that's available to large numbers of people.'         As a trial run for the operations, the team has repaired the vision of patients with macular degeneration with tissue from their own eyes, moving it from the region of the eye responsible for peripheral vision to the macula.         The treatment is not initially aimed at the transparent skin of nerve cells that detect light but at an underlying carpet of cells called the retinal pigment epithelium, or RPE.         RPE was transplanted by surgeons, without the use of stem cells in an experimental procedure on 12 patients at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, using RPE taken from another site in their own retina.          However, replacing RPE in what are long, complex operations is of limited benefit in treating common eye diseases such as macular degeneration.         Mr Da Cruz, having transplanted and moved tissue in the eye, has seen more than 25 per cent of patients reporting an improvement in what is otherwise an untreatable disease, demonstrating that cell transplants work in principle.         From stem cells taken from early human embryos, Prof Coffey has found a way to turn them into RPE cells by adding growth factors. The team has successfully tested this method on rats.         Prof Alistair Fielder, senior medical adviser for the eye research charity Fight for Sight, said the project 'represents a real chance to tackle this untreatable condition and bring hope to many'."
telegraph,1/3/2007 0:01,news,"            A discovery has challenged the accepted account of how our skin renewsand could shed light on the development of cancers, says Roger Highfield                   The textbook account of our skin constantly renews itself with the helpof stem cells will have to be torn up in the light of a study of micetails.          Around the world, scientists are studying whether stem cells canregenerate tissues because they are parent cells that are thought to beresponsible for the more than 200 types of different cell in the bodyand are also at the focus of studies of cancer research, since they arethought to be particularly long lived and thus at higher risk of DNAdamage.          Household dust shows how every day we shed the outermost layer of ourskin and replace it from within with new skin cells.  Stem cells werethought to seed the growth of new skin but, by tracking cells as theydivided in mice tails over a year, a Cambridge University team hasoverturned this.          Previously, it was thought that it was the adult stem cells thatrefresh  skin that sloughs off. But the new insight from the  MRC CancerCell Unit in Cambridge suggests that healthy skin maintains itself onits own.          Most cells in the body expand by doubling, producing two daughtercells, then 4, 8 and so on as they grow. But Dr Philip Jones who led theresearch published in the journal Nature,  explained: 'We found that thecells followed a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 growth model, which was very surprising.'           The adult stem cells, which are relatively rare, don't seem to doanything in normal skin, being there help repair and replace injured orburnt skin, he said.          And, as a consequence of ordinary cells being involved in skinregeneration, any of these more plentiful skin cells can, if its DNA isdamaged, be responsible for cancer. 'One of the implications of this isthat these progenitor skin cells can also potentially go bad and causeskin cancer if they linger long enough,' he said.          Being able to track skin cells in the actual animals at the cellularlevel over a year has allowed the scientists to develop mathematicalmodels for predicting confidently what happens to skin long-term for thefirst time.  'Our ultimate goal though is to be able to model theevolution of cancer from the single cell stage onwards so we can findbetter ways to tackling the disease. By using the right gene to labelthe cells, this might just be possible.' said Dr Jones, who is nowconfirming the results with studies of human skin.

telegraph,23/11/2006 00:01,news,"            A new dimension to genetic variation has been documented, one with far reaching implications for studies of disease and evolution, reports Roger Highfield                  Every single person is different but scientists now admit that, at the level of our DNA, we vary much more than they had ever suspected, a discovery that will change the way they think about hereditary diseases and human evolution.          We always knew that we each had our own, individual DNA, or copy of 'The Book of Life', where the spellings of our genetic code differed ever so slightly. But new studies show that it's not only single letters but sentences, paragraphs, and even whole pages that can be missing, shuffled or duplicated.         In short, scientists have stumbled on a complex, higher-order architecture in the human genetic code, or human genome, which has already been found to influence Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, susceptibility to the Aids virus, forms of colour blindness and schizophrenia.         Genes usually occur in two copies, one inherited from each parent and current dogma has been that people are 99.9 per cent the same at the level of the DNA, the language of genes. But now scientists find bigger chunks have been duplicated - at least 10 percent of genes in the human population can vary in the number of copies of DNA sequences they contain, revealing people differ much more than thought, also placing a greater genetic distance between them and their closest relatives, the apes.         The team found approximately 2,900 genes—more than 10 percent of human genes —with variations in the number of copies of specific DNA segments. These differences can sometimes influence the proteins made in the body and the findings 'will change forever the field of human genetics,' commented Prof James Lupski, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.         The discovery has come from the use of a gene chip technology able to study bigger DNA differences, which may have been overlooked because DNA reading technology can only read a few hundred letters of code at a time, so when genomes were assembled it was not always realised that apparent duplications of chunks of DNA were real and not errors, as many once thought.         Until now, most studies have focused on single-letter differences (called single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) between individuals that are responsible for diseases such as haemophilia. Now they are able to track larger regions of the order of one thousand letters that are absent from, or duplicated in different individuals - what are called copy number variations (CNV), a new vista of genetic variation – with dramatic implications for disease studies – has been revealed in four studies, published in Nature, Nature Genetics and Genome Research.         The teams analysed DNA from 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in Europe, Africa or Asia. In all, the scientists identified 1,447 different CNVs that collectively covered about 12 percent of the human genome and six to 19 percent of any given chromosome—far more widespread than previously thought.          'Each one of us has a unique pattern of gains and losses of complete sections of DNA,' said Dr Matthew Hurles, one of the project's leaders at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, near Cambridge, 'and one of the real surprises of these results was just how much of our DNA varies in copy number. The copy number variation that researchers had seen before was simply the tip of the iceberg, while the bulk lay submerged, undetected.'         The new map will change the way in which scientists search for genes involved in disease. One striking example is resistance to infection by HIV, which is determined in part by multiple copies of the gene CCL3L1, a variation that is essentially invisible to the traditional methods that focus on single spelling mistakes.         Copy number variation is the result of several different mechanisms, some of which remain poorly understood. However, as a result of our recent common origin in Africa, the vast majority of copy-number variation – around 89% – is shared among the diverse human populations studied.          As a corollary, 11 per cent accounts for the differences between populations, said Dr Hurles. Striking differences in regions of our genome between different continental populations will define variants that have allowed different populations to adapt to their different environments. One example is the strikingly increased copy number of the HIV-related CCL3L1 gene in African populations, one which predates the emergence of Aids.          An understanding of how genetic variation is distributed among populations not only tells us about human prehistory but also improves our ability to find disease genes, added Dr Nigel Carter, another of the project's leaders at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. 'In particular, we feel they may have a role in the diseases of old age.'         'Many examples of diseases resulting from changes in copy number are emerging,' added Charles Lee, one of the project's leaders from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, US. Of the approximately 3,000 genes that vary in copy number from their predicted two copies 285 are already known to be associated with disease, and copy number variations of some of these genes have been or are now being speculated as risk factors for other ailments such as inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, cataracts, arterial disease and schizophrenia. 'A recent review lists 17 conditions of the nervous system alone – including Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer Disease – that can result from such copy number changes,' he added.         Genes that are involved in the immune system and in brain development and activity – two functions that have evolved rapidly in humans – tend to be enriched in CNVs. By contrast, genes that play a role in early development and some genes involved in cell division – both critical to fundamental biology – tend to be spared. In Nature, Prof Huntington Willard of Duke University, North Carolina, writes, 'the stage is set for global studies to explore anew…the clinical significance of human variation.' "
telegraph,13/01/2008 11:01,news,"            Breakthrough which marks the creation of the first living artificial heart could signal the beginning of the end of organ shortages, reports Roger Highfield                        Doctors have stripped down and refurbished a dead heart so that it can beat again, an unprecedented feat that could signal the beginning of the end of organ shortages..                                                      How to grow a heart                                                                        Organs to be taken without consent                                                                        Bishop speaks out against Brown's organ donation plan                                               The revolutionary research could overcome the shortage of replacement hearts and other organs, and do away with the need for antirejection drugs, according to an American team.             The world's first beating, retooled 'bioartificial heart' is described today in the journal Nature Medicine by University of Minnesota researchers in research that could pave the way to a new treatment for the 22 million people worldwide who live with heart failure.             The team took a whole heart and removed cells from it. Then, with the resulting architecture, chambers, valves and the blood vessel structure intact, repopulated the structure with new cells.          'We just took nature's own building blocks to build a new organ,' says Dr Harald Ott, a co-investigator who now works at Massachusetts General Hospital. 'When we saw the first contractions we were speechless.'          The work has huge implications: 'The idea would be to develop transplantable blood vessels or whole organs that are made from your own cells,' said Prof Doris Taylor, director of the Centre for Cardiovascular Repair, Minnesota, principal investigator.          The method could be used to grow liver, kidney, lung and pancreas, indeed virtually any organ with a blood supply.          She tells The Daily Telegraph that although 'years away' from using the method in hospitals, she is ready to grow a human heart, though costs make it prohibitive at present.          'We could begin with human cells and pig or human scaffold now but creating the larger bioreactors (the vessels in which the organs are grown) and generating the reagents and growing enough cells would cost tens of thousands of dollars for each heart at this point.         'That is just too expensive to answer basic questions. We of course want to move in that direction, but funding is limited. As we can we will go forward - perhaps one heart at a time. '          In general, the supply of donor organs is limited and once a heart is transplanted, individuals face life-long immunosuppression, where drugs are used to prevent rejection, often trading heart failure for high blood pressure, diabetes, and kidney failure over the long term..          Because a new heart created by decellularization could be filled with the recipient's own stem cells the researchers believe it's much less likely to be rejected by the body.          And once placed in the recipient, in theory the heart would be nourished, regulated, and regenerated similar to the heart that it replaced.          'We used immature heart cells in this version, as a proof of concept. We pretty much figured heart cells in a heart matrix had to work,' Prof Taylor says. 'Going forward, our goal is to use a patient's stem cells to build a new heart.'          As for the source of the cells from a heart patient, she says: 'From muscle, bone marrow, or heart; depending on where the science leads us.'          Although heart repair was the initial goal, decellularization shows potential to change how scientists think about engineering any organ, she says. 'It opens a door to this notion that you can make any organ: kidney, liver, lung, pancreas - you name it and we hope we can make it.'          UK Transplant comments that 155 people had their lives saved or transformed by a heart transplant last year, though 28 died while on the waiting list. Currently, 81 people are waiting for heart transplant.          Nationally, more than 9,000 people need a transplant, yet typically only around 3,000 are performed every year. Last year 1,000 people died needing a transplant. A UK Transplant spokesman says: 'These developments offer long term hope and long may they continue but the real problem now is a desperate shortage of donated hearts.'          Dr Tim Chico, Consultant Cardiologist, University of Sheffield, says: 'This is an ingenious step towards solving a massive problem. Heart failure (an inability of the heart to pump sufficient blood, usually after a heart attack) is increasing in the UK.          'A chronic shortage of donors for heart transplantation makes stem cell therapy appealing. The study is very preliminary, but it does show that stem cells can regrow in the 'skeleton' of a donor heart. However, it will take a lot of further work to assess whether this will ever be a viable option for patients.'         'This very exciting study,' comments Dr Jon Frampton, University of Birmingham. 'Although this is only a first step requiring considerable follow-up development, the study nevertheless represents an exciting breakthrough that will eventually make the prospect of repairing damaged hearts a reality and will also be an approach that can be extended to other organs.'          Prof Wayne Morrison, Director of the Bernard O'Brien Institute of Microsurgery, Melbourne, comments: 'This is the first time a whole organ has been tissue engineered outside the body.          'They have demonstrated that they can create a heart that looks like a heart and is shaped like a heart and, most excitingly, that they can re-establish the blood vessels that were originally there. It is this 'regrowth' of the blood vessel cells that gives the potential in the future to connect this structure to a blood vessel in the body and then get circulation to go through it.          Dr Anita Thomas at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, University of Queensland, adds: 'There is one more major step to achieve before we can proceed any further: we need to see what happens when these artificial hearts are placed in a recipient animal for any length of time. The authors of the article have the necessary skills and yet have not reported their results. We wait with anticipation for their next publication.'         How to grow a heart         While there have been advances in growing heart tissue in the lab, the problem has been how to create a 3D scaffold that mimics the complex architecture and intricacies of the body's primary pump.          That is why Prof Doris Taylor and her colleagues resorted to 'decellularization' - removing all of the cells from an organ with detergent - in this case an animal cadaver heart - leaving only the extracellular matrix, the framework between the cells, intact, along with the plumbing and heart valves.          After successfully removing all of the cells from both rat and pig hearts, the researchers injected rat hearts with a mixture of immature cells that came from newborn rat hearts and placed the structure in a sterile chamber in the lab to grow.          The results were very promising, Prof Taylor said. Four days after seeding the decellularized heart scaffolds with cells, contractions were observed. Eight days later, the hearts were pumping, albeit at only two per cent of the efficiency of an adult heart.          A study at of the hearts at the cellular level revealed that the 'cells have many of the markers we associate with the heart and seem to know how to behave like heart tissue.'"
telegraph,6/10/2007 0:01,technology,"            DNA fingerprinting could turn the titan of web-searching into a medical behemoth, says Emma Hartley                   As if gauging the nation's receptiveness to new technology, Lord Justice Sedley suggested recently that the UK's whole population and its visitors should have their DNA added to a Home Office database that already holds genetic information about four million people – five per cent of the UK population, and the highest proportion of any state in the world.         Sedley is known for his progressive views and has a record on the bench of upholding civil liberties, so this was electrifying stuff. Not only would the measure confer obvious advantages on the police, while getting around the objection by civil libertarians that ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented on the database, it also promised a practical use for a technology so new that the four million sets of data were collected before most of us even knew it was happening.         Ever since the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, in which the first whole set of 23 human chromosomes was decoded into its constituent bases, scientists and biotech businesses have been agog at the possibilities. Spotting an opportunity, a group of new companies has begun offering to 'mine' your genes for information about your ancestors.          One is Oxford Ancestors (oxfordancestors.com), started by Prof Brian Sykes of Oxford University, which will tell you from which of 36 geographically located 'tribes' your ancestors originated, all for £180. Cambridge University offers a similar service for £30 less.         But the decoding of the human genome promises much more – just ask a geneticist. An entire history of life on Earth is buried within the cells of our bodies if you possess the skill to interpret it, as is information about our collective longevity, degeneration and ultimate demise. The big question, though, is 'What does it mean for me?' And are we prepared to pay to find out?         Ever alert to the next big thing, Google recently bought a $3.9 million (£2 million) minority stake in a Californian company called 23andme (23andme.com), among whose founders was Anne Wojcicki, who married Sergey Brin – one of Google's co-founding geeks – earlier this year.          This marriage is the stuff of Silicon Valley legend, since Ms Wojcicki's sister rented out her garage to the 'Google guys' when they left Stanford University to pursue their start-up. But this is not a story about nepotism.         What 23andme will apparently be offering when it launches later this year is a personalised service that will let individuals have their DNA read and the information stored, so that when medical and theoretical advances relevant to them are achieved, they will be notified. Many people think of Google simply as a really fast search engine, but its stated mission has long been to organise all the information in the world: see David A Vise's book The Google Story (2005) for more on this.          So its interest in the human genome is a natural extension of its original goal, with the extra spice that computing and genetics are both industries growing exponentially. When you take into consideration Google's unparalleled server power, the tie-up between the two companies could represent a historic breakthrough in personalised medicine.         Information about one's susceptibility to specific diseases, vulnerability to the side-effects of existing medicines and suitability for new ones coming on to the market could all be gleaned from this kind of genetic mapping.          In June, for instance, a paper was published by the Wellcome Trust confirming that they had identified the genetic pathways of seven human diseases: bipolar disorder, coronary artery disease, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and Type 1 and 2 diabetes. This opened up the field for more accurate treatments.         British companies are directly involved in this burgeoning industry. Researching this article, I was advised that one of the best people to talk to in the UK would be Dr Shankar Balasubramanian.          Yet trying to get hold of him, the apologetic message was returned that he would be unable to speak to me because a company he had founded in Cambridge, called Solexa, was bought out by an American company called Illumina for $600 million in November last year and, since Illumina (and therefore he) was involved in the 23andme deal, his hands were tied until the launch.         Dr Richard Durbin of the Welcome Foundation's Sanger Institute in Cambridge was on Solexa's scientific advisory board and explained that until now, the main obstacle to personalised medicine has been money.          'Each person's DNA is 3,000 million bases long and decoding the whole lot costs around $10 million. But the technology Solexa was developing is known as high speed genome sequencing and it's bringing the cost down very considerably. There are currently three companies using it that I'm aware of: Illumina, Roche and Applied Biosystems. But in reality there is no commercial demand for sequencing an entire genome.         'There are only 12 million positions on our DNA that differ from each other – the rest are the same in everyone. It is these 12 million that make us individuals and decoding this, in a process called genotyping, currently costs about $1,000. The technology is developing so fast that very soon it will drop to the low hundreds of dollars.'         The Home Office's DNA fingerprint uses only 10 discreet areas of a chromosome, costs less than £100 per print and has a theoretical chance of one in a billion of being wrong, although this was undermined by recent Home Office confirmation that around 550,000 false or wrongly spelled names had been submitted with DNA samples by the police, making them of little practical use in court.         There are ethical considerations, of course. Genes can be switched on and off, so telling someone that they have a predisposition to cancer, for instance, would surely have to be accompanied by advice on how to minimise the risk of developing it.          There is also the issue of what happens to the stored DNA data, since any company holding such information (the decoded DNA and the identity of the person involved, to discover how those genes are expressing themselves) would possess a goldmine of information for the pharmaceutical industry.         The cost and availability of treatments would be a further ethical sting in the tail. But it is hard to resist the thought that such a service will find a mass market. Can you imagine the conversation that would ensue at a dinner party of genetically decoded hypochondriacs?"
telegraph,27/04/2006 00:01,news,"            Gene transplants that have been successfully used to treat children with a serious hereditary disease may be riskier than thought.          A young boy has already died of leukaemia in a French gene therapy trial involving the hereditary immune disorder X-SCID. He was one of three boys who had a cancer-causing gene activated by the transplant.          X-SCID - known as the 'bubble boy' syndrome because sufferers have to be protected from infection - is caused by mutations in a gene called IL2RG, which is responsible for a protein that helps to direct the growth of immune cells.           In gene therapy, a normal version of the gene is introduced into the body. But today, in the journal Nature, studies on mice conducted at the Salk Institute in California by Prof Inder Verma reveal that the replacement gene can promote cancer.          A colleague, Dr Niels-Bjarne Woods, followed mice treated with the IL2RG gene and found that one third developed blood cancer. Dr Woods said: 'Curing X-SCID by replacing IL2RG in the manner it is currently being done puts patients at an increased risk of developing cancer.'          Prof Adrian Thrasher, who has successfully treated eight boys with the gene at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, said that the findings were overstated. 'On the basis of the data that is published, which is very preliminary, it is quite possible that the effects are caused by the artificially high levels of the gene in the animals. Certainly we and our colleagues have found no evidence for this effect.'          Recently, two young men who had their ability to fight infection stripped by another hereditary disease - Chronic Granulomatous Disorder, or CGD - have been successfully treated with gene transplants by Prof Thrasher and colleagues in Switzerland and Germany. Both men managed to clear infections that had previously not responded.          The new work once again shows that gene therapy can cause genetic damage to make cells multiply. Insertion of the new gene seemed to activate four separate genes, which led to an expansion of the corrected cells by up to four times.          This helps make the gene therapy more effective, leading to more cells with the correct genes, according to Prof Thrasher. 'What we don't know is whether it is dangerous, though there is no evidence of this so far.'           Debbie Stewart, 33, who lives near Glasgow and has a six-year-old son, Mark, with CGD, says that gene therapy offers 'a light at the end of the tunnel'."
telegraph,18/04/2004 00:01,education,"            Headlines in Britain last week claimed that genetically modified crops were proving disastrous in South America - but local farmers say they have transformed their lives                  Ricardo Martinez smiled with pride as he looked over the thriving fields of genetically modified soya and then denounced critics who claimed last week that such crops had been a 'disaster' for his country, Argentina.          'Back in the 1980s we had a lot of trouble with flooding, soil erosion and ever-present weeds,' said Mr Martinez, who has been growing soya for seven years on his 3,200-acre farm 190 miles from the capital, Buenos Aires.          'When Monsanto introduced GM soya to Argentina it was something of a miracle. It allowed us to increase production and manage our land far more effectively,' he added, stressing that the crop had been of 'huge benefit' to Argentina's economy.          Mr Martinez's remarks were prompted by an article in New Scientist magazine claiming that the introduction of GM crops in Argentina was proving an economic and environmental failure. The article, published in Britain last week, made national headlines when it said that Argentina's pioneering use of GM soya since 1997 had caused 'superweeds' to overrun the country and had led to health problems.          The claims have prompted an angry reaction in the South American country, where GM crops have been embraced enthusiastically. Argenbio, Argentina's council for biotechnology, led the protests, arguing that GM soya had enabled farmers to avoid a cocktail of chemicals that threatened the crop and, in some cases, damaged the health of farm workers and livestock, causing skin rashes and respiratory problems.          GM soya is engineered to be resistant to the herbicide glyphosate, so that farmers can use just that one product to control weeds without damaging their crops. 'That combination of glyphosate and GM soya was a godsend to us,' Mr Martinez said.          Glyphosate also takes less time to sink into the soil than the mix of chemicals used before, reducing the risk of its presence when the product is consumed.          Since GM soya's introduction in 1996 its production in Argentina has grown by almost 75 per cent, while more traditional crops such as rice, maize and wheat have shown a steady decline. Today, 99 per cent of soya grown in Argentina is genetically modified and farmers cultivate 85.5 million acres of it.          New Scientist quoted experts who warned that GM crops could destroy the soil's natural micro-organisms and create 'superweeds' - undesirable plants that mutate to be as resistant to herbicides as the main crop.          Small farmers blamed glyphosate for crop failure and loss of livestock. Elsewhere, Adolfo Boy, an agronomist and spokesman for the GM-sceptic Group for Rural Reflection, was quoted as saying: 'Let Argentina be a warning to others. We are going down the path of destruction.'          Many involved directly in Argentine agriculture said last week that they disagreed with that analysis. Eduardo Trigo, an agricultural consultant who carried out a study in 2002, jointly funded by the Argentine government and an international research centre, said that crops would be damaged only if glyphosate were used 'negligently'. He accused New Scientist of making 'very liberal use' of one such example to paint a misleading picture of Argentine agriculture.          The study also found that the the expansion in soya growing had helped increase rural employment from 700,000 in 1995 to about 900,000 in the late 1990s and concluded that it had made Argentine farmers £4 billion a year richer.          Eugenio Cap, the co-author of the study, said: 'It is highly irresponsible to write an article describing the soya programme as a disaster when in effect it saved a society from economic catastrophe.'          Carlitos Quattordio, an agronomist who works on the 5,000-acre Molinari farm, one of Buenos Aires province's largest soya estates, said: 'I am in the fields every day and I have seen no evidence of these 'superweeds'.          'If the cultivation process is carried out conscientiously there appear to be no adverse effects on the soil or livestock. Glyphosate is simple to use and it kills only the plants on which it is directly placed. As aircraft are not used to spray these crops, it is hard to see how it could end up on other people's land. It certainly has no effect on any animals.'          Gabriela Levitus, the executive director of Argenbio, said that her council had studied the environmental consequences of using glyphosate and found it harmless to other plants, livestock and farm workers. She rejected claims that GM crops reduced the levels of bacteria and other micro-organisms in the soil as 'a complete lie'. GM soya was cultivated in such a way that the organic matter left after the harvest remained on the land, providing cover to maintain the soil's humidity and nutrient levels, she said.          Damage had been caused by some farmers' reluctance to practice crop rotation, but that would be true of any monoculture, whether the crop was genetically modified or not, she said.          'We are not savages who do not look after the soil. Producers and exporters appreciate the risks and, for their own good, are not going to let that situation arise.'"
telegraph,10/1/2006 10:43,technology,"            Our ancestors' lifestyles could be linked to today's obesity and diabetes, writes Roger Highfield                  Expanding waistlines. The asthma epidemic. Falling sperm counts. Could some or even all of these be linked with the diet, health and lifestyle of our parents and grandparents?          Yes, according to a burgeoning field of research that has now raised the fascinating - and alarming - possibility that the sins of the fathers can be visited on sons and even grandsons.           The lives of your grandparents - the air they breathed, the food they ate and the stress they suffered - can directly affect you, decades later, despite you never directly experiencing these things. And the corollary of these 'transgenerational effects' is that people who live unhealthily today could be stacking up problems for future generations.           Such effects have been seen being passed down the female line before but now the first evidence that they also operate on the male line has been gathered by Professor Marcus Pembrey, from University College London, and Swedish colleagues, who publish the work in the European Journal of Human Genetics.           In the first part of their study they analysed the findings of a survey of British couples who had babies in the early Nineties. More than 5,000 fathers in Bristol University's Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were or had been smokers.           Of this group, 166 had started smoking before they were 11, during a period before puberty when the body is especially sensitive to environmental stress. After removing influence of factors such as socio-economic status, Prof Pembrey revealed that men who smoked when young had sons who were significantly fatter than average by the age of nine. A similar effect was not seen for daughters.           Another fascinating clue was found in a remote parish in northern Sweden. Thanks to Överkalix's registries of births and deaths and its detailed harvest records, Prof Pembrey and his colleague, Prof Lars Bygren of Umeå University, found that people whose           paternal grandparents had eaten less between the ages of nine and 12 seemed to live longer. The effect was sex specific - the diet of grandfathers was only linked to the lifespan of grandsons, and that of grandmothers only affected grand-daughters.           Prof Pembrey believes that it could be that the traditional picture of inheritance will have to be modified. These trans-generational effects are thought to be due to an 'epigenetic' mechanism, one that affects the way genes are turned on and off down the generations, rather than the mutations or changes in the genes themselves. Effects inherited down the male line may be due to epigenetic changes to the male Y chromosome, for example.           One alternative mechanism for transgenerational effects can be glimpsed in the way extra copies of genes can turn up when the body develops resistance to cancer drugs, for example. 'Maybe reversible copy number changes like these can sometimes be passed down generations,' he said.          Another possible alternative mechanism was revealed by an Anglo-American team, which found that sperm do more than simply deliver a father's DNA to an egg.           They also carry messenger RNAs - the molecules which carry out the instructions of a paternal gene - to the egg at fertilisation. Stephen Krawetz of Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, and colleagues also found micro RNAs, which bind to sites in target messenger RNA to regulate how they are used. These RNAs may also alter the way genes are used over generations, perhaps in response to a crisis such as starvation, speculated Prof Pembrey.           These transgenerational effects may give pause to epidemiologists, who endlessly sift through health data trying to link lifestyle to health effects, such as the rise in diabetes and obesity. Perhaps some of today's problems have their origins long ago. It is possible the obesity epidemic is another effect that spans generations. It could be nature's way of triggering earlier puberty and reproduction to cope with a drop in sperm counts caused by hormone-like chemicals. To get the full picture, we need to know more about the lifestyles of a patient's ancestors.          Scientists also need to get the big picture of how genes are turned on and off across the entire genetic code - genome - and here Europe is leading the way with its Human Epigenome Project, carried out by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, near Cambridge, Epigenomics AG, in Berlin, and the National Centre of Genotyping, Paris.          So far the effort is half way through studying the way 3,000 genes and other DNA regions that seem important (so called highly-conserved regions) are turned off and on in chromosomes 6, 13, 20 and 22, according to Dr Stephan Beck of the Sanger.          Once the project has surveyed the way that genes are being epigentically marked (off or on) in 48 healthy humans, to see what the average 'epigenome' looks like, Dr Beck said that work can begin comparing which parts of the epigenome are changed in disease and can be inherited down the generations. 'As Prof Pembrey has shown, some of these effects can be stable across the generations, which is astonishing.'"
telegraph,29/04/2005 00:01,news,"            Pioneering stem-cell surgery has restored one mother's sight, says Barbara Lantin                  Setting eyes on your new baby for the first time is an indescribable moment, as any parent will testify. For Deborah Catlyn, it felt miraculous.          When her youngest child was conceived, Deborah was blind. Four months into her pregnancy, she had pioneering surgery that would eventually lead to her regaining her sight. The procedure was completed 18 months later - enabling Deborah to see for the first time the daughter she had named Miracle.          'The nurses told me I should keep the bandages on until the day after the operation, but I peeped through,' says Deborah, 35, a civil servant from Reading who has two sons, Javies, 17 and Beyonta, 11, as well as 19-month-old Miracle. 'I saw a nurse in a blue uniform, I saw a cupboard. I couldn't stop looking. When my children came to see me, I had a big grin on my face.          'The older ones had changed so much and grown so tall in the two and a half years since I lost my sight, but Miracle touched me most because I hadn't seen her at all. People used to stop me in the street when she was tiny and tell me how pretty she was. I couldn't understand what the fuss was about until I lined up the photos of her when I got home. Then I started to cry.'          Deborah, blinded when a woman threw acid in her face at a nightclub in 2002, is one of about 20 patients who have benefited from ground-breaking stem-cell transplantation surgery, performed by Sheraz Daya and his team at the Centre for Sight at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead in Sussex. Many, like Deborah, had undergone previous operations which had failed, and had been told they would never see again. One man had been blind for 15 years.          Mr Daya's technique involves taking stem cells from dead donors, living relatives or even the patients themselves. The cells are grown in the laboratory for two to three weeks until they form sheets, which are laid on the surface of the eye to help it heal. All the patients had lost vision because they had few or no limbal stem cells as a result of burns, chemical accidents or disease.          These cells, made just under the surface of the eye, are constantly regenerating: they keep the outermost epithelial layer of the eye clear so that it can act as an barrier against germs and dust. Without sufficient limbal cells, the cornea becomes overgrown, and vision becomes impaired.          'Before we transplant, we scrape off the material that has grown over the eye,' says Mr Daya, who this month presented the results of a clinical trial of his technique to an international conference of eye specialists in Washington. 'We lay the cultured stem cells on top and then cover them with a biologic dressing made from amniotic membrane which contains growth factors. The patient is given eye drops made from his own blood plasma, which also helps the cells to grow.'          Most patients' vision improves quickly but some - like Deborah - require a corneal transplant later. This will fail if it is done before the surface of the eye is fully restored, which is why Deborah had to wait 18 months for her second operation. Mr Daya estimates that the procedure might be suitable for up to 1,000 patients in the UK. 'The results are quite dramatic and, five years on, seven of the first 10 patients still have good vision,' he says. 'We have not seen survival rates like this before.'          Seeking an explanation for this success, Mr Daya's team made a remarkable discovery. Analysis of patients' limbal stem cells following surgery revealed no donor DNA. 'There are new stem cells there and they can only be coming from one place: the patient's own bone marrow. The donor cells we have put on the eye surface have somehow triggered the body into producing its own limbal cells.'          This finding means patients no longer need strong immunosuppressant drugs designed to stop the body rejecting donor cells. It may also have major implications for other organs. 'If we can figure out what the trigger signal is, we may be able to get heart muscle or even brain tissue to regenerate,' says Mr Daya.          Leading transplant surgeon Prof Nadey Hakim of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, has welcomed Mr Daya's findings. 'Should we succeed in generating entire new organs using the patient's own genetic material, this would overcome the likelihood of the patient rejecting the transplanted organ and cancel the need for immunosuppressive drugs,' he says. 'The work of Mr Daya has undoubtedly brought us closer to realising this dream.'          For Deborah, a dream has already come true. After eight operations - some of them excruciatingly painful - and two and a half years of blindness, she had despaired of regaining her sight. 'Sometimes, I would just sit and cry,' she recalls. 'I couldn't cook for my children, plait their hair, sort their socks. When one of my sons was sick, I could not see what was wrong or pour his medicine. Miracle swallowed a coin and I had no idea until she vomited it up.'          Bonding with her new baby took longer than usual. 'I was not interested in her when I was pregnant or until she had her first injections and I heard her scream. Now she goes everywhere with me. I call her my handbag - I never put her down.'          Deborah can now perform all the tasks she could do before her accident, including driving, but is considering having surgery on her left eye, which was damaged not only by the acid, but also by a childhood accident with a swing. She hopes to return to work shortly. 'I don't have to ask anybody to do anything for me now,' she says. 'I feel like a human being again.'

telegraph,1/6/2004 0:01,news,"            Recent research into gene therapy has produced encouraging results, reports Christine Doyle                  Few professors of neurosurgery would be so confident as to describe the results of recent research as 'fabulous'. When, however, the professor is Tipu Aziz, consultant neurosurgeon at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, and regarded by the Parkinson's Disease Society as a 'key opinion leader', it is safe to assume that he is on to something.           The research that excites Aziz was carried out in France and relates to gene therapy. It involves genetically manipulating viruses to produce dopamine, the neurotransmitter that controls smooth movement and is deficient in the brains of Parkinson's sufferers.           Parkinson's is a progressive and devastating neurological disorder that can affect all activities, including talking, swallowing, walking and writing. It arises when defective cells in the part of the brain that controls movement die. Why this happens is unclear, but once 80 per cent of the cells have been destroyed, the symptoms emerge. About 120,000 people in Britain are affected, and 10,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.           'The manipulated viruses would act as a `repair' – rather than simply an alleviation of symptoms – in the hope that drugs would become unnecessary,' says Aziz. 'So far, the research with viruses has been carried out only on animals. Initial results in rats were encouraging, and work last year in monkeys is even more promising – fabulous. Basically, normal movement, activity and behaviour were restored. The technique appears to be safe and the monkeys have continued to produce dopamine.' The next step is to test the concept in humans, and Aziz is planning an initial trial.           'It could start within 18 months, once approval is given by the gene therapy advisory committee,' Aziz is due to tell those attending the second in this year's Science Today, Health Tomorrow lectures at the Royal Institution in London on June 16. These lectures, which enable members of the public to question experts about the latest research, are supported by The Daily Telegraph and sponsored by the healthcare company Novartis.            In fact, the Oxford trial would not be the first gene therapy trial for Parkinson's. A trial under way in New York involves switching off the hyperactivity of the subthalamic nucleus that drives the Parkinson's symptoms. However, Aziz has reservations. 'The technique turns a critical area of the brain from positive to negative. We do not know enough about the brain's neural interactions to know what that will do.'           At present, drugs that restore levels of dopamine in the brain are the mainstay of Parkinson's treatment. Although they are initially effective, they cause severe side effects in up to 70 per cent of patients. These include confusion and hallucinations.            While future drugs might minimise these problems, neurosurgery is increasingly used in the meantime. And thanks to molecular and technological advances over the past 10 years, it is ever more exact. Pallidotomy, for example, which involves burning out tissue in a part of the brain called the globus pallidus to reduce involuntary movement, is less likely to cause side effects than in the past.           Fifteen years ago, American researchers showed that the subthalamic nucleus, which had not previously been associated with Parkinson's, was over-active in sufferers. This led to the development of the deep brain stimulation technique. The surgeon implants electrodes in the subthalamic tissue and they are controlled by the patient using an external switch.           This technique, pioneered in France, has become a major and – at more than £30,000 – expensive form of treatment. About one in five patients might benefit, and it can reduce tremor, rigidity and slowness of movement.           'Another one in five patients have a related syndrome – a kind of `Parkinson's plus' condition –and are unable to move properly,' says Aziz. 'This syndrome is resistant to drugs, so the patients have no break from their excruciating symptoms. We are now working on stimulating the peduncular pontine nucleus, an area deep in the brain, but it could be four years before we can try it in patients.'           The targeted injection of chemicals – nerve growth factors – into affected brain tissue is another approach, being researched in Bristol.           Inevitably, some therapies have failed to live up to their promise. 'Foetal cell transplants did not lead to a dramatic improvement,' says Aziz. 'The logistics of collection after terminations were horrendous – and controversial.'           An equally controversial alternative is to transplant stem cells developed from embryos used for research and manipulated to produce dopamine. 'One drawback is that in animal studies some transplants get out of control and grow tumours deep in the brain. Although the technique offers real hope, we are more than five years from clinical use.'                     'I can be a mum again'                    When Ashley Harting was pregnant with her third child, her husband noticed, one night, that her left hand was shaking while she slept. She was 30 at the time, and the shaking continued after the birth of Francesca, who is now 13.          'I think most people noticed it well before I was aware of it,' says Harting. 'I was an educational welfare officer, which involved driving all over the county, and my driving started to get quite erratic. But my GP dismissed my concern. He said, incredibly, that it was my age: I had had three children, so what did I expect?           'Then, I had a serious car accident – nothing to do with my shaking – but my condition deteriorated afterwards. I felt frightened and insisted on being referred to a specialist.'          The specialist diagnosed writer's cramp. 'He suggested I was swinging the lead and wanted time off work. He even tutted while he was talking to me.' After a second consultant suggested that she might have multiple sclerosis or Huntingdon's disease, she and her husband split up.          'I felt under enormous stress. I was shaking, my speech was slurred, my movements were becoming impaired. Yet another doctor suggested it was all in my head – after a while, I began to think it must be true.'          Harting was 36 when she was finally diagnosed. Shortly after moving back to her home county of Lincolnshire, a GP, who became very supportive, told her she had been seriously misdiagnosed. 'Even then, the hospital chaplain asked me, patronisingly, if I was a young person with an old person's disease.'           In fact, Harting was among the five per cent of Parkinson's sufferers who are diagnosed under the age of 40. She was given a variety of pills and – as she was a young patient – was treated as a guinea pig, to some extent.           'At the time, I was on an average of 40 or 50 pills a day,' she says, 'and although these helped, my symptoms were hard to control. I was in and out of hospital, seeing a range of specialists. At times, I could scarcely walk, though I was determined to carry on as normally as possible for the sake of the children, who were now without a dad.          'Often, I could not cook properly for them or join in their activities. At one point, they had to help me to do everything, even washing and dressing. In the past, I had always talked fast – gabbled even – but now I was talking slowly and slurring my words and had become a quiet person, my friends tell me.'          The turning point came when Harting's GP felt she needed more help. She was put on a trial for deep brain stimulation at the National Hospital for Neurology in London. 'The stimulator is like a pacemaker and I turn it on from an external control on the left side of my chest, below the collarbone. It was not pleasant having it implanted – it took eight hours – but I knew it was working straight away. My movements became much smoother, the shaking eased and I began to walk and speak properly. After about six months, I felt completely stable. I am now off all medication.'          Harting, now 43, stresses she is not cured. 'I have problems with urinary incontinence, and try to avoid stress, which makes it worse,' she says. 'I don't know what will happen in the long term.'          Linda Kelly, chief executive of the Parkinson's Disease Society and chairman of the Science Today, Health Tomorrow lecture, is not surprised at Harting's delayed diagnosis. 'We still hear of doctors who suggest a patient's symptoms are due to alcohol,' she says. 'We stress the importance of having access to treatment as early as possible, at any age, to slow progression of the disease, prevent depression and enable the patient to live as normally as possible.'          Harting describes the effect of the brain stimulator as phenomenal. She now cooks, gardens with Francesca and can even drive her elder daughter, Lydia, to college.           'My children and my mother were so supportive, never grudging,' she says. 'Now, I feel like a normal mum again.'

telegraph,11/10/2007 19:00,news,"            They are beginning to understand how pond life can thrive without sex, reports Roger Highfield                  Some have billed it as the longest 'headache' ever - a strange form of pond life that abandoned sex more than 80 million years ago.         The peculiar creatures, called bdelloid rotifers, have given evolutionary scientists a headache too, because organisms that clone themselves - instead of using sex to mix their DNA - are thought to become extinct after a few million years because they are unable to adapt to new conditions, such as droughts in the case of the rotifers.          Now a Cambridge team reports in the journal Science that it has at last solved the riddle of how these creatures have managed to survive and thrive, ending decades of effort to crack the problem.          Sex is crucial because it scrambles genes much more quickly than random DNA mutations and helps new species to evolve and emerge as the environment changes. Even bacteria have a primitive form of sex, where they exchange genes to add variety to their entire genetic complement, or genome.          But this pond life has been the one ugly fact undermining the beauty of sex: the translucent organisms abandoned sex such a long time ago that they were once denounced as an 'evolutionary scandal' by the late and great biologist Prof John Maynard Smith.          A few years ago a team at Harvard University showed that bdelloids didn't indulge in what scientists call cryptic sex, sneaking off for a quick one when no-one was looking. These creatures really have survived without sex, but how do they do it?          Today, in the journal Science, a team led by Dr Alan Tunnacliffe from the Institute of Biotechnology at the University of Cambridge has found that part of the answer to the riddle lies in the fact that the creatures have two copies of each gene, as humans do.         But unlike humans, where both genes do the same thing, the bdelloids can use each copy in different ways - and this can only happen in creatures that clone each other, rather than have sex. 'It's like they have two genes for the price of one, and they have used this evolutionary bargain to improve their lifestyle.'          'Asexual reproduction means bdelloids don't keep two (almost) identical copies of each gene in the genome, like sexual organisms. So when bdelloids became asexual (from a sexual ancestor), it was as if they suddenly had two genomes instead of one.'          The team studied Adineta ricciae, a species which comes from an Australian billabong, to find out how it can cope with dry conditions: two copies of a gene called 'lea' are different and therefore generate proteins with different roles to protect the animal during dehydration. One copy protects essential proteins from clumping together as the animal dries out, while the other helps to maintain the fragile membranes that surround its cells.          This is the first time that this evolutionary trick - given the technical name of the Meselson effect - has been shown in any asexual animal, and shows that lack of sex can be positively life enhancing.          Dr Tunnacliffe commented: 'It's particularly exciting that we've found different, but complementary, functions in genes which help bdelloid rotifers survive desiccation. Evolution of gene function in this way can't happen in sexual organisms, which means there could be some benefit to millions of years without sex after all.'          The different genes enable bdelloids to survive being dehydrated for years. They then revive, having suffered no ill effect, once water becomes available again. And without even a scintilla of sex the egg laying microscopic creatures - widely distributed in mosses, creeks and ponds - have managed to diverge into nearly 400 species.          The research, funded by the The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and The Leverhulme Trust, was conducted as part of a collaboration with academics from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, as well as from France and Germany."
telegraph,1/3/2007 0:01,news,"            What are embryonic stem (ES) cells?                  Embryonic stem cells are cells derived from an early stage embryo (4-5 days in humans) that can renew themselves through cell division and can differentiate into all the other types of cells in the body.                     Why are scientists so keen to create and study them?                  They believe that in the future it will be possible to use ES cells to grow a wide range of new tissue and body parts damaged through disease or injury. It is hoped that studying ES cells from individuals with currently incurable medical conditions will lead to better understanding of their illness and possibly new treatments.                     Why can't they just get them from human embryos?                  South Korean scientist Prof Hwang Woo-suk raised hopes around the world in 2005 when he published research suggesting he had created embryonic stem cells using cloned human embryos produced from donated human eggs. A year later most of this work he admitted having fabricated much of the work.         There are some risks for women who donate eggs and at present many scientists feel unhappy putting such volunteers in danger when they could be a long way from reliably creating stem cell lines from human eggs.                     What is a chimera?                  Chimeras are organisms that contain at least two genetically different groups of cells originating from different species. Each population of cells keeps its own character and the result is a mosaic of mis-matched parts.                     What is a hybrid?                  A hybrid is formed when the sperm of one species is used to fertilise an egg from another species. A mule is the hybrid offspring of a horse and a donkey. Every cell in the resulting organism has chromosomes from each species.                     What is a cybrid?                  Also known as a cytoplasmic hybrid, a cybrid is created by inserting a whole cell from one organism into an egg that has been emptied of its nucleus (a cytoplast) from another. The cybrid is a clone of the organism whose cell was used as they have the same DNA."
telegraph,13/12/2007 00:01,news," Today The Daily Telegraph reveals the 21 names in the frame for the title   of Morgan Stanley Great Briton 2007. After thousands of nominations from the   public, the judging panels narrowed the field down to three contenders in   each of seven categories. But which of these great British achievers will   land the overall title?  Morgan Stanley Great       Britons awards   Join       our campaign to celebrate Britishness  ARTS The judges Donald Moore - chairman, Morgan Stanley Group, Europe (chairman) Sarah Crompton - Arts Editor, The Daily Telegraph Tony Hall - chief executive, Royal Opera House Sandra Howard - author Julia Peyton-Jones - director, Serpentine Gallery Sir John Tusa - chairman, Wigmore Hall Trust Henry Wyndham - chairman, Sotheby's Europe The shortlist Damien Hirst (artist)One of Britain's most radical creative forces, Hirst pulled off the artistic   coup of 2007 with For the Love of God - an 18th century skull covered in   8,601 jewels, including £12 million worth of diamonds. The artist said that he was inspired by an Aztec turquoise skull at the   British Museum and hopes his work will be displayed at the institution one   day. In addition, in June this year he set the saleroom record for a living   artist, when Lullaby Spring, a stainless steel medicine cabinet holding   6,136 handcrafted and painted pills, went for £9..65 million.The judges described Hirst as 'Britain's biggest art export' and 'globally   the biggest thing in the art world'. Hirst's reach is 'wider,   deeper and more embracing than any other British artist', they said,   creating a 'feeding frenzy from people who aren't usually into art'. The judges described For the Love of God as an 'exceptionally daring'   piece of work which made it impossible to exclude Hirst from the Arts   shortlist.Sir Ian McKellen (actor)One of the most acclaimed actors of his generation, McKellen has been honoured   with more than 40 international awards for his performances on stage and   screen. While movie blockbusters such as X-Men and Lord of the Rings have   brought him international stardom, he originally found fame playing the   title role in Edward II both on stage and television. In 1972, McKellen co-founded the Actors' Company, earning him a reputation as   a spokesman for actors and the British theatre in general. He also remains   an outspoken advocate for the gay rights campaigning group Stonewall. This year he returned to the stage to great acclaim, appearing in the Royal   Shakespeare Company's The Seagull and in the title role of King Lear.The judges described McKellen as 'one of the last great actors' who   delivers a 'quality of acting that you have to be awed by'. His   performance in King Lear; perhaps Shakespeare's most demanding roles was,   said one judge, 'simply brilliant'.JK Rowling (author)The creator of the Harry Potter books. This year saw publication of the final   novel in the series. Selling 11 million copies in its first 24 hours, it   broke the record for the fastest-selling book, previously held by the sixth   Harry Potter novel, which sold nine million on its first day in 2005. The books have been translated into 64 languages and The Order of Phoenix   managed to become the first English language book to top the bestseller list   in France. In addition, the film of the Order of the Phoenix, in which Harry painfully   begins to understand the battles with evil that lie ahead, was released this   year. It was hailed as a deliciously dark affair, brimming with impressively   gritty performances, still managing to balance magical wonder with   breathless excitement.The judges described Rowling's 'unprecedented global reach' as   phenomenal - even her official website is available in six languages. More than anything, they were impressed by the way she had managed to infect   children (and adults) the world over with an enthusiasm for reading. They   conceded that the form of her novels was 'conventional to a tee',   but were impressed by the way she had given them a 'modern, imaginative   twist'.BUSINESS The judges Brian Magnus - co-head of Morgan Stanley European Private Equity (chairman) Donald Brydon - chairman, Smiths Group Mary Francis - senior independent director of Centrica plc Sir John Parker - chairman, National Grid Sophie Brodie - business reporter, The Daily Telegraph Sir Martin Sorrell - chief executive, WPP The shortlist Sir Ronald Cohen (founder, Apax Partners)In 1971, with two partners, Sir Ronald founded Apax Partners, Britain's first   venture capital firm. The company expanded rapidly in the 1990s, becoming   Britain's largest venture capital firm. Apax has provided start-up capital for more than 500 companies, and invested   in many others, including AOL, Virgin Radio, Waterstone's, and PPL   Therapeutics, the company that cloned Dolly the sheep.He is also a member of the Executive Committee of the International Institute   of Strategic Studies and is on the Board of Trustees of the British Museum.The judges were impressed by the way in which he had taken a firm with a   European market base and made it into a 'truly global' company.   Not only that, he had managed 'take the Americans on at their own game'.They approved of the way in which Sir Ronald had 'accepted [Apax's] role   in society' and had acted in a 'socially responsible' manner,   while being an outspoken defender of the private equity industry.Sir John Rose (chief executive, Rolls-Royce)As chief executive of Rolls-Royce, Sir John has presided over a revival in the   fortunes of one of the world's major aero engine makers.His strategy to provide 'power by the hour' has enabled Rolls-Royce   to transform itself into a company in which services now account for more   than half of group revenues.At the end of the third quarter this year, Rolls-Royce announced a record   order book of £35.1 billion, an increase of 34 per cent over the 2006 year   end figure. Sir John is a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society and,   until recently, the chairman of the Prince's Trust.The judges hailed Sir John for doing a 'superb job' in a tough   industry - placing Britain at the forefront of the aeronautical engine   industry. His efforts had also helped generate a rise in the wealth and   productivity of the city of Derby, where Rolls-Royce has its main   engineering base.The judges cited Rolls-Royce provision of the Trent 900 engine for the new   Airbus 380 this year as 'a fantastic achievement'.Michael Spencer (founder, ICAP)Michael Spencer is the man behind the world's largest inter-dealer money   broker and, not surprisingly, one of the richest men in Britain. After   losing his job at Drexel Burnham, he resolved to establish his own business,   setting up ICAP in 1986.The brokerage mushroomed into a £3.3 billion empire and recently ICAP reported   record revenues and profit for the six months to Sept 30 2007.This year Mr Spencer was named Entrepreneur of the Year at the European   Business Leader Awards and in November he was awarded the prestigious Beacon   Fellowship Prize for setting up ICAP's Charity Day.Last year the firm raised £4.2 million for a clutch of charities from Cancer   Warriors in the Philippines to the Meningitis Trust, bringing the total   since 1993 to £22 million.He is also the owner of the spread betting firm City Index and chairman of   Numis Securities.The judges described Mr Spencer as a 'hugely successfully entrepreneur',   who had overseen one of the few businesses to do well this year despite the   credit crunch - reinforcing his reputation as one of the most influential   men in the City of London.CAMPAIGNING AND PUBLIC LIFE The judges Caroline Silver - managing director and vice-chairman Investment Banking   Division, Morgan Stanley (chairman) Yasmin Alibhai-Brown - journalist Professor Andrew Burrows - University of Oxford Julia Cleverdon - chief executive, Business in the Community Sir George Cox - chairman, VSO Michael Hintze - chief executive, CQS Rachel Lomax - deputy governor, Bank of England Richard Preston - Comment Editor, The Daily Telegraph David Robinson - senior adviser, Community Links The Shortlist Shami Chakrabarti (director, Liberty)Miss Chakrabarti has run Liberty, the civil liberties pressure group, since   2003. After graduating from the London School of Economics, she worked as a   barrister at the Home Office, before joining Liberty in 2001. She spent the next two years campaigning against the anti-terrorist measures   that followed the September 11 terrorist attacks and is a prominent opponent   of the Government's ID card proposals. In 2006, she was the runner-up in the   Channel 4 Political Awards' 'Most Inspiring Political Figure'   category. She is a frequent contributor to BBC Radio 4 on the topic of human rights and   civil liberties, a Visiting Fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, and a Master   of the Bench of Middle Temple. This year she received an Honorary Doctor of   Law degree from the University of East Anglia and was awarded the CBE. The   judges described her as a woman who has had an 'incredible impact'   and who is a 'consummate campaigner'.Sir Ranulph Fiennes (explorer)Britain's most famous living adventurer, Sir Ranulph was the first man to   travel from the North Pole to the South Pole (covering 52,000 miles in the   process), using surface transport alone and the first man to cross the   Antarctic by foot. These feats helped him win the Polar Medal. He is also an   author and has published 13 books. In 2003, despite having a double heart bypass operation just four months   earlier, Sir Ranulph managed to complete seven marathons in seven days on   seven continents, raising thousands of pounds for the British Heart   Foundation. In March this year, despite a lifelong fear of heights, he   undertook the challenge to climb the Eiger by its daunting north face.The judges were impressed by a character who 'could only be British'   and who 'couldn't come from anywhere else'. They said he was 'a   fantastic illustration of what can be achieved' and had set an example   to many people that there is life after bypass surgery - particularly during   his epic week of marathons. The combination of his 'so very British' attributes and his   phenomenal achievements made him an obvious choice for the shortlist.Marion Janner (founder, Star Wards Project)In October last year, Marion Janner set up Star Wards following her time as a   detained psychiatric inpatient. The project works with mental health trusts   to improve inpatients' daily experiences and treatment. Star Wards aims to inspire better therapy for patients, making best use of   their time and skills and those of staff. To date, almost 200 wards have   joined the scheme, which has translated into thousands of inpatients having   many more therapeutic, social and recreational opportunities. One matron wrote: 'In my opinion every acute ward in the country should   implement as many of the Star Wards ideas as they possibly can. I have never   known an initiative to be met with such enthusiasm by the staff that   actually work on our wards. Somehow it manages to combine improvements in   the quality of care for patients with improvements in job satisfaction for   our front line staff - a winning combination'.The judges praised an extraordinary woman who 'saw a need and did   something about it' - tackling an unfashionable area that 'most   people don't want to talk about'.CREATIVE INDUSTRIES The judges David Law - head of Financial Sponsors Group International, Morgan Stanley   (chairman) Hilary Alexander - Fashion Director, The Daily Telegraph Raymond Blanc - chef Rita Clifton - chairman, Interbrand Grayson Perry - artist Colin Tweedy - chief executive, Arts & Business The Shortlist Michael Boyd (artistic director, RSC)Belfast-born Boyd has been an associate director of the Royal Shakespeare   Company since 1996. The 47-year-old began his career at Coventry's Belgrade   Theatre, before becoming associate director of the Crucible Theatre in   Sheffield. His productions for the RSC include The Broken Heart (1994/5),   Measure for Measure (1996/7), The Spanish Tragedy (1997/8), and Henry VI   parts I, II and III and Richard III, for which he won the Olivier award for   best director. From April 2006 to April 2007, the RSC hosted a year-long festival of the   entire Shakespeare canon at its Stratford-upon-Avon home. The company   invited theatre companies from across the world and around the UK to join it   in a unique celebration of Shakespeare's works. The Complete Works was the   first time all 37 plays, the sonnets and the long poems have been presented   at the same event.The judges said Boyd had 'kept a low profile but quietly brought the   Royal Shakespeare Company back to its greatness' and managed to place   Shakespeare back at 'the top of the tree'.Stephen Fry (actor and presenter)Comedian, writer, actor, filmmaker, television personality - Stephen Fry is   one of the great British polymaths. As one half of the Fry and Laurie double   act, he has appeared in A Bit of Fry and Laurie and Jeeves and Wooster,   while also bringing Oscar Wilde to life in the cinema and making a   successful career as a novelist.Fry has spoken publicly about his experience with bipolar disorder and has   presented a documentary about it, Stephen Fry: The Secret Life of the   Manic-Depressive. The two-part series was broadcast in 2006, repeated in   March 2007 as part of the BBC's programming in aid of Comic Relief. He was   nominated for Best Entertainment Performance (QI) and Best Factual Series   (Secret Life of the Manic Depressive) at the 2007 British Academy Television   Awards.The judges agreed that Fry is 'the epitome of everything British, both   modern and old' and - despite his huge intellect - a man who can   communicate in a down to earth manner.Jonathan Ive (senior vice president of industrial design, Apple Inc.)Jonathan Ive is renowned as the principal designer behind the iMac, iPod and   the iPhone. He joined Apple's design team in 1992 when the company was at   its lowest ebb. On an executive level Steve Jobs had been ousted in a   boardroom coup and the company became embroiled in a bitter patent dispute   with Microsoft over the Windows operating system. Apple became unprofitable and was losing ground to Windows. This, coupled with   embarrassing product recalls, contributed to a business on the brink. In   1997, Steve Jobs returned to the company and began to revive Apple's   fortunes. Mr Ive was instrumental in this turnaround, fuelling a period of   unrivalled creativity and innovation which continues to this day.In 2007, he received the National Design Award in the product design category   for his work on the iPhone.The judges said this British design genius had made 'a huge, huge impact   on the world' by creating 'outstanding iconic designs [which] have   transformed Apple's technology into must-have everyday consumer items.'ENVIRONMENT The judges Paul Baker - head of corporate broking, Morgan Stanley (chairman) Paul Eccleston - Editor, Earth Channel, telegraph.co.uk Julia Hailes - author, The Green Consumer Guide Aubrey Meyer - founder and director, Global Commons Institute Charles Perry - managing director, Good Energy The shortlist Jeremy Leggett (chief executive, Solarcentury)Jeremy Leggett has been described by Time magazine as 'one of the key   players in putting the climate issue on the world agenda'. Before   setting up Solarcentury, he was an award-winning scientist, oil-industry   consultant and Greenpeace campaigner. He is also a director of the private equity renewable energy fund, Bank   Sarasin's New Energies Invest AG, and served on the UK Government's   Renewables Advisory Board from 2002 to 2006. Solarcentury is committed to donating five per cent of its annual net profit   to SolarAid, the charity it set up in September last year, which Mr Leggett   chairs. It aims to relieve poverty through facilitating the provision of   solar energy to those in need.The judges felt he deserved to be recognised for making solar power a real   option in the UK. 'A compelling speaker' and a 'great   communicator', he has been a 'key player in increasing the supply   of renewable energy and investment in it'.Sir Jonathan Porritt (co-founder, Forum for the future)Established in 1996, Forum for the future is now the UK's leading sustainable   development charity. Sir Jonathan was appointed Chairman of the UK   Sustainable Development Commission in July 2000 by the then Prime Minister,   Tony Blair, who described him as 'one of the most prominent voices   promoting green issues over the last 25 years'.Having started out as an English teacher at an inner city comprehensive   school, Sir Jonathan became head of Friends of the Earth in 1984. By the   time he left in 1996, he had increased its supporters from 12,700 to   226,300. His style has been described as 'passionate but rational,' and the   fact that 'he does not threaten, but cajoles' has often been cited   as the reason why he has been so successful at effecting change at the   highest levels.The judges wanted to recognise Sir Jonathan for a lifetime of work as one of   the best known environmentalists in Britain. They described him as having 'a   real depth of knowledge on a huge range of issues and an opinion that is   always worth listening to'.Tim Smit (co-founder and chief executive, Eden Project)A disenchanted archaeology student turned millionaire record producer, Tim   Smit moved to Cornwall in 1987. There, underneath some bramble bushes, he   discovered the remains of sumptuous gardens dating back to the 12th century. After two years of restoration, his Lost Gardens of Heligan became the subject   of a television documentary and, with 350,000 visitors a year, one of the   county's top tourist attractions.He is also co-founder and chief executive of the Eden Project in Cornwall,   which has pulled in more than nine million visitors since it opened. This   £40 million scientific institution is combined with a visitor attraction   dedicated to promoting the understanding of human dependence on plants. In April this year, Eden announced plans for Britain's first tourist   attraction dedicated to climate change and how humans will live with   increasing temperatures. The new £67 million building, called The Edge, will   generate its own light from turbines and heat from stored warm air.The judges were unanimous in shortlisting Mr Smit, describing him as 'a   man with a vision' to whom 'nothing seems daunting'.SCIENCE AND INNOVATION The judges Saul Nathan, managing director, Financial Sponsors Group, Morgan Stanley   (chairman) Professor John Beddington - Professor, Imperial College Roger Highfield - Science Editor, The Daily Telegraph Professor Steve Jones - Professor of Genetics, University College London Dr Michael Lynch - chief executive, Autonomy Systems Sir Roger Penrose - Professor, Mathematical Institute Dame Nancy Rothwell - vice president of research, University of Manchester Professor Ian Smith - professor in cancer medicine, Royal Marsden Hospital Richard Wilson - partner, Apax The shortlist Professor Colin BlakemoreA professor of neuroscience at both Oxford and Warwick universities and   chairman of the General Advisory Committee on Science to the Food Standards   Agency, Professor Blakemore was, until earlier this year, chief executive of   the Medical Research Council. He has been awarded the Royal Society's Michael Faraday Prize for excellence   in communicating science to UK audiences and holds six honorary degrees.The judges commended Professor Blakemore's courage in 'taking on the   government and animal rights activist alike' and his ability to 'bring   people along to science'. They also cited the fact that he took the journal Science on over a paper he   disagreed with, which shows real guts as most are 'desperate not to   offend'. They cited his drug classification paper, published in The Lancet this year,   which described alcohol and tobacco as more harmful than cannabis and   several Class A drugs such as ecstasy, as 'innovative stuff.'Professor Sir Martin EvansProfessor Sir Martin Evans is Director of the School of Biosciences and   Professor of Mammalian Genetics at Cardiff University. He has been described   as 'the father of stem cell research' and one of '10 Britons   who have shaped our world'. His pioneering research into mouse teratocarcinoma stem cells in tissue   culture systems led to the discovery of embryonic stem cells. In turn this   discovery led to the creation of legions of 'knockout' mice which   can be genetically modified to develop human diseases. He was awarded the   Nobel prize for medicine in October.The judges said his work had achieved a 'massive impact on Britain'   helping to 'bring science into the government'. An 'outstanding   biologist', the panel described him as an 'interesting,   underestimated character', whose brilliant work had, to some degree,   been overshadowed by the publicity surrounding the Roslin Institute and   Dolly the sheep.Professor Sir David KingProfessor Sir David King will step down as the Government's Chief Scientific   Adviser and Head of the Office of Science and Technology at the end of this   year, after seven years at the helm. In that time he has advised ministers   on everything from GM foods to stem cell research, and foot and mouth   disease to nuclear power. Science has never been higher up the political or media agenda, and Sir David   has often been in the middle of those flashpoints where science meets   politics. Perhaps his most controversial moment came in 2004 when he said   climate change was a far greater threat to the world than international   terrorism. As the statement reverberated in headlines around the world, Sir David went on   to berate the US for failing to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. Friend and veteran former MP Tam Dalyell said many appreciated the scientist's   stance: 'It went down jolly well with many of us who knew that he was   right. It wasn't a question of sticking his head out a little bit; it was   sticking his head well above the parapet.'The judges said Sir David was 'extraordinarily smart in the management of   foot and mouth', particularly given he came from a non-biological   background. They felt his readiness to go in and 'ruffle some feathers'   was a distinctly British characteristic and commended his great honesty   during one of the nation's worst agricultural crises.SPORT The judges Simon Smith - managing director and head of UK IBD, Morgan Stanley (chairman) John Kelly - chairman, GalaCoral Damon Hill - former racing car driver Dr Guy Sanan - trustee, Laureus Sport for Good Foundation Thomas Godfrey - commercial director, Sport England Keith Perry - Sports Editor, The Daily Telegraph The shortlist Lewis Hamilton (F1 driver)Hamilton's career started in 1993 when he was just eight years old and by the   age of 10 he had won his first British kart championship. Three years later,   the prodigy was spotted and subsequently signed up by the McLaren and   Mercedes-Benz Young Driver Support Programme. The programme, established by McLaren boss Ron Dennis, provided Hamilton with   a long-term contract guaranteeing financial and technical support to help   with his driving career. He remains the only teenager to be signed by a   Formula 1 team at such an early age. By 2006, Hamilton was the 2006 GP2 champion and this year came agonisingly   close to landing the biggest prize in motor sport - The Formula One   Championship.The judges said: 'You sometimes see people in sport who just make you go   'wow' - he's one of them.' In addition to his fantastic achievements this year, the judges felt he was   the 'greatest ambassador for British sport in 2007 because he carries   himself with modesty and dignity'. He led the F1 championship for most   of the year while others were trying to backstab one another and 'lost   with dignity'.Ricky Hatton (boxer)Ricky Hatton is seen by many as one of the greatest British fighters of all   time. His victory in 2005 over Kostya Tszyu, then widely regarded as one of   the world's top pound-for-pound boxers, announced his entry to the upper   echelons of the boxing scene. While he has fluctuated between welterweight and light welterweight, he has   been a champion in both divisions, winning the WBA title on Nov 26 2005, the   WBA welterweight crown on May 13 2006 and the unified IBF and IBO light   welterweight titles.His defeat to the brilliant Floyd Mayweather last Saturday means Hatton's   boxing future now hangs in the balance, but the judges deemed him to be 'an   amazing sportsman with a brilliant character'.Sir Robin Knox-Johnston (sailor)Sir Robin Knox-Johnston is widely known for becoming the first man to   circumnavigate the globe non-stop and single-handed in 1969. In 1996 he   established the first Clipper Round the World Yacht Race and has since   worked with the Clipper Ventures company as chairman. This year, he completed his second solo circumnavigation of the world in the   yacht SAGA Insurance, finishing in 4th place in the Velux 5 Oceans race. At   68 he was the oldest competitor in the race.The judges agreed that Sir Robin was 'an inspirational character… he is   Fiennes but on the sea'. One added: 'We are naming a Great Briton   and when I think of that, he comes to mind.'• The seven category winners and the overall Morgan Stanley Great   Briton will be announced at a gala dinner in London next month.

telegraph,8/2/2013 18:50,news,"‘Grow your own’ hip replacements could become available within a decade, according to British scientists working on a new type of prosthetic that would become an organic part of the body. Rather than being given metal and ceramic hip replacements, which wear out,   patients would receive an implant made from a new plastic material that   first stimulates new bone to grow - and then degrades away. The end result would be ‘new’ hip made of natural bone, which would easily   last the recipient the rest of their days. Scientists at the universities of Edinburgh and Southampton have joined forces   on the project to create the artificial bone material, which, like the real   thing, has a ‘honeycomb’ structure containing millions of tiny holes. Professor Mark Bradley, a chemist at Edinburgh University, explained that this   “scaffold” prompted stem cells to morph into bone cells. He said: “We all have stem cells flowing through us, and these would hook on   to the scaffold.”When the stem cells attached themselves to the material, they took this as the   signal to turn themselves into bone cells rather than blood cells, he added. He said the idea behind the seven-year project was to create a type of   artificial bone which could help heal shattered or worn out limbs. Those with osteoporosis could benefit, he said, before adding: “Certain things   wear out before others - hips for example.”He continue: “The idea is that you would shape a replacement hip to what was   wanted, put it in position, and wait. “Over time the cells would recruit on to the scaffold, which would itself   start to degrade. The good bone formed would take its place.”He and Richard Oreffo, professor of musculoskeletal science at Southampton   University, have started testing the material in animals. They have also   proved the principle with human tissue in lab tests. Their study, published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials,   was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. Prof Bradley said: “We would like to start human trials, but we have to get   regulatory approval, which takes time and is expensive. It will probably be   five years until we start them.”He emphasised that, if these trials were successful, it would be longer still   before 'plastic hips' were widely available to patients. Prof Oreffo said before whole hips were created, it could be used to help   surgeons add bone material when carrying out second hip replacements using   conventional implants.'If you have a hip replacement, and you have to have it revised after 10 or 15   years, you need bone stock to keep it from rattling around,' he said.This is because when surgeons take out an implant and replace it, they need to   take a little more natural bone off to create a fresh surface.He explained that the material was 'osteo-conductive' for stem cells: 'They   realise this is a nice structure to colonise'He said they had already tested the technique in mice and would next be trying   it in sheep. Part of the purpose of the trial is to rule out any toxicity   issues.Bone fragility is a huge health issue in Britain, one which will increase as   the number of older people rises. According to the National Osteoporosis Society, there are about 300,000   fragility fractures in the UK every year, while some 14,000 die due to hip   fractures. Neither are hip replacements confined to those with osteoporosis. Significant numbers have hips replaced at a relatively young age. They then   need second replacements as they original prosthetics wear out. Problems have also arisen recently with some types of ‘metal-on-metal’   implants, which are meant to last longer, but have been found to have high   failure rates and potantially cause blood poisoning.

telegraph,16/10/2007 01:01,news,"A biotechnology firm has sparked an ethics row by encouraging couples to use embryos left over from IVF treatment as a personalised family 'repair kit'.         The company is offering those who have had infertility treatment the chance to extract stem cells from spare embryos, in the hope that they could be used to treat Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, heart disease and other conditions.         But leading scientists accused StemLifeLine of exploitation and preying on people's fears, while ethics campaigners called the procedure an extreme example of the 'commodification of human embryos'.         Stem cells, the building blocks used by the body for growth and repair, can turn into any other type of cell and are used to mend and replace damaged tissue.         Those taken from adults or from umbilical cord blood have been used to treat illnesses such as leukaemia and sickle cell anaemia, but early tests suggest embryonic         stem cells could be more useful because of their flexibility. StemLifeLine, based in California, said creating and storing personalised stem cells from spare IVF embryos — at a cost of £8,500 — reduced the risk of them being rejected.          Should we keep embryos as 'health insurance'?"
telegraph,9/12/2004 0:01,news,"A bird known by her wing band number, 256, is about to cause a huge flap in genetics, one which could change our understanding of human evolution and bird behaviour and help to prevent another global influenza pandemic.          The seven-year-old red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), which runs around the Michigan State University campus, is a member of the species from which all domestic chickens are descended.          It has become the first bird and the first agricultural animal to have its entire genetic code - its genome - read and analysed.          This sheds light on that old conundrum of why the chicken crossed the road. The analysis suggests the birds have a better sense of smell than thought, so they are probably attracted by aromas on the other side of the street.          The breakthrough is reported today in the journal Nature by more than 175 scientists from Britain, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.          The analysis is not just about getting bigger eggs and tastier chicken, it is already giving surprising insights into the human genome, from shedding light on the role of supposedly 'junk' DNA to filling in the details of our evolution from ancient fish.          The chicken has been shown to lack the molecular wherewithal to detect bitter tastes and a chicken counterpart to an important human immune system protein has been identified.          We may also soon be thanking 256 for better treatments or new vaccines for flu and other diseases, according to Prof Jerry Dodgson, who runs the facility that she calls home.          'Chickens and humans are, in some cases, infected by the same viruses, bacteria and parasites,' he said.          'The research shows that chickens and humans share more than half of their genes. The chicken genome sequence is expected to help us uncover genes that enhance natural disease resistance in birds. Then we can see if those same genes are in humans.'          Scientists identified a chicken gene for interleukin 26, an immune response protein previously only seen in humans, so further study of the chicken's immune system may lead to better ways to control the spread of viruses, such as Asian bird flu.          These viruses sometimes jump across species and infect humans to cause pandemics, such as the 1918 Spanish flu that killed up to 50 million people. A pandemic of a new strain called H5N1 could result in 100 million deaths, according to one World Heath Organisation estimate.          Widely used in research, the chicken is an important model for vaccine production and the study of embryology and development, as well as for research into the connection between viruses and some types of cancer.          The genome may some day allow poultry producers to know why certain chickens lay more eggs than others or why certain broiler chickens may have less fat. They then can identify commercial chickens with the same genetic predisposition to these traits.          But the team concluded that only two and a half per cent of the letters of the human genetic code can be matched to chicken DNA."
telegraph,19/05/2008 00:24,news,"A coalition of Britain's leading medical charities will urge MPs to approve stem cell research using human-animal hybrid embryos, as the Commons prepares for a landmark vote on the issue. The open letter, whose signatories include the Parkinson's Disease Society and   the British Heart Foundation, says that allowing the creation of hybrid   embryos could lead to crucial advances in the treatment of a range of   serious diseases. The Prime Minister added his support to the move, arguing that it had the   potential to save 'millions of lives'. Proposed new laws to permit the creation of hybrid embryos are contained   within the controversial Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, which will   be debated in the House of Commons over the next two days. They are opposed by religious leaders and pro-life groups, who claim that   hybrid embryos threaten the sanctity of human life. They insist scientists   should confine their research to adult rather than embryo stem cells. Tonight's vote will be the climax of the first in a series of highly-charged   debates on the biggest shake-up of Britain's embryology and fertility laws   for a generation. The most contentious vote, on whether to lower the   legal abortion limit from 24 weeks, will come tomorrow evening. Last night, a poll carried out Doctors.net, an online forum for registered   doctors, disclosed that more than half thought the abortion limit should be   lowered to 20 weeks. Tonight's vote is on the creation of hybrid embryos to enable further research   into a number of serious conditions. Under the process, the nuclei of human cells are inserted into animal eggs,   creating hybrid embryos which are allowed to grow for a few days. Stem cells can then be harvested and used to create brain, skin, heart and   other tissue for treating diseases before the embryos are destroyed. Gordon Brown, whose youngest son suffers from cystic fibrosis, one of the   conditions which scientists hope may be treated as a result of the research,   launched a passionate defence of the Bill, on which Labour MPs have a free   vote. In an article in the Observer, he described the research as an 'inherently   moral endeavour', adding: 'I believe we owe it to ourselves and   future generations to introduce these measures.'Religious leaders were unified in their unhappiness over the Bill. In a joint statement, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor   and Cardinal Sean Brady said: 'Not nearly enough time has been given to   discussing these issues and these questions require answers before and not   after legislation. Other emerging techniques hold potential for good,   without creating and destroying human embryos.' "
telegraph,16/11/2008 18:23,news,"A common sporting knee injury could be healed by a 'living bandage' developed from a patient's own stem cells. Torn meniscal cartilage, which affects about 80,000 men and women in Britain every year, is so difficult to repair that many professional sportsmen opt to have it removed altogether, risking osteoarthritis in later life.The cartilage acts as a shock absorbing cushion between the bones of the upper and lower leg and is frequently torn by twisting the leg during activities such as jogging, football, horse riding or skiing. Martin Petrov, a winger for Manchester City, is currently out of the game for four months as a result of the injury.Scientists at Bristol University have now managed to heal cartilage tissue in a laboratory with stem cells taken from a patient's own bone marrow. They placed the cells inside the tear, held in place by a spongy scaffold made from collagen, and found the stem cells brought the two pieces of torn cartilage together.Anthony Hollander, professor of rheumatology and tissue engineering and leader of the team that made the breakthrough, will now test out the treatment on their first patients. He said: 'The stem cells knit across the two sides of the lesion and cause a reuniting of the two sides. We hope that in the patient we can reunite the cartilage in a strong enough way to heal the wound completely.'Jonathan Webb, a rugby full-back who played 33 times for England, became a victim of a meniscal cartilage injury in 1989. Webb, 45, who became an orthopaedic surgeon specialising in sports injuries after retiring from professional rugby, had cartilage removed but still needs repeated surgery on his knee. He said the stem cell breakthrough offered 'the opportunity to rebuild the meniscal cartilage if it cannot be repaired. It may be that the professional sportsmen, who have the most to lose, will drive the technology forward'. "
telegraph,25/10/2001 00:01,news,"A COMPANY has created 100,000 genetically modified versions of a single weed to help to solve the mystery of how plants work, a German company revealed yesterday.The mutants grown by Metanomics, a Berlin-based company, mark the most systematic effort to unravel the secrets of plant metabolism.'We will hopefully be able to construct a plant on the drawing board 10 years from now,' said Prof Lothar Willmitzer, of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, Golm.Prof Willmitzer, who helped to set up the company three years ago, is one of the scientists who addressed a biotechnology meeting yesterday organised by the chemical company BASF.The number of genes that provide the entire genetic recipe of a plant is estimated to be about 25,000. By way of comparison, bacteria have 1,500, yeast has 6,000 and humans have about 34,000 genes.However, scientists know at most the function of only 20 per cent of these genes, which enable plants to grow in the desert, cope with salty soil and control the content of healthy oils, sugars, amino acids and vitamins.To elucidate the functions of the remaining 80 per cent, the plant factory is changing the genes in the weed one by one to explore their effects. Scientists hope to see which ones can be exploited in new GM varieties and which should be avoided because of potentially harmful effects.'Our goal is to investigate the function of all 25,000 genes in plants,' said Dr Arno Krotzky, managing director of Metanomics. 'This will require several hundred thousand experiments to investigate the complex interactions between genes, their functions and the regulation of these functions.'The company can also compare genetically modified plants with unmodified plants. 'This is an important part of the investigations into the safety of genetically modified plants,' said Dr Krotzky.Metanomics is a 'research assembly line'. More than 80 staff, including 23 scientists, prepare molecular tools for identifying genes. Such tools include fragments of genetic code that turn off genes and switches to turn them on.These tools are then introduced into plants, notably arabidopsis thaliana, the 'domestic pet' of plant biotechnology. The genetic blueprint of this weed is known. Moreover, the plant contains almost all the genes of crop plants, grows rapidly and produces huge numbers of progeny.Now Metanomics has created more than 100,000 different lines, that is genetic types, of arabidopsis. Just one gene is altered in each line to shed light on what it does. About 70,000 of the lines have a gene turned off and the remainder have genes turned on.Each year, Metanomics produces more than 20 million data files on the mutants, said Dr Krotzky. The study of a plant line might, for example, show that the level of a particular fatty acid in the plant has dropped.If a specific gene in this plant has been switched off, then that gene can clearly be identified as being responsible for the production of the specific fatty acid involved.In parallel with the metabolic analysis, the effects of the genes on other properties are measured, for example on appearance, performance and stress resistance.Genes for increasing stress tolerance have been identified, as have genes that influence the content of healthy fats and oils."
telegraph,9/2/2010 7:30,news,"A doctor alleged to have administered a stem cell therapy treatment in a ''wholly illegitimate, misleading and dishonest'' way to multiple sclerosis sufferers today told a disciplinary hearing the process in principle was ''worth a try''.A General Medical Council (GMC) hearing was earlier told nine men and women,   the majority of whom were suffering from the ''progressive and aggressive''   form of the disabling neurological disease, consulted Dutch-trained Dr   Robert Trossel in the desperate hope they could achieve a marked improvement   in their health.The sufferers who travelled to his clinic in Rotterdam raised thousands of   pounds to fund the therapy but there was ''no evidence'' that the substance   injected into them by Dr Trossel contained stem cells or that it was fit for   human use, the GMC earlier heard.In the majority of cases, the treatment administered by Dr Trossel had ''no   effect'' whatsoever on their condition, with those who felt they had   benefited returning to their previous state of ill health within a few   months, Tom Kark, counsel for the GMC, earlier said.Giving evidence in his defence on Monday, Dr Trossel told the hearing the   treatment of MS sufferers was ''not a primary target group'' for the therapy   and was ''one of the more difficult treatment groups''.However talking generally, he said: ''We would not decide not to. We said it   was worth a try. There is only one way to find out if it works for you. If   it works bless you...we would not turn you down.''He added if it gave the patient more time they would profit from the therapy.The hearing was told Dr Trossel, 55, was born in Saudi Arabia and initially   studied mechanical engineering before swapping to medicine at Leiden   University.He set up the Preventief Medisch Centrum (PMC) clinic in Rotterdam in the   early 1980s initially with a partner, after becoming interested in live cell   therapy through him.He opened another clinic in Alicante in Spain in the 1990s, but this was ''not   very active anymore'', he said.Dr Trossel registered with the GMC in London in 1992 following the break-up of   his marriage.Asked what proportion of patients received stem cell therapy at the Dutch   clinic during its 'hey day' in 2006, he said it was ''probably more than   30%''.He explained that he entered into a licensing contract with American firm   Biomark, then later Advanced Cell Therapeutics (ACT) at the end of 2003 to   provide stem cell therapy.The hearing was told ACT's bosses Laura Brown and Steve Van Rooyen later   underwent investigation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and   Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and were facing extradition   proceedings from South Africa to answer charges in the US.Dr Trossel told the hearing the vials of treatment would arrive in   consignments by courier from ACT to treat patients.Asked by his legal representative Robert Jay QC if he felt responsible for   patients referred from ACT, he replied: ''Of course, totally. I was   responsible as the doctor offering the treatment, explaining the treatment   and providing that treatment.''Mr Jay said the key issue of the case rested on whether the treatment of the   nine individuals was ''justifiable'' having regard to all the clinical   evidence.He said: ''We have heard that this substance may have been steroids or   something else altogether. That is an exercise in speculation.''The nine patients involved - James McCorrisken, Malcolm Pear, Stephen Murphy,   Anita Knowles, Rebecca Parker, Catherine Neal, Tracy Wagstaff, Karen Galley   and Deborah Sandford - are all willing to be identified in the case against   Dr Trossel.Dr Trossel injected a substance said to contain stem cells into all but two of   them, it is alleged.Dr Trossel denies a series of charges relating to all nine of the patients   including acting in a way that is inappropriate and exploitative of   vulnerable patients.In a 10th case, Dr Trossel has denied making false and misleading statements   to investigative journalist Barney Calman, who visited his private clinic in   central London in 2006 claiming to be a sufferer of Hodgkin's disease as   part of an investigation into alternative therapies for cancer.The case was adjourned."
dailymail,4/4/2015 22:04,health,"A face serum that claims to make skin genetically younger has gone on sale for the first time in Britain.TA-65 has the extraordinary effect of lengthening part of the body’s genetic material called telomeres, the protective ‘caps’ at the ends of DNA strands within the body’s cells that control their longevity, says TA Sciences, the American company that makes it.The Miami-based manufacturer also claims that users will find their faces are firmer and less lined within 12 weeks – although a one-month supply costs an astonishing £420.However, consumer groups in the US say little is known about the effect of reversing the natural cell-ageing process.In 2013 the Consumer Protection Coalition (CPC) – ‘a group of concerned citizens’ – wrote to the US Federal Trade Commission to highlight an animal study, published by Aging Cell, that showed that mice given food laced with TA-65 had a higher incidence of liver cancer. The serum is also available as a supplement, and the CPC warned that those who consume it face ‘substantial harm’, although there has been no official response to the complaint.The connection between cellular ageing and telomere length is backed by solid research. Cells replenish by reproducing – creating copies of themselves – in a process that happens constantly throughout the body.Telomeres, which have been likened to the plastic coatings on the ends of shoelaces, get shorter each time a cell copies itself.Ultimately, if they become too short, the DNA begins to degrade and cells lose their function. This is why these caps have been described as ‘the ageing clock in every cell’ – a marker of true biological age. Factors such as stress, smoking, obesity, poor sleep and nutrition all affect how quickly telomeres degrade.However, the process can be reversed by adopting a healthier lifestyle: an enzyme called telomerase, which is also produced by the body, is responsible for regrowth of telomeres.TA-65 contains cycloastragenol, a plant-derived molecule said to increase the activity in the human body of telomerase and reverse the ageing processes – although not extend lifespan – in mice.Skincare guru Jill Zander is selling the range and incorporating it into a facial treatment called The DNA Defender at her clinic in Esher, Surrey. She decided to offer the treatment after being impressed by the results herself.‘I think my immune system has improved and certainly my skin appears more youthful,’ she said.However, telomerase has also been linked to the development of some cancers. The disease is essentially the result of DNA mutations in cells resulting in them becoming ‘immortal’: reproducing in an uncontrolled way, causing tumours.Studies are being held into whether turning off telomerase activity in cells may be an effective way of treating the illness.TA Sciences has been criticised for only studying the efficacy of its own products.The three scientists who identified the significance of telomeres and telomerase – Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak – were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2009. Greider has publicly distanced herself from TA-65, saying that their research did not back up the claims.TA Sciences says TA-65 has recently been generally recognised as ‘safe’ by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).‘TA-65 has been on sale worldwide for almost eight years, with many thousands of people taking it on a regular basis without a single adverse effect report to the FDA including cancer,’ the firm adds.Marathon off the menu for Michel The folly of exercising when injured has been brought home to celebrity chef Michel Roux Jr, right, who has been forced to pull out of the London Marathon because of torn calf muscles.The 54-year-old admits: ‘I didn't realise how bad the injury was at first so I kept running until the pain became unbearable. If I had rested sooner, I may not have got two tears.‘There are three grades of tear, with one being minor and three being unbearable to walk on. One of mine is grade two, the other is grade one to two.‘It’s painful to walk on let alone run 26.2 miles on it. The doctors have told me that I can’t run on it for eight weeks at least.’Winning his two Michelin stars and running London’s luxury restaurant Le Gavroche have required Michel to show high levels of determination and resistance to pain, but this determination could have made his injury worse.‘I'm devastated that I won’t be raising money for my charity for visually impaired children, VICTA, but I hope that if I look after my body this year, then I will be back next year.’The book that saves livesA free book based on a TV advert that has helped save the lives of 36 children has been launched to encourage families to learn first-aid skills together.The St John Ambulance ‘Chokeables’ advert, which features the voices of actors David Walliams and Sir John Hurt, warns how everyday objects such as pen lids can be a choking hazard for children.Since its broadcast, families have contacted the charity to say using the correct technique – five back blows followed by up to five chest thrusts, as seen in the advert – had saved their child from choking.The e-book, called The Pen That Lost His Lid, is aimed at entertaining children and educating adult readers in first aid.It can be downloaded at sja.org.uk/pen-lid.App 'detects' dementiaScientists have developed an app to detect the early signs of dementia by listening to the way people speak. Problems with speech and memory can often be indicators of dementia, and of how advanced the disease is.The speech-analysis app asks patients to complete a series of verbal tasks. t then records the patient’s voice and analyses their performance, giving a reading of whether they have normal brain function, mild cognitive impairment or signs of dementia.A trial involving 55 healthy patients and dementia patients showed the app gave accurate readings of their mental function. Designers are fine-tuning it before it’s hoped it will be available for use by doctors and the public.Tomatoes gain their red colouring from the antioxidant compound lycopene, shown in studies to protect prostate, skin and heart health. Now researchers have found that lycopene – also found in red peppers, watermelon and pink grapefruit, but not strawberries – may also help safeguard against kidney cancer. Lycopene consumption has been linked to a third lower incidence of the disease in post-menopausal women. The study, conducted by Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, Michigan, tracked more than 96,000 women from 1993 to 2013.Canadian outdoor experts Arc’teryx – whose products are loved by Hollywood hiking fans Jennifer Garner and Jeremy Renner – have launched their first footwear range.They feature seamless (so truly waterproof) moulded rubber outer ‘shells’, which are paired with breathable Gore-Tex woven booties that slip inside.The idea is borrowed from alpine climbing boots and means that if your inners become wet, you just take off the outers, and the fabric then dries easily.They are extremely eye-catching and, like much of the apparel from the high-performance brand, the boots are just as likely be worn on the commute to work.

telegraph,12/10/2011 19:00,news,"A genetic fault responsible for a fatal liver condition has been completely corrected by Cambridge scientists in a stem cell experiment which could bring patient-specific treatments closer to reality.Using stem cells engineered from human skin, scientists were able to correct a   genetic mutation which leads to liver and lung disease, turn the cells into   healthy liver cells and use them to replace damaged tissue.The research, conducted in test tubes and on mice, has yet to be tested on   humans but could lead to a new range of specialised cell treatments.Scientists believe that the ability to mend defective genes in stem cells,   which create every type of tissue in the body, would enable them to tackle   mutations that cause a wide range of diseases.Researchers from Cambridge and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute targeted a   gene which protects against inflammation in the liver by producing a certain   protein. In patients with a mutation in the gene – a disorder which affects about one   in 2,000 northern European people – the protein becomes trapped in the   liver, and leads to cirrhosis of the liver and lung emphysema. Using 'molecular scissors' the scientists were able to cut away the   mutated section of DNA from a stem cell and replace it with a corrected   version, according to a report in the Nature journal. The stem cells went on to generate liver cells which contained normal protein   levels, indicating that the previously faulty gene was now working normally.Prof Allan Bradley, director emeritus of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,   said: 'Our systems leave behind no trace of the genetic manipulation,   save for the gene correction. “These are early steps but, if this technology can be taken into treatment, it   will offer great possible benefits for patients.” "
telegraph,29/06/2002 00:01,news,"A girl has been saved from a life in confinement in a sterile environment after a pioneering cure for immune deficiency using gene therapy.Salsabil, a Palestinian, was born into a family where immune system weaknesses had already killed one child and afflicted another. She lacked an enzyme called adenosine draminase (ADA), one essential for a working immune system.Her case has given hope of finding a cure for Aids using gene therapy. 'The trial is already approved by the Italian authorities and is expected to start in mid-July,' said Prof Claudio Bordignon, of the San Raffaele Institute for Gene Therapy, in Milan.It also has the potential to cure other genetic diseases, such as Gaucher's, and diseases caused by enzyme deficiency.The success in treating Salsabil, whose surname has not been released, was down to a method of transferring the ADA gene into cells, and a way to 'make space' in her bone marrow for these cells, report Prof Borignon and Prof Shimon Slavin of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centre, Jerusalem, in the journal Science. Her bone marrow was transformed from what doctors called an 'immune cell desert' into a breeding ground for infection-fighting cells.At seven months old, Salsabil, named after the river of paradise in the Koran, received a mild treatment to suppress her abnormal cells, providing a biological advantage for the genetically corrected cells. Then, the team used a GM virus to introduce the missing ADA gene into stem cells, parent cells that had been purified from her bone marrow, before reintroducing them.Within a few weeks the number of white blood cells - lymphocytes - in the blood had risen dramatically and the toxic products in the blood, which would normally kill the lymphocytes, had declined.Within a month, Salsabil was out of isolation and went home.Nearly two years after the gene therapy, her blood cells are functioning normally. Even after exposure to chicken pox, Salsabil's antibodies developed spontaneously and she did not develop any sign of the disease.Since this first-of-a-kind procedure was performed, two other children have received a similar protocol from the Italian team, apparently with a similar success rate.Earlier American attempts to treat ADA deficiency were 'scientifically successful' but did not have a notable impact on the patient's condition because only a minute fraction of the genetically abnormal bone marrow was repaired, Prof Slavin said.The US patients still required expensive treatment with an ADA replacement to survive."
telegraph,1/11/2010 16:33,news,"A great-grandmother who lost her sight and flew to China for stem cell treatment claims she can now see for the first time in 18 months. Dorothy Leach says she can make out faces, shapes and colours and is hoping to   see her two-year-old great grandson. However, an expert in ophthalmology warned that the treatment was untested and   that she may have put herself at risk in an “exploitative, money making   exercise”. Mrs Leach, 76, lost her sight in February last year and was diagnosed with   giant cell arteritis, an inflammatory disease of blood vessels. She was told by doctors in the UK that nothing could be done but she found out   about Qingdao Chengyang People's Hospital which offered an alternative. Mrs Leach, from Hardwicke, near Gloucester, and the local community managed to   raise the £16,000 to pay for the cost of the treatment. This involved stem cell fluid taken from umbilical cords of new born babies   being injected twice into her right eye and six times into her hands over a   six week period. She also received daily acupuncture and “wave therapy” which sends electric   pulses through the brain. Mrs Leach says she now has good days where she can make out shapes and images   and bad days where she sees little more than shadows. She was told it will take six to 12 months to establish how successful the   treatment has been. “The other day I saw a crow on the fence in my garden and had to check with   people that I could actually see it but I did see it. It is amazing. “The doctors said it could take another six months to a year before my sight   gets as good as it will be, but it is much better already. It was definitely   worth it.' She hopes to see her great grandson Chris for the first time whom she has not   seen because his parents are in the Army. Her daughter Vicky, who accompanied Mrs Leach to China, said: “Mum sight is so   much better than it was. “We are really pleased with it so far and hope it will get better over the   next few months as the stem cells start to work.” However, Professor Robin Ali, professor of human molecular genetics at the   Institute of Ophthalmology at University College London, was highly   sceptical about the treatment. “It sounds like a classic fraudulent treatment that’s only available in India   and China. It just capitalises on the excitement around stem cell research   at the moment. “There is no evidence that this treatment is effective and no validation   whatsoever.” Prof Ali said any improvement may be psychological: “Sometime pricking the eye   with a needle can be effective and there have been reports of short term   benefits. “But the chances are it is much more likely to do harm rather than good – it   is very exploitative. “It doesn’t make sense to think there is this fantastic treatment in places   like China and India but it is not available in the UK or the US. “We are at least five to 10 years from a clinical trial in this country and   there is no regulation in China. “This is just a money making exercise – if people are desperate they will feel   they have nothing to lose. It is potentially very dangerous.” "
telegraph,2/12/2008 19:42,news,"A major advance in treatment for millions of heart patients has been heralded by revolutionary stem cell surgery, developed by a British-based team of scientists. The researchers at Imperial College London are perfecting a technique to rebuild a heart severely damaged and scarred by disease or cardiac arrest.They have discovered a way to extract, grow in the laboratory and then graft on a patient's own muscle-building cells which then can be used to patch up the heart and increase its pumping power.Eventually it could end the need for transplants, revolutionise heart surgery and reduce the 238,000 lives lost every year to heart disease, the UK's biggest killer.What is more, it could increase the quality of life for the million or so people who suffer a heart attack every year.The world-leading research, which is being led by the American Professor Michael Schneider, was last night awarded The Medical Futures Innovation Award, otherwise known as a medical Oscar.Dr Nicholas Boon, President of the British Cardiovascular Society and one of the judges for the awards, said:  'This could transform the care for patients who have had heart attacks or have heart disease. 'Because the cell therapy uses a patient's own cells, it negates the risks or complications associated with other treatment options such as rejection linked to transplantation.'Andy Goldberg, an orthopaedic surgeon who founded the awards, said: 'It is early stages but if this research does what it says on the tin it will be absolutely massive.'It will be the biggest breakthrough in heart disease treatment.'In a cardiac arrest, heart muscle cells die but existing treatments do not repair the damage to the muscle and have a limited effect on heart function.At the moment, there is no cure because the heart cannot heal itself, although medication can ease the symptoms.  A last resort is a transplant which is incredibly risky and not always successful.The team at the Cardiovascular Science at the National Heart and Lung Institute have discovered a way to rejuvenate hearts using a specialist versions of heart stem cells - known as 'progenitor' cells - found in small quantities in human hearts.Professor Schneider was among the first to show that stem or 'progenitor' cells exist in heart muscle, and then developed techniques to purify progenitor cells from a patient's heart and grow them in the laboratory.Naturally there are only around 300 of these special cells for every million normal heart cells. The team thinks they are just there to help the heart recover from normal wear and tear.The research team has solved the problem, however, by isolating the special cells from human hearts and cloning them in the lab. Then, using a proprietary, non-toxic technique, they have multiplied them.So far, they have tested the heart cells successfully on mice and found that they do cause new heart tissue to form.Professor Schneider, who holds the British Heart Foundation's Simon Marks Chair, said the team now wants to test human heart progenitor cells on pigs, which have similar anatomy to humans.  Human trials could follow in two to three years.'It's very exciting - and we could be doing human trials within three years,' said Professor Schneider.'This is pretty cutting edge stuff, In an ideal world, we could have a situation where patients with heart disease have their disease reversed as healthy tissue grows back.'We hope that at the very least this will make the lives of those suffering from heart disease easier - allow them to get up stairs and do more things in their daily lives.'The more ambitious hope is that will eventually keep people out of hospital and make them live longer.'Last month, it was revealed British doctors helped to perform the world's first transplant of a whole organ grown from stem cells.Surgeons replaced the damaged windpipe of Claudia Castillo, a 30-year-old mother of two, with one created from stem cells grown in a laboratory at Bristol University. Professor Martin Birchall, from the University of Bristol, who was involved in the transplant, said: 'This does appear to be an incredible step forward in stem cell research. 'It is extremely exciting. It is a massive step forward to be able to grow functioning heart muscles and to be able to beat in time. 'This would open the way to replacing parts of the heart that have died after a heart attack, that would seem like the biggest potential market.' "
telegraph,8/7/2002 14:44,news,"A man suffering from leukaemia has become the first adult in Britain to undergo a life-saving bone marrow transplant using stem cells. Stephen Knox, 31, underwent the treatment after being given just months to live. The procedure has previously only been performed on children with serious blood disorders.Professor Stephen Proctor who developed the procedure used stem cell blood from discarded placentas and umbilical cords to treat Mr Knox. Mr Knox, a nurse from Middleton-St-George, Co Durham, underwent the operation after various chemotherapy sessions earlier this year failed to cure the disease. Prof Proctor, based at Newcastle Hospital Trust's Haematology Unit, and at Newcastle University, discovered a way to bulk up the stem cells using blood which does not match the sufferer's.Mr Knox was given treatment to kill off his own bone marrow and then injected with the mixed cord blood which has grown into new bone marrow.Prof Proctor said it was still early days regarding the pioneering bone marrow operation - but Mr Knox had responded well to the treatment.Mr Knox, who underwent the procedure in February and is now in remission, is still recovering in hospital.Prof Proctor said: 'This treatment was his only hope.'Stephen is progressing much better than we thought he would and the transplant has worked much better and more quickly than we expected.'It's a really exciting development and opens up huge possibilities. 'It has been carried out 23 times in the UK on children but never with an adult.'Until now the small quantities of blood collected could not be used for adults because they yield only a few drops of the vital stem cells which, when transplanted, grow into new bone marrow.Prof Proctor and his transplant team have spent years researching how to bulk up the stem cells, which do match the sufferer's own tissue type, by using cord blood which does not.Cord blood is blood that is taken from the placenta which supplies the baby with oxygen and nutrients while it is in the womb.After the baby is born, midwives clamp the umbilical cord and insert a needle close to the placenta so the blood can be collected and after it has been screened it is frozen and can be kept for up to 10 years.The cord blood bank in Newcastle upon Tyne is one of just two centres in the country with the other in north London."
telegraph,22/05/2005 00:01,sport,"A new gene therapy technique, which is more than twice as effective as steroids at boosting muscle, will soon be given the go-ahead for testing on humans. After that, doctors say, it is ''inevitable'' that athletes will try to use it to enhance their performance.          The technique was developed by Professor Geoff Goldspink of the Royal Free Hospital in London to combat muscular dystrophy, a degenerative condition that affects about 30,000 people in the UK.           Professor Goldspink discovered that injected genetic material could increase production of a protein called mechano growth factor, or MGF, which boosts muscle mass and improves the muscle's ability to repair itself.           By cloning the gene and injecting it into mice, Professor Goldspink recorded an increase in muscle strength of 25 per cent in three weeks. Given that steroids can manage, at best, a 10 per cent increase over 10 weeks, some doctors fear there will be considerable implications for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).          ''In terms of performance enhancement and sport, it's the holy grail,'' Professor Goldspink said.           He claims to have avoided the side-effects that have so far dogged gene therapy. In the past, genetic material designed to boost production of one type of cell has ended up boosting cancerous growths.          This is why tests on humans have been slow in coming and why many have scoffed at the possibility of gene therapy affecting sport. Not any more though. Goldsmith says he is about to sign a multi-million dollar deal with pharmaceutical giant Novartis to start testing the technique on humans.          Professor Lee Sweeney of the University of Pennsylvania is working on a similar project to help sufferers of muscular dystrophy. His group uses gene therapy to stimulate a different growth hormone called IGF-1 and he confirmed that a human trial is likely to begin in the United States within the year. ''Once you start testing on humans, you'll get rogue doctors in certain countries offering this thing for profit,'' he said. ''There's simply too much money to be made.''           Even more troubling for WADA is that, unlike steroids, injecting genes to stimulate MGF or IGF-1 may be undetectable. IGF-1 produced by injecting genetic material is indistinguishable from IGF-1 the body produces naturally through resistance training. The introduced genetic material is detectable but because it is confined to the muscle, testing would involve extracting an actual lump of muscle from every competitor. So, short of taking a pound of flesh, WADA must look elsewhere.          ''WADA approached me about developing a test but I'm deeply sceptical,'' said Professor Sweeney. 'You can only test for something if it's in the blood and my job is to make sure it doesn't get into the blood as this will carry it to areas it's not wanted. If we do our jobs properly, it'll be impossible to detect.''          What that means is that WADA are limited to looking for indirect effects. One of their latest research projects is a test for 'protein fingerprints' or abnormal patterns of protein that could only be caused by injected genetic material.          ''We're looking for something out of the ordinary, like cells suddenly processing growth hormone when they shouldn't,'' said chief scientist Phil Teale. ''I'd envisage that within three years we could detect relevant patterns. But how quickly that translates into an actual testing methodology is hard to say.''          ''It's impossible to say whether we will have a fully working test in time for the 2008 Olympics,'' said Frederic Donve, WADA's media relations manager. ''We have commissioned five research projects but we can't say when they will produce results.''          A spokesman for UK Sport agreed that although they've ''identified gene doping as a priority'' they have no idea when such a test is likely to be operational.          Some believe this is not a battle worth fighting. Andy Miah, author of Genetically Modified Athletes, argues that testing for genes would not only be futile but unethical.          ''The impetus to find new methods of enhancement is not going to stop,'' said Miah. ''We need to draw a line under drug use and consider gene modification as a separate technology. It is a legitimate use of a technology that can improve humanity, not make it less human.''          Whether we try to test for gene doping or not, one subject on which all parties agree is that if athletes aren't using these techniques already they will be soon."
telegraph,4/4/2015 14:09,finance,"A new investment model will see high net worths sponsor ground-breaking research to wipe out the world's diseases A small Swiss company has created a novel investment model, where the rewards are far greater than anything financial could bring.  Rather, investors are also paid with technology advancements that could save the lives of their nearest and dearest, or solve their own chronic health issues.  The Novagenesis Foundation and its commercial arm, Ophiuchus Technologies, are pioneers in a niche field of stem cell research. The organisation has created a patented technology that allows bone marrow cells to be taken from an individual, reprogrammed, and reinserted into the body.  The technology is based on the salamander lizard, which can regrow limbs and organs when they are damaged. According to Jørgen Thorball, managing director of Ophiuchus, the company has the capability to heal – and in some cases cure – a variety of health issues.  In Roman mythology, Ophiuchus, also known by his more common name Asclepius, learnt the secrets of keeping death at bay.   The organisations are raising capital through XOventure, which finds funding and support for early-stage life sciences and biotechnology firms.  Ed Cappabianca, senior partner at XOventure, explains that cures are usually avoided by traditional investors, such as venture capitalists, because once someone is cured, the product is no longer required, which limits its scalability.  “What investors want is a single chemical, something like Viagra, that you can scale and sell for a lot of money,” he says. “Once you start taking it, you tend to keep taking it. It doesn’t solve a problem, so you create a customer for life.   Last year Pfizer made $1.7bn from Viagra sales  “The same is true of many treatments for diabetes. The focus is on creating medicines that allow people to lead healthy, happy lives – as long as you keep taking them.”  Novagenesis has been funded by high-net-worth individuals who are motivated by altruistic or personal reasons to further this kind of research. The not-for-profit foundation has already raised “many millions” to take its technology into clinical trials, and Ophiuchus is aiming to close a £7m investment round.  The company could later also go down the crowdfunding route, Cappabianca claimed, allowing armchair investors to invest in the firm. “The early data will help us to secure the next round of funding as we don’t want to IPO too early,” says Cappabianca. “The stock price will be driven up as people hear about us and the last thing you want is to have a steep valuation when you’re looking to raise more money.  “We want to raise money at a lower price, giving early investors a return, but leaving something on the table for the next guy. That way we can keep going back to the well.”  One private investor, Serge Richard, who manages the Swiss branch of a global estate planning business, said he was attracted to the proposition because of its human dimension. “I believe it will create progress for humanity as a whole, not just for a few people,” he says, “Everyone knows somebody who has been hurt in an accident and left disabled or brain damaged and that could all be avoided with this technology.”  Most of Novagenesis’s backing has been provided by a single donor with progressive multiple sclerosis, a form of the disease where symptoms get continually worse over time rather than having relapses and remissions. Cappabianca also got involved with the project because of personal reasons. “A friend has progressive MS,” he says. “I don’t know if we’ll solve the problem in time for Charlie, but it is why I wanted to help raise the money.”  Ophiuchus’s work is currently focused on spinal cord injuries. The foundation’s founder, Jan-Eric Ahlfors, who invented the new technology, chose to target the most severe cases of paraplegics in order to leave no doubt that the science and product concept was robust.  “Most researchers go for the low-hanging fruit,” says Thorball. “But it actually makes sense to try and solve the most difficult problems first because then you know the technology works.”  Ophiuchus has embarked on its first human clinical trials. The trials are being undertaken in Russia, supported by the country’s leading health body, the Federal Research Clinical Centre of Federal Medical & Biological Agency. There will be 30 patients in the current trial.  Ahlfors is working on the core technology in a private lab in Montreal, Canada, and will publish a paper on his research when the current set of clinical trials are complete.  Novagenesis has kept its research under wraps to avoid creating false hope among the paraplegic community, and sufferers of other diseases, who could eventually be helped by the technology. “We didn’t want to create hype before there was a product,” says Thorball. “The science is interesting but it’s not relevant for the patient, only products are relevant. When science says we can cure something and there is no product, what does the patient do?”  Unlike other stem cell methodologies, Ahlfors is focusing on an “autologous” process, which ensures that the cells are not rejected by the patient, unlike experiments using cells harvested from other sources.  One barrier to growth is that different governments have varying laws on whether an individual can have their own cells harvested. This is not currently possible in the UK or US.  “It seems ridiculous to tell people that they cannot have their own cells, but the regulations are very different depending where you are in the world,” says Thorball.  Other companies have allegedly made headway in stem cell research. Last year, the BBC’s Panorama programme followed the treatment of one paralysed man in Poland, who was filmed walking again for the first time after his accident. Thorball warned against taking claims made by stem cell researchers that are based on a single selected patient.  “In that case, the spinal cord was not severed, just damaged,” says Thorball. “He already had some ability, so the regrowth is a matter of discussion.”  Ophiuchus will work hard towards rolling out treatments in private clinics within two years. The company is aiming to create a mass-market product within a decade. Investor Richard said: “All the insurance companies will begin covering the treatment because even though it will be expensive, it will be much less expensive than treating people for the rest of their lives for a disease, or keeping them in a wheelchair.” "

It means that only those likely to succeed are implanted, speeding up the   process and reducing the number that end in miscarriage or birth defects. If the 24-hour tests show that a couple are unlikely ever to have a baby   through IVF, it will also spare them the heartache of spending more time and   money on further cycles. It could one day mean that almost 100 per cent of normal IVF pregnancies lead   to healthy babies. Currently only 70 per cent make it after basic genetic   testing and developing for five days in the lab.The novel technique is being taken seriously by the scientific community and   the study that explains it has won a prize from the US Society for Assisted   Reproductive Technologies.Dr Dagan Wells from Oxford University, who led the research, said: “I think it   offers the possibility of enhancing success rates of IVF, allowing couples   to get to the point of having a baby more rapidly with fewer cycles, and   avoiding the heartbreak of miscarriage or terminating a pregnancy because of   serious disorders. “It’s particularly troubling when you meet a couple who struggle for years   with IVF to obtain a pregnancy that’s desperately longed-for, then finally   they get one after all that time and expense and it miscarries because it’s   chromosomally abnormal or has serious defects, and they face having to   choose to terminate a pregnancy they really want. That’s an awful situation   and this won’t entirely eliminate that but this kind of process will reduce   that.” Overall only one in three IVF pregnancies, in which eggs are taken from a   woman who has trouble conceiving and fertilised in the lab before being   returned to her body, leads to a live birth and experts believe this is   because many genetic defects are missed.In an existing test established by Dr Wells and now carried out in 15 clinics   worldwide, embryos that have reached the critical “blastocyst” stage after   growing for five days in the lab have a handful of cells removed so their   chromosomes can be counted. Only one of those that has the requisite 46 is then transferred to the   mother-to-be, almost doubling the chances of it leading to a live birth   since chromosome abnormalities are the main cause of miscarriage. But even then only two-thirds of embryos with normal chromosomes succeed, so a   more comprehensive test has been developed to identify further causes of   failure. It will be set out this week at the annual conference of the   American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Orlando, Florida. Under the new analysis, scientists also look at two different markers for a   healthy embryo - the appearance of telomeres and the number of mitochondria. Telomeres are the “caps” on the ends of chromosomes and are shorter when   damaged, while mitochondria are the power sources for cells. Dr Wells said: “Chromosomes are a big part of the story but they are not the   be all and end all.“There are many aspects of biology that make up a viable pregnancy. “Two other good candidates that may affect embryo competency are telomeres and   mitochondria.”He said embryos “don’t all have the long, beautiful telomeres we might expect”.“That might have an impact on their viability and long-term health.“It is also possible that the number of mitochondria in the cells of an embryo   might also be indicative of their chances of producing a pregnancy.“Embryos that don’t do so well tend to have an abnormally high number of   mitochondria.” Dr Wells will start carrying out the test for British women within weeks,   although like the existing analysis it costs about£2,000 and is not   available on the NHS. Within a year he hopes to obtain results from the first tests to establish   exactly how telomere length and mitochondria levels affect birth chances. That could then mean that more unviable embryos are screened out, increasing   the success rate in a single cycle of IVF and giving childless couples a   better idea of whether or not they will ever be able to have a baby. Tony Rutherford, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said: “This   exciting novel technique is taking the molecular assessment of the embryo to   a new level, and clearly is an important tool for research into embryo   health.  “Selecting the right embryo for replacement in a cost effective, reproducible   manner potentially has enormous benefits for patients, clinics and the   health service overall.  “Of course, as with any new technology, appropriate clinical studies are   required to ensure that the benefits are realised. “The difficulty we face is making sure adequate funding is made available to   allow this new technique to be assessed fully before it enters clinical   practice.”"
telegraph,6/12/2005 0:01,news,"A new way of inhibiting prostate cancer cells has been found that could prevent the disease returning after treatment.          Scientists have shown that they can identify the tumour stem cells that make up one in 1,000 of cancer cells.          Existing treatments for prostate cancer can act in the same way as a gardener who cuts down a weed but leaves the roots intact, resulting in the disease recurring within two years.          The discovery was made by Norman Maitland, professor of molecular biology at the Yorkshire Cancer Research Unit (YCR) at the University of York, and his colleague Dr Anne Collins.          Prof Maitland said: 'For the first time we have been able to extract these stem cells from prostate cancers, and we are the only people in the world who have been able to propagate them in the laboratory.          'It's the most exciting thing I have seen in 10 years, but we don't want to give people false hope, because the therapies for treating tumour stem cells have still to be developed.          He added: 'We are beginning to understand what they look like.          'We can now investigate specific therapies for killing the roots, rather than the leaves, of prostate cancers.'          Elaine King, chief executive of YCR, said: 'This is a definite step forward in the understanding of tumour stem cells.          'This latest discovery will allow YCR scientists to build upon this framework of knowledge, in the hope of developing effective treatments in the future.'          The research could also have implications for the treatment of other cancers. Tumour stem cells also occur in breast and colon cancers, as well as in brain tumours.          The findings were published in Cancer Research, the journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.          Chris Hiley, head of policy and research at the Prostate Cancer Charity, said: 'This is an exciting development, because in the long term it could offer men with prostate cancer a treatment that could give them a definitive all-clear.          'However, like so much science, men should be aware that it will be many years before this research may develop into a treatment doctors can give.'"
telegraph,5/6/2014 19:51,news,"A person's entire immune system can be rejuvenated by fasting for as little as three days as it triggers the body to start producing new white blood cells, a study suggests Fasting for as little as three days can regenerate the entire immune system,   even in the elderly, scientists have found in a breakthrough described as 'remarkable'. Although fasting diets have been criticised by nutritionists for being   unhealthy, new research suggests starving the body kick-starts stem cells   into producing new white blood cells, which fight off infection. Scientists at the University of Southern California say the discovery could be   particularly beneficial for people suffering from damaged immune systems,   such as cancer patients on chemotherapy. It could also help the elderly whose immune system becomes less effective as   they age, making it harder for them to fight off even common diseases. The researchers say fasting 'flips a regenerative switch' which   prompts stem cells to create brand new white blood cells, essentially   regenerating the entire immune system.  'It gives the 'OK' for stem cells to go ahead and begin proliferating   and rebuild the entire system,' said Prof Valter Longo, Professor of   Gerontology and the Biological Sciences at the University of California.  'And the good news is that the body got rid of the parts of the system   that might be damaged or old, the inefficient parts, during the fasting. “Now, if you start with a system heavily damaged by chemotherapy or ageing,   fasting cycles can generate, literally, a new immune system.' Prolonged fasting forces the body to use stores of glucose and fat but also   breaks down a significant portion of white blood cells. During each cycle of fasting, this depletion of white blood cells induces   changes that trigger stem cell-based regeneration of new immune system   cells. In trials humans were asked to regularly fast for between two and four days   over a six-month period. Scientists found that prolonged fasting also reduced the enzyme PKA, which is   linked to ageing and a hormone which increases cancer risk and tumour   growth.  'We could not predict that prolonged fasting would have such a   remarkable effect in promoting stem cell-based regeneration of the   hematopoietic system,' added Prof Longo.  'When you starve, the system tries to save energy, and one of the things   it can do to save energy is to recycle a lot of the immune cells that are   not needed, especially those that may be damaged,' Dr Longo said.  'What we started noticing in both our human work and animal work is that   the white blood cell count goes down with prolonged fasting. Then when you   re-feed, the blood cells come back. So we started thinking, well, where does   it come from?' Fasting for 72 hours also protected cancer patients against the toxic impact   of chemotherapy.  'While chemotherapy saves lives, it causes significant collateral damage   to the immune system. The results of this study suggest that fasting may   mitigate some of the harmful effects of chemotherapy,' said co-author   Tanya Dorff, assistant professor of clinical medicine at the USC Norris   Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital.  'More clinical studies are needed, and any such dietary intervention   should be undertaken only under the guidance of a physician.”  'We are investigating the possibility that these effects are applicable   to many different systems and organs, not just the immune system,'   added Prof Longo. However, some British experts were sceptical of the research. Dr Graham Rook, emeritus professor of immunology at University College London,   said the study sounded 'improbable'. Chris Mason, Professor of Regenerative Medicine at UCL, said: “There is some   interesting data here. It sees that fasting reduces the number and size of   cells and then re-feeding at 72 hours saw a rebound. “That could be potentially useful because that is not such a long time that it   would be terribly harmful to someone with cancer. “But I think the most sensible way forward would be to synthesize this effect   with drugs. I am not sure fasting is the best idea. People are better eating   on a regular basis.”Dr Longo added: “There is no evidence at all that fasting would be dangerous   while there is strong evidence that it is beneficial. “I have received emails from hundreds of cancer patients who have combined   chemo with fasting, many with the assistance of the oncologists. “Thus far the great majority have reported doing very well and only a few have   reported some side effects including fainting and a temporary increase in   liver markers. Clearly we need to finish the clinical trials, but it looks   very promising.” 'Fast diet' promises weight loss, but is this fad unhealthy? "
telegraph,15/12/2008 17:30,news,"A review of the greatest scientific achievements, discoveries and breakthroughs of 2008.Stem   cell organ transplant British doctors announced in November that they had helped perform the world's   first transplant of an organ grown from stem cells, signalling a significant   medical breakthrough. Surgeons replaced the damaged windpipe of Claudia Castillo, a 30-year-old   mother of two, with one created from stem cells grown in a laboratory at   Bristol University. Because the new windpipe was made from cells taken from   Ms Castillo's body, using a process called tissue engineering, she did not   need powerful organ rejection drugs. Avoiding the use of these drugs means she will not be at an increased risk of   cancer and other diseases, unlike other transplant patients. Five months   after the operation, she is living normally and is able to look after her   children again. Stem cells are 'master cells'' that can be manipulated in a laboratory to   become any other cell in the body. Scientists predicted that within 20 years   surgeons could replace hearts with laboratory-grown organs. The technique   would 'revolutionise'' surgery, they claimed, with the potential to   save thousands of lives. Teddy   bears in orbitThe Russians started their space flight programme by putting a dog into orbit. The Americans used monkeys. But in a world first, Britain sent four teddy   bears into the stratosphere on December 5. Two of the toys - named MAT and KMS, using the first initials of the pupils   who made their space suits - were photographed more than 18 miles above the   Earth in a four-hour flight. The teddies floated in temperatures of -31F (-3C) strapped to a weather   balloon made by Cambridge University's space fligh science club. A laptop on   the rig attached to a webcam captured the images of the bears nearly   100,000ft above Earth. The flight was launched from Churchill College. Pupils from nearby Parkside   and Coleridge community colleges helped by creating space suits to stop the   teddies from freezing solid. After completing their mission, the pair   parachuted down and made a soft landing near Ipswich, just 50 miles from   their launch pad. Astronaut   loses her tool bagA female astronaut accidentally let go her tool bag go during a spacewalk in   November- and watched helplessly as it floated away. Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper dropped the bag while repairing a solar panel on   the International Space Station. She was heard to mumble: 'Oh great.   Lost bag.'Mission Control told Heidemarie, part of the crew on the space shuttle   Endeavour, to carry on and share a colleague's toolbag as they worked on a   jammed joint. The toolbag is said to be one of the largest items lost in   space by an astronaut and is still floating in orbit. Britain   allows human animal hybrids Britain became one of a handful of countries allowing the creation of   human-animal hybrids following a landmark vote by MPs in October. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill was passed overwhelmingly, by 355   votes to 129. The Bill will push back the boundaries of science by allowing radical embryo   research including planting human cells into an egg taken from an animal,   usually a rabbit. Pro-life MPs warned that the step could lead to the   creation of half-human, half-ape 'humanzees'' or 'minotaurs'' - a   claim denied by the Department of Health. Hybrids - called 'admixed embryos'' by the scientific community - are   banned in at least 21 countries, but scientists believe that they could be   used to find cures for dozens of serious conditions, from heart disease to   dementia. MPs backed the Bill after being told that it could revolutionise the lives of   hundreds of thousands of people, bringing to a close one of the most bitter   parliamentary wrangles of recent years. GM   animal organs for human transplantHearts and kidneys from genetically modified pigs could be transplanted into   humans within a decade, a leading scientist revealed in NovemberLord Winston, a fertility expert at Imperial College London, told a press   conference he is developing a GM pig that he believes could solve the   shortage of organs for transplant patients. The pigs, which could eventually also donate other organs such as the liver,   will be bred so that transplants will not be rejected by the human body. Once created, the 'donor strain'' should be able to reproduce normally,   producing an almost limitless and cheap supply of organs. A shortage of appropriate donors means that around 500 people die every year   in Britain while waiting for a transplant. Scientists   propose warp drive Two physicists boldly went where no reputable scientists should go and devised   a scheme to travel faster than the speed of light. The advance they said could mean that Star Trek fantasies of interstellar   civilisations and voyages powered by warp drive are now no longer the   exclusive domain of science fiction writers. Dr Gerald Cleaver, the associate professor of physics at Baylor University,   Texas, and Richard Obousy have come up with a twist on an idea to produce a   warp drive that they believe can travel faster than the speed of light,   without breaking the laws of physics. In their scheme, published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary   Society in August, a starship could 'warp'' space so that it shrinks   ahead of the vessel and expands behind it. By pushing the departure point   many light years backwards while simultaneously bringing distant stars and   other destinations closer, the warp drive effectively transports the   starship from place to place at faster-than-light speeds. All this extraordinary feat would require, says the study, is for scientists   to harness a mysterious cosmic antigravity force, called dark energy. Phoenix   Mars lander reports from MarsCheers rang out at Nasa's jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena, California,   in May as word reached Earth that the space agency's latest mission to   explore Mars had touched down safely. The Phoenix Mars Lander, a robotic probe designed to investigate whether the   planet's subterranean ice ever supported life, successfully pulled off a   hair-raising descent that had mission controllers 170 million miles away   anxiously holding their breath. During the so-called 'seven minutes of terror'', the final moments of the   craft's hazardous plunge to the Martian surface, the three-legged probe   activated its heat shield, deployed a parachute and used 12 rockets to slow   from 13,000mph to just 5mph. With little room for error, there was significant risk the £212 million   project could end the same way that more than half of previous missions to   Mars have done - in failure. But in the final hours before the scheduled arrival, engineers at JPL remained   upbeat about their chances of success, citing the clear weather and fact   that Phoenix was on course to touch down on target in the arctic plains near   the planet's north pole. Their optimism was borne out when mission controllers received a signal at   12.53am BST telling them the Phoenix had landed 15 minutes earlier, the time   it took the signal to travel the distance to Earth. Over the next few months the robotic laboratory send back unprecendented   images and confirmed the presence of water on the Red Planet. It eventually died on November 2, two months after its expected survival date. Sir   Stephen Hawking's ChronophageSir Stephen Hawking unveiled a new clock - known as the time-eater - outside   one of Britain's most prestigious colleges in September.Unlike conventional timepieces, the extraordinary 'Chronophage' at   Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, does not use hands or digital numerals to   show the time. Instead, it relies on a mechanical monster - part demonic grasshopper, part   locust - that rocks back and forth along a golden disc, edged like a   lizard's spine. By a complex feat of engineering, its movement triggers blue   flashing lights that dart across the clockface, letting students know if   they are late for a lecture. About two metres in diameter, the clock is made from discs of stainless steel   and plated with 24-carat gold. With each slackening of the monster's jaw,   and release of its claws, another second is devoured. Each new hour is   signalled by the rattle of a chain on an unseen coffin to remind passers-by   of their mortality. The £ 1 million invention is a tribute to John Harrison, the world's greatest   clockmaker, who solved the problem of longtitude in the 18th century. The   Large Hadron Collider is switched onScientists threw the switch on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) - the biggest   and most complex experiment ever devised to lay bare the secrets of nature -   on September 10. After 14 years, £4.4 billion and the efforts of 10,000 researchers, the LHC    was launcheed to attempt to recreate the conditions that existed fractions   of a second after the Big Bang. During the day the first particles did circulate in the tunnel, as the machine   limbered up to smash beams of subatomic particles called hadrons in about 30   days. But less than two weeks later the experiment was shut down after a meltdown   caused by a faulty connection between two magnets. The fire brigade was called to the LHC after the fault, which sent the   temperature of crucial components soaring by 100degC (180degF) in a section   of the 17-mile underground circuit on the Swiss-French border. Helium also   leaked into the machine. Repairs are expected to cost £14million and take until Spring. Cancer   patient cured with own immune cellsA cancer patient has made a full recovery after being injected with billions   of his own immune cells in the first case of its kind, doctors disclosed in   June.The 52-year-old, who was suffering from advanced skin cancer, was said to be   free from tumours within eight weeks of undergoing the procedure. After two years he is still clear of the disease, which had spread to his   lymph nodes and to one of his lungs, it was claimed. Doctors took cells from the man's own defence system that were found to attack   the cancer cells best, cloned them and injected them back into his body, in   a process known as cell transfer immunotherapy or T-cell treatment. Experts   said the case could mark a major breakthrough in the treatment of cancer. It raises the possibility of a new way of fighting the disease, which claims   150,000 lives in Britain every year.

telegraph,9/1/2007 0:01,comment,"A scientific breakthrough in America may offer a solution to what has appeared to be an incorrigible moral dilemma. Stem cell research is acknowledged to offer the best (perhaps the only) hope of curing neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, whose irreversible effects have tragic consequences for millions of sufferers, and for the treatment of chronic debilitating conditions such as diabetes.          Until now, the most useful form of these cells – those with the potential to develop into a wide variety of different types of human organ – have been those obtained from living embryos specially grown for the purpose of harvesting stem cells. While there was a clear and urgent need for the medical progress that was promised by such programmes, it had to be balanced against an inevitable sense of moral revulsion. The notion of producing embryos – in effect, creating potential human lives – that were to be utilised for experimentation and then destroyed, was described by opponents as tantamount to cannibalism. So adamant were the ethical objections to this technique, particularly from religious lobbies, that stem cell research using live embryos was banned by Washington. (George W. Bush has declared his personal opposition to such research, but, in truth, it would be difficult for any American president to ignore the tide of popular opinion against it.)          Now a team at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina claims to have successfully extracted such 'pluripotent' stem cells from amniotic fluid – a natural product of pregnancy that is discarded in the normal course of events in childbirth. Their discovery is not a straightforward solution: collecting amniotic fluid is problematic and less reliable as a source of usable cells than purposefully grown embryos. But even the Vatican has said that it would withdraw its objections to research on stem cells if they were gathered in this way. Hopefully, this may be a step toward the humane resolution of what had seemed an intractable moral conflict."

The process would not be legal in many countries and would involve using DNA   extracted from fossils. George Church, a genetics professor of Harvard School of Medicine, said that   the process was possible and that far from being brutal and primitive,   Neanderthals were intelligent beings. They are believed to be one of the ancestors of modern man and became extinct   33,000 years ago. He added that altering the human genome could also provide   the answers to curing diseases such as cancer and HIV, and hold the key to   living to 120. He told Der Spiegel, the German magazine: “I have already managed to   attract enough DNA from fossil bones to reconstruct the DNA of the human   species largely extinct. Now I need an adventurous female human.”The professor claims that he could introduce parts of the Neanderthal genome   to human stem cells and clone them to create a foetus that could then be   implanted in a woman. Prof Church helped start the Human Genome Project that mapped human DNA and is   well respected in the field. His comments will surprise most geneticists who   believe that cloning humans is unacceptable. It is illegal in Britain. Prof Church said: “We can clone all kinds of mammals, so it’s very likely that   we could clone a human. Why shouldn’t we be able to do so?”He added: “Neanderthals might think differently than we do. We know that they   had a larger cranial size. They could even be more intelligent than us. “When the time comes to deal with an epidemic or getting off the planet or   whatever, it’s conceivable that their way of thinking could be beneficial.   They could maybe even create a new neo-Neanderthal culture and become a   political force. The main goal is to increase diversity. The one thing that   is bad for society is low diversity.”Prof Church said the technique would involve artificially creating DNA from   fossilised material and introducing this into human stem cell lines. He discusses his idea in his latest book, Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology   Will Reinvent Nature and Ourselves. He rules out recreating older human ancestors or dinosaurs, as was the subject   of the Jurassic Park films, because the age limit of useful DNA is about one   million years, he said. He told the magazine: “One of the things to do is to engineer our cells so   that they have a lower probability of cancer. “And then once we have a lower probability of cancer, you can crank up their   self-renewal properties, so that they have a lower probability of senescence   [ageing].”"
telegraph,2/1/2007 0:01,news,"A simple blood test that would predict a person's likelihood of developing different types of cancer could be in use within two years, scientists said yesterday.          Researchers have found evidence supporting the theory that mutations in stem cells, the body's basic building blocks that can change into other types of cell, are fundamental to the development of cancers.          Stem cells are kept in an immature state by proteins called the Polycomb group which suppress critical genes that would otherwise cause them to develop. When the body functions normally, it can transform stem cells into different types of cell by allowing different combinations of genes to be switched on.          However a process called DNA methylation, in which these key genes are permanently switched off, leaves stem cells unable to become healthy new tissue. Analysis of 200 different genes in adult stem cells, and of normal and cancerous breast, ovary, bowel and lung tissue has shown that DNA methylation predisposes cells to becoming cancerous.          As the process can be identified through a blood test, it should be possible to work out an individual's background risk of getting different cancers.          This would mean those at high risk could be screened more regularly — leading to many more cancers being treated at an early stage.          Dr Martin Widschwendter, of University College London's Institute for Women's Health, found that in cancerous samples the methylation process was 12 times more likely to have happened in the key genes than in others.          Dr Widschwendter, whose work was published online by the journal Nature Genetics, said: 'It is possible that in two years' time we could be introducing a whole new way of predicting cancer risk.'"

The world first involves mixing stem cells with chondrocytes – young cartilage   cells – and then injecting them into the joints to patch them up. Osteoarthritis affects an estimated eight million people in the UK, a million   of whom seek help from their doctor. The condition is caused by progressive wear-and-tear damage to the surface of   the joints, leading to stiffness and pain. In severe cases the joints have to be replaced with artificial implants. Each year around 60,000 hip replacements and about the same number of knee   replacements are carried out in the UK, almost all of them due to   osteoarthritis. The disease accounts for most of the estimated £5.7 billion a year economic   cost to Britain of muscular and skeletal conditions. The trial, funded by the charity Arthritis Research UK, will use stem cells   extracted from the patient and mix them with chondrocytes in a combination   therapy which could be available in less than five years. Up to 70 people with knee osteoarthritis will take part in the study, due to   be launched at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in   Oswestry, Shropshire, before the end of this year. The trial is part of a £500,000 five-year research programme. Stem cells are immature undeveloped cells that be turned into different kinds   of tissue and grown in the laboratory. In the trial, stem cells will be removed from the bone marrow using keyhole   surgery and grown in the laboratory for three weeks. They will then be implanted along with the chondrocytes into the area of   damage in the hope of forming new cartilage over a period of several months. It is hoped that the combination of cells will trigger a type of mending so   powerful that it could reduce the need for surgery and pain relieving drugs. Professor Sally Roberts and Professor James Richardson at Keele University,   are optimistic that the procedure could produce robust new cartilage cells   to treat patients with osteoarthritis. Professor Richardson said it was the combination that was exciting and that he   hoped that the “whole would be greater than the parts”. “We hope they work hand in hand or in harmony better than they do on their   own.”Professor Roberts said: “They certainly have huge potential - we just need to   learn how to harness it properly.'“We think this has great potential but the trial is experimental and we really   need to find if it works before we get too excited,” said Jane Tadman,   spokesman for Arthritis Research UK.

Walter Bast, 49, also regained the use of his right arm after the revolutionary treatment, which prevents brain cells from dying.If further trials of the treatment are successful, it could be on the market in as little as five years, providing fresh hope for the 45,000 Britons each year who suffer a haemorrhagic stroke, where a blood vessel in the brain bursts. Currently, the only option is surgery, which has a variable success rate. Half of surgery patients will die within a month and just one in 20 patients will recover to the extent of Mr Bast.The pioneering treatment, called CellBeads, involves cutting away part of the skull to tie off leaking blood vessels and remove blood from the brain.Surgeons then insert the 2cm by 2cm 'teabag' filled with capsules stuffed with around a million stem cells.The stem cells, taken from bone marrow, have been genetically engineered to make a drug known as CM1 that protects brain cells from dying. This lets the cells rejuvenate and repair the damage done by the stroke.After around two weeks, doctors at the International Neuroscience-Institute in Hanover, Germany, removed the 'teabag', resulting in Mr Bast regaining his speech and the use of his right arm.Speaking a week after the operation, the first of its kind in the world, Mr Bast, a mechanic, said: 'I feel a lucky guy.'The so-called CellBeads treatment is the brainchild of scientists at the British medical technology firm Biocompatibles International, based in Farnham, Surrey. The stem cells are encapsulated in beads to hide them from the immune system and ensure they are not rejected by the body. Enclosing everything in the 2cm square 'teabag' ensures the surgeon can easily remove it at the end of the treatment period. Mr Bast, who lives near Bremen in Germany, agreed to be the first to test the operation after suffering two strokes in quick succession. His surgeon, Professor Thomas Brinker, said: 'We see a recovery as good as this in only the minority of patients, so it is an encouraging start. It is important that we found no side-effects.' Dr Peter Stratford, of Biocompatibles, said a one-size-fits-all treatment could be stored in hospital freezers ready for use when required. If effective, it could have a huge impact on patients' quality of life and save the NHS billions. But stem cell scientists warned that many safety and ethical hurdles would have to be crossed before the treatment was accepted for widespread use. Haemorrhagic strokes account for around 30 per cent of the 150,000 strokes in the UK each year. Stroke is Britain's third biggest killer, after heart disease and cancer, and causes more disability than any other disease.  It costs the economy about £7 billion a year, including NHS bills and lost productivity.  "

Her father Yaser Martini, 43, a chartered surveyor of Roehampton, South West   London, said: 'We have embarked on this donor appeal knowing there was   only a slim chance of finding someone who is a perfect match for Margot, but   that's better than no chance.'“Margot needs to receive a stem cell donation from someone with a similar   tissue type as hers. “So we are on a worldwide search for a donor - and unfortunately, without much   luck to date.' A You Tube video campaign launched   on Christmas Eve has had more than 47,000 hits. It has also attracted the   attention of stars such as Stephen Fry and Gary Barlow. Donors and volunteers helping the search have begun to wear pink bracelets to   raise awareness of her plight. So far 20,000 people have requested a swab   kit. Delete Blood Cancer UK’s Deirdra Taylor said the response has been incredible. “We are so pleased with this response for Margot and her family and their   network of friends, who have all worked tirelessly for some weeks now in   raising awareness. In doing so they have actively mobilised so many people nationwide to express   their interest in getting registered as a potential lifesaver for Margot and   for the other patients just like her, also desperately needing a stem cell   donor. The greater the pool of donors, the more lives can be saved.'With more than 8,500 known characteristics that can occur in millions of   combinations, it is very rare to find two people with the same tissue type. “There is always great hope that we can find the perfect match, if enough   people come forward and register their details. They will be put onto a   database to be on standby to donate blood stem cells to support patients   just like Margot, who desperately need to find their perfect match. “The great thing is that if matched with someone, those donated stem cells   replenish in the donor within just a few days, so we’re really not asking   people to give too much.” Mr Martini said: 'It is like oxygen to us that there has been this   initial impact, but we are still seeking a perfect match.'The Martinis and Delete Blood Cancer UK are asking donors to come forward, by   organising a national 'donor drive', where volunteers register in   the hope that doctors can find the perfect match. Drives in London on February 1st and 2nd 2014, followed by another in   Wolverhampton have already been organised, with others being planned.   Details can be found at: www.deletebloodcancer.org.ukPotential donors who express an interest in registering can request simple DIY   swab kits which they can use at home to provide a cheek cell sample, or can   register at one of a number of events on one of three donor recruitment   days. Mr Martini said “For those who haven’t yet, I urge you to register to be on   standby to see if you could be a match to donate blood stem cells for Margot   or someone just like her. It only takes 5 minutes to register online at   www.deletebloodcancer.org.uk and they will send you a DIY swab kit.”Victoria Martini added: 'We feel like we need to do everything we can for   Margot.

Irina Bogomolova, who works in the chief prosecutor's office in the capital, Kiev, claims she was taken off the case because she came too close to the truth while investigating allegations made by women who claim their babies were taken away from them immediately after birth.          She said: 'I was sacked for political reasons. I demanded an investigation into all maternity wings in hospitals across Ukraine and I was relieved of duty after making that demand.          'A trade in stem cells exists here... I suspect there is a lot of bribery going on, right up to highest levels.          'Pregnant women, especially from rural areas, are very vulnerable targets as they will obviously believe whatever the doctors tell them. It's easy to take their babies from them and tell them they died or were born dead due to complications.'          The Council of Europe is to investigate allegations that newborn babies, and foetuses, have been killed to provide stem cells and internal organs for controversial medical and cosmetic treatments.          Officials of the Strasbourg-based human rights organisation are to travel to Ukraine in February to investigate the role played by some of the country's research centres and maternity hospitals in the international trade.          The council launched an inquiry in 2004 when several mothers accused hospitals of snatching their newborn babies to harvest their organs and tissue for the booming new industry of rejuvenation treatments, as well as treatments of illnesses such as Parkinson's disease and cancer. The treatments cost up to £12,000 in the Ukraine, but much more in western countries.          The inquiry was abandoned for lack of firm evidence, but is to be reopened after fresh allegations in the press. A BBC report on the subject, claiming that healthy babies may have been killed, is to be broadcast tonight on Radio 4.          Ruth-Gaby Vermot-Mangold, a Swiss MP who is a member of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly, and who previously investigated reports of missing babies, said: 'I have obtained reliable information, from mothers and other sources about five cases of newborns that went missing … I believe the mothers were telling the truth. I am more inclined to believe the babies were stolen for the purpose of adoption in the West.' Some 300 mothers who claim to have suffered the same fate are represented by the All-Ukrainian Federation of Families with Many Children. In 2003 its head, Tetyana Isayeva Zaharova, gave Council of Europe investigators a video which was said to show babies' bodies partly dismembered so that stem cells and organs could be removed.

telegraph,6/8/2010 7:30,news,"An 11-year-old British boy who came close to death after being born with a windpipe just one millimetre wide is now able to breathe normally again following pioneering surgery doctors have described as a 'kind of miracle'. Ciaran Finn-Lynch became the first child in the world to undergo the   breakthrough procedure to transplant his trachea with one grown from his own   stem cells. He had been born with a windpipe just one millimetre wide and went through   repeated surgery from a young age. Although he managed well with a series of metal devices to hold his trachea   open, they repeatedly burrowed into a major blood vessel causing 'massive   bleeding'. Speaking for the first time about her son's ordeal yesterday, Ciaran's mother   Colleen told how she thought she had lost him. But now, four months after   the operation, she said she had been 'given her boy back'. The technique involved taking a windpipe from a dead donor and stripping it of   its living tissue, before squirting the leftover scaffold with stem cells   taken from Ciaran's bone marrow. The trachea was then transplanted into his throat almost immediately where the   stem cells have grown into normal tissue to cover the scaffold and provide a   new windpipe. While the tissue was growing, his windpipe was supported by a   temporary scaffold which will dissolve naturally. The technique avoids complications associated with straight transplantation   when the body can often reject donor organs without powerful drugs to keep   the recipient's immune system in check. As the trachea transplanted in Ciaran is covered with tissue that has grown   from his own cells, his body will not reject it and he does not need any   anti-rejection drugs. A similar operation was carried out in Barcelona, Spain, two years earlier but   in that operation that stem cells were grown on the windpipe scaffold in the   laboratory and it was only transplanted four months later. Speaking yesterday as her family prepared to leave Great Ormond Street   Hospital in London for their home in Northern Ireland, Ciaran's mother said   they were not daunted by their son being the first child to undergo such a   procedure. She said: 'We didn't have much choice when it came to the operation.  'If Ciaran had one more bleed I don't think he would have made it.' She said they had '100 per cent faith' in the transplant team, led   by Great Ormond Street's Professor Martin Elliott.  'When they initially suggested the procedure we agreed to it, knowing it   would be the first time it had been tried in a child, as we have 100% faith   in them and the work they do. She said Ciaran's recovery had been 'up and down' but he kept his   spirits up.  'Because it's so new, nobody knows what's ahead, or how long his full   recovery is going to be, but we are on the right road now,' she said.  'We're just so grateful, we are delighted they gave Ciaran a chance,   we've got our boy back.' Ciaran, who turned 11 last month, is looking forward to going home and is   likely to return to school in September. A keen drummer, he is most excited about being able to play in his band again,   and even started practising with a lesson in the hospital's intensive care   unit recently. The donor was found for Ciaran four months before his operation, from a   30-year-old Italian woman. Colleen said: “We are obviously also incredibly grateful and indebted to   Ciaran’s donor and are aware of the heartbreak that family went through in   losing someone.  'They have displayed courage and selflessness and we would like to use   this opportunity to urge people to think about signing up to the organ donor   register.” It is hoped the technique will eventually replace almost all transplant   surgery. Prof Martin Elliott, director of the tracheal service at Great Ormond Street,   said 'enormous numbers' of patients could benefit from this technique in   future. In many types of surgery pieces of tissue from animals or plastic   substitutes are used but that could all be replaced with the patient's own   stem cells. "
telegraph,1/9/2011 6:40,news,"Artificial meat created in a lab could be ready to eat within six months, scientists claim – but the first burger will cost more than £200,000. Scientists have used animal cells to create an artificial form of meat without   the need for the rearing and slaughtering of livestock. The product, known as 'in vitro meat', is made from thousands of   stem cells which multiply to produce strips of muscle tissue without ever   leaving the lab. Dutch scientists experimenting with pig cells say it could be just six months   before the first test tube sausage is produced, and within a year lab-grown   burgers could be created using similar techniques with cows. The growing world population could soon mean that our farms cannot produce   enough meat to feed everyone, creating a market for artificial beef, pork,   lamb and chicken. Shifting the production of meat from farms to laboratories would also help cut   down the billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases released by livestock, while   requiring 99 per cent less land than beef farming. Prof Mark Post of Maastricht University, who is leading the research, said the   technique is far from ready for mass production and the cost of creating the   first burger could run higher than £220,000 (EUR250,000). But once the meat is ready for consumption, production lines could be set up   in plants producing large amounts much more quickly and cheaply. Currently the strips of tissue created in the lab, which are 2.5cm long and   less than a centimetre wide, appear grey and soggy but experts hope to make   their product as similar as possible to the real thing. The tissue, created by feeding a pig's stem cells with a serum taken from a   horse foetus, is attached to Velcro and stretched to mimic the way muscles   grow but still lacks the appearance of real meat. Prof Post told the New Scientist magazine: 'It's white because there's no   blood in it, and very little myoglobin, the iron-bearing protein. 'We are looking at ways to build up the myoglobin content to give it   colour. I'm hopeful that we can have a hamburger in a year.' There is no indication yet of how the meat tastes because strict regulations   prevent anyone from consuming tissue grown in a lab which has been fed on   animal products. Experts based at the University of Amsterdam hope to get around the problem by   creating a synthetic feed which provides the stem cells with everything they   need to grow. If scientists are successful in creating an edible product, the harmless   technique could even be applied to rare and endangered animals, paving the   way for products like panda burgers, experts said. The World Health Organisation has predicted that meat consumption will double   by 2050, and the increasing cost of animal feed is likely to rapidly inflate   the price of meat before then. In 2008 the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) organisation   offered a $1 million (£600,000) reward for the first scientist to produce a   marketable lab-grown meat before 2012. Despite the moral and ethical arguments surrounding stem cell research,   researchers believe it is inevitable we will have to resort to in vitro meat   in the near future. Prof Post said: 'I don’t see any way you could rely on old-fashioned   livestock in the coming decades. In vitro meat will be the only choice left.' Dr Helen Ferrier of the National Farmers' Union said: 'Clearly we would   prefer people to continue buying beef produced directly from the British   beef industry well into the future, rather than from cattle stem cells. 'There is great potential for traditional beef farming to be sustainable   and efficient, to reduce emissions and feed a growing population while   continuing to offer benefits to the environment, landscape and the rural   economy.' Emma Hockridge of the Soil Association added: “We mustn’t forget all the   benefits that grazing animals bring to the beauty and sustainability of our   countryside. It is unlikely that lab grown meat would ever replace meat   production in the UK and clear that there is still a long way to go before   these products are anywhere near being commercially viable.'"
telegraph,29/03/2002 00:01,news,"ATTEMPTS were made yesterday to defuse an international row over the access of scientists to arguably the most important genetic code on the planet - rice.The grain is the staple for more than half the world's population and the most important agricultural commodity in the developing world. The genetic code will allow new varieties to be developed within three years.The genetic sequence of rice is the first crop genome to be decoded and provides a crucial insight into the genetic codes of cereals such as maize, wheat and barley, which together provide 80 per cent of the world's consumption of food calories.Sir Paul Nurse, the British Nobel laureate, and Sir John Sulston, the human genome pioneer, were among 20 academics who protested against a plan that would put the entire genetic sequence of the japonica rice strain on a company database rather than having it published in the open.They complained to the editorial board of Science about the deal between the journal and a Swiss-based agrochemicals company, Syngenta.Science said yesterday that all researchers, whether academic or commercial, may access Syngenta's rice genome to 'verify, replicate or challenge findings published in Science' and that it would hold a copy of the data in escrow.'We have for the past year required others to deposit in Genbank,' said Dr Donald Kennedy, editor in chief of Science, referring to the international repository for genetic information. But an exception was justified in this case because Syngenta had made a commitment eventually to make a deposition and 'in view of the fact there is full public access'.'We would have preferred that everything be in Genbank,' he said.

dailymail,5/3/2015 14:35,sciencetech,"Biohacking has brought us the 'Frankenburger' and vegan cheese but the latest developments could lead to cultured designer fragrances. Experts in Boston are developing a perfume that smells exactly like roses but is made from genetically engineered strains of yeast.They hope to use the technology to create a range of  perfumes that even the most discerning customer won't be able to tell apart from the real thing.The plans were revealed to Aviva Rutkin at New Scientist by bioengineers from Gingko Bioworks.Rose oil used in perfume is typically harvested from large fields of the flowers planted across Europe. But because these crops can be affected by changes in weather or natural disasters the yield can vary wildly, which has led to perfumers searching for artificial alternatives. To make the cultured fragrance as close to the real thing as possible, the bioengineers at Gingko coded the genes of the rose to discover which enzymes are responsible for producing its smell. From these enzymes the experts can identify specific chemical compounds involved in the odour. They then modify the genome of yeast to engineer multiple strains of the fungus which each produce different metabolic reactions. The key is to engineer reactions between microbes that create the same compounds found in the scent of a rose.And the firm told Ms Rutkin that this can involve adding genes from a rose or other plant to the yeast's genome to force these reactions. The Boston-based firm is working with flavours and fragrance company Robertet and sends samples of each stage to the French firm for analysis and feedback.The goal is to create a designer fragrance that can be created in bulk and sold to consumers.Gingko is also working on other fragrances as well as cultured flavours and sweeteners. 'We're working on a number of cultured flowers where the scent of the wild flower is difficult or impossible to capture through traditional extraction - such as lily of the valley and hyacinth,' Jason Kelly from Gingko Bioworks told MailOnline. 'These flowers smell wonderful when growing on the plant but the extracted floral oil doesn't capture the scent. 'Perfumers would love to bring these novel scents to life in perfumes and using Ginkgo's technology to design cultured fragrances we hope to grant their wish.''The natural next step in the evolution of cultured foods is the advent of cultured ingredients,' added Gingko's Reshma Shetty. 'Aroma chemicals that previously were made via extraction from plants or synthetic chemistry can now be made via fermentation.'The mechanics of the process of making cultured ingredients is much the same as those used for thousands of years of cultured food production: the raw material (often sugar) is converted to the desired ingredient using microbes as processing aid.'In 2013 Dutch scientists grew ‘cultured beef’ in a lab using cells from a living cow. The world's first test-tube patty was dubbed Frankenburger, cost £250,000 and took three months to form.  Next, the cells are incubated in a nutrient ‘broth’ until they multiply many times over, creating a sticky tissue. This is then bulked up through the laboratory equivalent of exercise - it is anchored to Velcro and stretched.Finally, 20,000 strips of the meat are minced and mixed with salt, breadcrumbs, egg powder and natural red colourants to form an edible patty.The project was backed by billionaire Google founder Sergey Brin.Professor Post  spent seven years trying to turn stem cells into meat, and was first successful with mouse burgers.He then tried to grow pork - producing strips with the rubbery texture of squid or scallops - before settling on beef.More recently, biohackers in California discovered a way to create cheese protein genes based on sequences in cow DNA, before growing them in baker’s yeast and using them to create a ‘milk’ substitute.This milk can then be churned using traditional cheese-making methods to become real vegan cheese. Real vegan cheese is the brainchild of biohackers from Counter Culture Labs and BioCurious in California. To create the proteins, the researchers studied animal genomes to find natural milk-protein genetic sequences.They optimised the genes for use in yeast and created the resulting yeast milk protein DNA from scratch.This DNA is then put into yeast cells where the cells take over and produce real milk-protein.The genetically modified yeast creates cheese protein as it grows, and raw cheese protein is extracted and separated from the yeast.To make real vegan cheese, the researchers then take the cheese protein and combine it with the three other main cheese ingredients, including, fat, or in this case vegetable butter, vegan sugar in place of lactose, and water.Mixing these creates the vegan milk, which can then be then turned into cheese.Although the genes are inspired by the genetic sequencing of mammals, they are actually made from scratch. "
telegraph,23/05/2007 00:01,news,"Birds do it. Bees do it. Now it seems that sharks are the latest, and largest, creatures that are able to reproduce without having sex, a finding that could have important implications for conserving these endangered fish.         A female hammerhead shark has given birth without the help of a male, after genetic tests revealed that its baby shark had no paternal DNA.         An international team reports that the shark's 'virgin birth' was down to  an unusual method of reproduction known as 'parthenogenesis', where an egg starts to divide without being fertilised.         This is the first scientific report of male free asexual reproduction in sharks.         The study is reported in the journal Biology Letters by a team  from the Queen's University Belfast, the Guy Harvey Research Institute at Nova Southeastern University, Florida and the Henry Doorly Zoo, Nebraska.         Head of the Queen's team, Dr Paulo Prodöhl, said: 'The findings were really surprising because as far as anyone knew, all sharks reproduced only sexually by a male and female mating, requiring the embryo to get DNA from both parents for full development, just like in mammals.'             'The discovery that sharks can reproduce asexually by parthenogenesis now changes this paradigm, leaving mammals as the only major vertebrate (backboned creatures) group where this form of reproduction has not been seen.'              Given shark populations are in decline worldwide, and that parthenogenesis  probably occurs where female sharks have difficulty encountering suitable males, 'it raises concerns about the long term viability of some shark species (especially those under extensive fishing pressure)' said Dr Prodöhl.         'Incorporating this new information into our management and conservation efforts will be imperative to prevent further declines in genetic diversity for an intensely, and many instances over exploited, group of fishes.'            The gene tests were prompted by the unexpected birth of a baby hammerhead shark in an aquarium at the Henry Doorly Zoo in December 2001:  none of the three candidate mother hammerheads in the tank, all of whom been caught in Florida waters as babies, had encountered any male hammerheads in captivity.         By using DNA profiling to examine the genetic makeup of the baby hammerhead and the three candidate mothers, the researchers were able to identify which of the three was the actual mother.         There was no DNA of male origin in the baby shark, which eliminated the possibilities of earlier mating with a male hammerhead followed by sperm storage.         Parthenogenesis is only very occasionally seen in some vertebrate groups such as birds, reptiles and amphibians.         However, it has never before been seen in other major vertebrate lines such as mammals or sharks.         Co-author Dr Mahmood Shivji, said: 'Our findings suggest that parthenogenesis is the likely explanation behind the anecdotal but increasing observations of other species of female sharks reproducing successfully in captivity despite not having contact with males.         'Unfortunately, this occurrence is not benign because it results in reduced genetic diversity in the offspring since there is no new genetic variation introduced from the paternal side.'         The discovery raises concerns about the genetic and reproductive health of dwindling shark populations.          Coauthor Dr Demian Chapman said: 'Not only does it experience reduced genetic diversity because it has no father, but around half of the genetic variation present in the mother is not passed on to the offspring.         'Female sharks might reproduce like this more often when they have difficulty finding mates at low population densities. This could hasten the erosion of population genetic diversity and perpetuate the production of genetically disadvantaged offspring.'         From an evolutionary viewpoint (i.e. long term survival of populations and species), sexual reproduction is always better than asexual reproduction.         This is because sexual reproduction allows for increased genetic diversity which enables a population and ultimately the species to adapt/change/evolve to ever changing environmental pressures, from disease to climate change.         Scientists with the World Conservation Union, which publishes the Red Lists of Threatened Species, recently upgraded the 'threat' category of several sharks."

Aware of potential resistance from consumers, Simplot officials say Innate potato traits come exclusively from genes from domestic potato varieties.However, one of the company's oldest business partners — McDonald's — said it won't use the potatoes.'McDonald's USA does not source GMO potatoes nor do we have current plans to change our sourcing practice,' the company said in a statement Friday.Burger King and Wendy's declined to comment.Okanagan, based in British Columbia, wants to make apples a more convenient snack with its non-browning version. The company says bagged apples wouldn't have to be washed in antioxidants like they are now, a process that can affect taste. Company founder Neal Carter said Okanagan wants to see bagged apples become as prolific as bagged baby carrots.'We know that in a convenience-driven world, a whole apple is too big of a commitment,' Carter said.The apples are dubbed Arctic Apples, and Carter said he wants them to be labeled as such.

The company has about 400 acres of Innate potatoes in storage from the 2014 harvest that it plans to deliver to growers, packers and shippers to be sent to a tightly-controlled network for use in small-scale test markets.The company said those markets haven't been determined, and it's not clear how the potatoes will be labeled.

But the company also said it recognized the challenge of producing affordable food to meet demand and planned to monitor and possibly participate in research.'Regulatory compliance and consumer acceptance for the use of any new technology will guide our actions,' the company said.Simplot says its potatoes will have 70 percent less acrylamide, a chemical that can be created when potatoes are cooked at high temperatures. And it's touting that as a health benefit, as some studies have shown acrylamide to be a potential carcinogen, though the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health says scientists 'do not yet know with any certainty' whether the substance can be harmful in food.The FDA in its approval Friday noted that acrylamide has been found to be a carcinogenic in rodents.Simplot says its potatoes have 40 percent less bruising from impacts and pressure during harvest and storage then conventional potatoes, which the company said could reduce the more than 3 billion pounds of potatoes discarded yearly by consumers.The FDA's review process is voluntary, but both companies asked for one. To review, FDA compares safety and data of the GMO food in comparison to conventional variety.Gregory Jaffe, biotechnology director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in a statement Friday objected to the voluntary system for approving GMOs and said legislation is needed to make it mandatory.____Jalonick reported from Washington.

telegraph,1/10/2010 0:11,news,"Britain faces a brain drain of scientific talent because of proposed cuts to budgets, it has been disclosed.Scientists at some of the country's leading institutions say they are   preparing to move to better funded research positions abroad.Last week, leading vice-chancellors warned that Britain was in danger of   losing its position at the top of the medical research league if the   Government cuts budgets in the Comprehensive Spending Review.   An investigation by The Guardian has found that leading researchers,   including an Oxford professor of physics and a stem cell researcher seeking   a cure for the commonest form of blindness, are poised to go abroad. Professor Brian Foster, a particle physicist at Oxford, said he had been   offered a professorship at Hamburg University and was likely to move most of   his research to Germany.Dr Carlos Gias, a stem cell researcher at University College London, has   decided to move either to Singapore or the US. Dr Gias, whose research is   focused on a form of blindness called age-related macular degeneration, told   the paper that people in his department had been leaving for Singapore after   failing to find jobs in Britain. 'It's not been just one or two [but] several of them, and [in Singapore]   … they don't have any problems of funding,' he said.Last week, scientists said Britain's world-leading position in stem cell   research faced major problems if cuts were too deep. Sir Richard Sykes, the   chairman of the UK Stem Cell Foundation, said: 'The UK is without doubt   a leader in stem cell research. We need to translate and commercialise stem   cell therapies, or scientists will move away. 'I believe that the UK's position is under threat at the moment because   there is a funding gap which is currently filled elsewhere by private and   government funding.' At a Science Media Centre and Campaign for Science and Engineering meeting   last Friday, the heads of five universities and the Royal Society said   Britain would lose its position at the top of world research if the cuts   announced in the Comprehensive Spending Review later this month are too   great.Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, has said the Government will cut its £6   billion-a-year research budget and strip out 'mediocrity', with   only top-flight work attracting funding.

telegraph,4/12/2011 18:48,news,"British doctors are to conduct a trial using bone marrow stem cells that they hope could halt or perhaps even reverse the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS). The Bristol University team wants to recruit 80 people for the research, after   a pilot study in six people showed 'tantalising' results. The technique involves harvesting bone marrow from the patient, filtering out   the stem cells and then injecting them into the person's veins the same day. The theory is that the stem cells help repair damage caused to the protective   coating of nerve cells, called myelin, which is the cause of MS. Results from the safety study, published   last year in the journal Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics,   raised what researchers described as 'the possibility of benefit'. Professor Neil Scolding said at the time: 'We are encouraged by the   results of this early study. 'The safety data are reassuring and the suggestion of benefit tantalising.'However, the results showed no actual improvement in disease. Prof Scolding   said a larger study was needed. The experimental approach is also controversial because some clinics outside   Britain are charging thousands for it, before studies such as Prof   Scolding's prove its effectiveness. Last year the MS Society said one such clinic, the XCell-Center in Germany,   was 'marketing unproven treatments'. Now, following a £700,000 donation from an American charity, Bristol   University and Frenchay Hospital hope to begin the clinical trial in   February. About 100,000 people in Britain suffer from MS, in which nerve damage leads to   symptoms including sight problems and difficulty walking. Prof Scolding said: 'We are very excited by this as it will be the first   trial of any repair therapy in MS, not only in the UK but anywhere.' Sarah Mehta, from the MS Society, said of the research: “Stem cell therapies   have the potential to change the treatment landscape for people diagnosed   with MS and so it’s encouraging to see research groups in the UK exploring   this field. 'However, it is important to note that scientists are still some way off from   a safe and effective stem cell therapy for MS.”*Paper: Safety and feasibility of autologous bone marrow cellular therapy   in relapsing-progressive multiple sclerosis, CM Rice, EA Mallam, AL   Whone, P Walsh, DJ Brooks, N Kane, SR Butler, DI Marks and NJ Scolding,   Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics advance online publication, 5 May   2010 (DOI 10.1038/sj.clpt. 12-09-0672.R2).

Doctors were able to   take a sample of the children's stem cells, manipulate them in the   laboratory and reintroduce them. The children were given a working copy of the faulty gene and their condition   improved, enabling them to temporarily fight off infections.The treatment offers vital hope to the children who could be treated again if   they faced a serious infection. It is the third immune disorder that doctors   at Great Ormond Street Hospital have successfully tackled. The others were the life-threatening conditions, X-SCID and ada-SCID, and 14   out of 16 children treated have improved with some showing signs that their   immune system has been permanently restored. Remy Helbawi, 16, from South London, was the first children with x-CGD to be   treated. The condition only affects boys and means that while his body produces the   white blood cells to fight viruses it does not have the correct cells to   fight off bacterial or fungal infections. The resulting infections can be life-threatening. Up until now the only   treatment has been a bone marrow transplant which would offer a permanent   cure. Remy's brother who also had the disease was found a bone marrow match and was   successfully treated that way but no match has been found for Remy and a   serious lung infection was threatening his life. Remy said: 'Until I was ten I had the same life as anyone else, except I   had eczema a lot of the time. ' I didn’t have a fungal infection until about ten, but when I got my   first fungal infection my life changed. I missed a lot of school, I had lots   of tests and was in hospital. I would get exhausted after climbing stairs.'Before undergoing the gene therapy, Remy had to have chemotherapy which made   his hair fall out and he was kept in isolation for a month. He added: 'I was at home for a few weeks and then could return to school.   To start with, the stairs was difficult and my legs ached through lack of   exercise but in a few days started to feel better. “I never doubted in my mind it was going to work. 'Bone marrow transplant is a cure and at the moment the gene therapy has   an effect, I feel better, but we don’t yet think it is a cure.'Remy's nurse, Helen Braggins, said: 'Remy had been unwell for last two   years and began to miss school. He had significant fungal lung disease in   January of last year, which was getting worse. 'Without some radical treatment intervention Remy would not have survived   and was becoming increasingly short of breath. 'Remy desperately needed a bone marrow donor and even with the assistance   of Anthony Nolan undertaking a campaign so far we have not found one.   Therefore gene therapy was undertaken which has improved Remy’s health   immensely.'Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity is launching an appeal to   raise £66m to build and equip a new centre for research into rare diseases   like these. It is hoped the centre will investigate treatments for rare cancers as well as   conditions such as cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy. Around 3.5m   people in Britain are affected by diseases thought of as rare. Health Minister, Lord Howe said: “The UK already has a strong record of   supporting and treating people with rare diseases but we know we can improve   on this. 'I fully support Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity   fundraising campaign to help build a Centre for Children’s Rare Diseases   Research.

The  move means that researchers at the University of Newcastle will be the first in Britain to carry out therapeutic human cloning.          The scientists will use eggs left over from invitro-fertilisation treatment which would otherwise be destroyed.         They plan to duplicate the embryos and extract stem cells from them to use for  new treatments.          The embryos will be  destroyed before they are 14-days old and  will not be allowed to develop beyond a cluster of cells bigger than a  pinhead.         The permission was granted the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which licenses medical research on embryos and fertility treatment, after weeks of discussion.          Dr Miodrag Stojkovic, from the university's Institute of Human Genetics, said: 'We are all set up and ready to go immediately as soon as the paper work is sorted out.          'It has taken a year of work, and I am most pleased that the HFEA has recognised the potential of this technology in modern medicine.'          Cloning to create copies of human babies is outlawed in Britain, but therapeutic cloning has been legal since 2002.          In May the Stem Cell Group at the International Centre for Life in Newcastle applied for a licence to permit human cloning as part of its research programme.          Dr Stojkovic said he hoped that the research could lead to cures for genetic diseases, including diabetes.         'What we want to do is to see if these embryonic stem cells have the abilityy to differentiate into insulin-producing cells,' he said.         Prof Alison Murdoch, from the Newcastle Fertility Centre, said: 'We are absolutely thrilled. The potential this area of research offers is immensely exciting and we are keen to take the work we've done to the next level.'         However, she warned that it might take five years of laboratory work before clinical trials could be considered, although the Stem Cell Group is launching an appeal for more funding to speed up the research."
telegraph,11/4/2011 12:20,news,"British scientists have created human kidneys from stem cells in a breakthrough which could result in transplant patients growing their own organs. The artificial organs were created in a laboratory using human amniotic fluid   and animal foetal cells. They are currently half a centimetre in length - the same size as kidneys   found in an unborn baby. Scientists at Edinburgh University hope they will grow into full-size organs   when transplanted into a human. The breakthrough could lead to patients creating their own replacement organs   without the risk of rejection, a common complication in transplant   procedures. Physiologist Jamie Davies, a professor of experimental anatomy at Edinburgh   University, said: ''It sounds a bit science fiction-like but it's not. ''The idea is to start with human stem cells and end up with a functioning   organ. ''We have made pretty good progress with that. We can make something that has   the complexity of a normal, foetal kidney.'' The research team hope that doctors will eventually be able to collect   amniotic fluid, which surrounds the growing embryo in the womb, when a baby   is born. This will then be stored by scientists in case that person develops kidney   disease later in life. The fluid can then be used to create a matching   kidney. Creating an organ using a patient's own stem cells solves the problem of   having to use powerful immunosuppressant drugs to stop the body rejecting a   another person's kidney. Professor Davies said the technology could be ready for use on humans in   around 10 years. He added: ''Freezing a few cells is cost-effective compared with the cost of   keeping someone on dialysis for years. ''If you have got a bunch of stem cells sitting in a test tube, that is a long   way from being a beautifully, anatomically organised organ like a kidney,   which is quite a complicated structure. ''So we are working on how you turn cells floating about in liquid into   something as precisely arranged as a kidney.'' Around 7,000 people in the UK are on the waiting list for a new kidney and   demand for organs is increasing. The breakthrough will be officially unveiled at Edinburgh's Science Festival   this month. The use of stem-cell technology is seen as a 'holy grail', which   promises to reduce shortages of several types of organs. There are currently around 7,000 people on the waiting list for a kidney in   the UK. Last week, Japanese scientists grew a retina from stem cells for the first   time. "

But the amount of money available through public and private sources in Britain is dwarfed by the pool of cash available in the US.

telegraph,3/12/2007 0:01,news,"Broken skulls can be repaired using cells from human embryos, scientists have shown.         Researchers were able to plug holes in the skulls of mice by transplanting the stem cells, which grew into new bone tissue.         Although the study is at an early stage, the experiment indicated one way in which human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) might be used in practical treatments.         ESCs are immature mother cells found in pinhead-sized early embryos which are said to be 'pluripotent' - that is, they have the potential to develop into almost any part of the body, barring eggs and sperm.         Scientists believe the cells could prove invaluable for research and may also be used to treat a host of diseases.         Replacement tissue could, for instance, be grown to repair brains damaged by Parkinson's disease, patch up the pancreas to halt type-1 diabetes, or fix ailing hearts.         But destroying human embryos to extract stem cells is ethically unacceptable to many people.          Recently, scientists in the United States and Japan succeeded in transforming ordinary skin cells into cells with the same characteristics as ESCs. Ultimately it may be possible to use them for similar treatments.         The new research, at the Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, showed that it was possible using ESCs to repair 'critical-size' skull defects which would not normally heal on their own.         Scientists grew the stem cells in the laboratory, and from them derived mesenchymal precursor cells, a more developed cell type capable of giving rise to fat, cartilage, bone and muscle.         These were then 'seeded' into tiny three-dimensional 'scaffolds' and grafted into the mouse skulls.         The scaffolds were made of a biodegradable plastic-like material and a gritty mineral called hydroxyapatite.         It was hydroxyapatite that directed the cells towards becoming the 'intra-membraneous' bone tissue which makes up the skull, jaw and collar bone. When the mineral was absent, they transformed into cartilage.         Nathaniel Hwang, a PHD student who presented the research yesterday at the American Society for Cell Biology's annual meeting, in Washington DC, said: 'The promise of pluripotent embryonic stem cells for regenerative medicine hangs on the development of such control techniques.         'Left to themselves, human ESCs in culture differentiate wildly, forming a highly mixed population of cell types, which is of little use for cell-based therapy.'"

For Deborah Catlyn, it felt miraculous.          When her youngest child was conceived, Deborah was blind. Four months into her pregnancy, she had pioneering surgery that would eventually lead to her regaining her sight. The procedure was completed 18 months later - enabling Deborah to see for the first time the daughter she had named Miracle.          'The nurses told me I should keep the bandages on until the day after the operation, but I peeped through,' says Deborah, 35, a civil servant from Reading who has two sons, Javies, 17 and Beyonta, 11, as well as 19-month-old Miracle. 'I saw a nurse in a blue uniform, I saw a cupboard. I couldn't stop looking. When my children came to see me, I had a big grin on my face.          'The older ones had changed so much and grown so tall in the two and a half years since I lost my sight, but Miracle touched me most because I hadn't seen her at all. People used to stop me in the street when she was tiny and tell me how pretty she was. I couldn't understand what the fuss was about until I lined up the photos of her when I got home. Then I started to cry.'          Deborah, blinded when a woman threw acid in her face at a nightclub in 2002, is one of about 20 patients who have benefited from ground-breaking stem-cell transplantation surgery, performed by Sheraz Daya and his team at the Centre for Sight at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead in Sussex. Many, like Deborah, had undergone previous operations which had failed, and had been told they would never see again. One man had been blind for 15 years.          Mr Daya's technique involves taking stem cells from dead donors, living relatives or even the patients themselves. The cells are grown in the laboratory for two to three weeks until they form sheets, which are laid on the surface of the eye to help it heal. All the patients had lost vision because they had few or no limbal stem cells as a result of burns, chemical accidents or disease.          These cells, made just under the surface of the eye, are constantly regenerating: they keep the outermost epithelial layer of the eye clear so that it can act as an barrier against germs and dust. Without sufficient limbal cells, the cornea becomes overgrown, and vision becomes impaired.          'Before we transplant, we scrape off the material that has grown over the eye,' says Mr Daya, who this month presented the results of a clinical trial of his technique to an international conference of eye specialists in Washington. 'We lay the cultured stem cells on top and then cover them with a biologic dressing made from amniotic membrane which contains growth factors. The patient is given eye drops made from his own blood plasma, which also helps the cells to grow.'          Most patients' vision improves quickly but some - like Deborah - require a corneal transplant later. This will fail if it is done before the surface of the eye is fully restored, which is why Deborah had to wait 18 months for her second operation. Mr Daya estimates that the procedure might be suitable for up to 1,000 patients in the UK. 'The results are quite dramatic and, five years on, seven of the first 10 patients still have good vision,' he says. 'We have not seen survival rates like this before.'          Seeking an explanation for this success, Mr Daya's team made a remarkable discovery. Analysis of patients' limbal stem cells following surgery revealed no donor DNA. 'There are new stem cells there and they can only be coming from one place: the patient's own bone marrow. The donor cells we have put on the eye surface have somehow triggered the body into producing its own limbal cells.'          This finding means patients no longer need strong immunosuppressant drugs designed to stop the body rejecting donor cells. It may also have major implications for other organs. 'If we can figure out what the trigger signal is, we may be able to get heart muscle or even brain tissue to regenerate,' says Mr Daya.          Leading transplant surgeon Prof Nadey Hakim of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, has welcomed Mr Daya's findings. 'Should we succeed in generating entire new organs using the patient's own genetic material, this would overcome the likelihood of the patient rejecting the transplanted organ and cancel the need for immunosuppressive drugs,' he says. 'The work of Mr Daya has undoubtedly brought us closer to realising this dream.'          For Deborah, a dream has already come true. After eight operations - some of them excruciatingly painful - and two and a half years of blindness, she had despaired of regaining her sight. 'Sometimes, I would just sit and cry,' she recalls. 'I couldn't cook for my children, plait their hair, sort their socks. When one of my sons was sick, I could not see what was wrong or pour his medicine. Miracle swallowed a coin and I had no idea until she vomited it up.'          Bonding with her new baby took longer than usual. 'I was not interested in her when I was pregnant or until she had her first injections and I heard her scream. Now she goes everywhere with me. I call her my handbag - I never put her down.'          Deborah can now perform all the tasks she could do before her accident, including driving, but is considering having surgery on her left eye, which was damaged not only by the acid, but also by a childhood accident with a swing. She hopes to return to work shortly. 'I don't have to ask anybody to do anything for me now,' she says. 'I feel like a human being again.'

telegraph,1/6/2004 0:01,expat,"By Christine Doyle            Recent research into gene therapy has produced encouraging results, reports Christine Doyle                  Few professors of neurosurgery would be so confident as to describe the results of recent research as 'fabulous'. When, however, the professor is Tipu Aziz, consultant neurosurgeon at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, and regarded by the Parkinson's Disease Society as a 'key opinion leader', it is safe to assume that he is on to something.           The research that excites Aziz was carried out in France and relates to gene therapy. It involves genetically manipulating viruses to produce dopamine, the neurotransmitter that controls smooth movement and is deficient in the brains of Parkinson's sufferers.           Parkinson's is a progressive and devastating neurological disorder that can affect all activities, including talking, swallowing, walking and writing. It arises when defective cells in the part of the brain that controls movement die. Why this happens is unclear, but once 80 per cent of the cells have been destroyed, the symptoms emerge. About 120,000 people in Britain are affected, and 10,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.           'The manipulated viruses would act as a `repair' – rather than simply an alleviation of symptoms – in the hope that drugs would become unnecessary,' says Aziz. 'So far, the research with viruses has been carried out only on animals. Initial results in rats were encouraging, and work last year in monkeys is even more promising – fabulous. Basically, normal movement, activity and behaviour were restored. The technique appears to be safe and the monkeys have continued to produce dopamine.' The next step is to test the concept in humans, and Aziz is planning an initial trial.           'It could start within 18 months, once approval is given by the gene therapy advisory committee,' Aziz is due to tell those attending the second in this year's Science Today, Health Tomorrow lectures at the Royal Institution in London on June 16. These lectures, which enable members of the public to question experts about the latest research, are supported by The Daily Telegraph and sponsored by the healthcare company Novartis.            In fact, the Oxford trial would not be the first gene therapy trial for Parkinson's. A trial under way in New York involves switching off the hyperactivity of the subthalamic nucleus that drives the Parkinson's symptoms. However, Aziz has reservations. 'The technique turns a critical area of the brain from positive to negative. We do not know enough about the brain's neural interactions to know what that will do.'           At present, drugs that restore levels of dopamine in the brain are the mainstay of Parkinson's treatment. Although they are initially effective, they cause severe side effects in up to 70 per cent of patients. These include confusion and hallucinations.            While future drugs might minimise these problems, neurosurgery is increasingly used in the meantime. And thanks to molecular and technological advances over the past 10 years, it is ever more exact. Pallidotomy, for example, which involves burning out tissue in a part of the brain called the globus pallidus to reduce involuntary movement, is less likely to cause side effects than in the past.           Fifteen years ago, American researchers showed that the subthalamic nucleus, which had not previously been associated with Parkinson's, was over-active in sufferers. This led to the development of the deep brain stimulation technique. The surgeon implants electrodes in the subthalamic tissue and they are controlled by the patient using an external switch.           This technique, pioneered in France, has become a major and – at more than £30,000 – expensive form of treatment. About one in five patients might benefit, and it can reduce tremor, rigidity and slowness of movement.           'Another one in five patients have a related syndrome – a kind of `Parkinson's plus' condition –and are unable to move properly,' says Aziz. 'This syndrome is resistant to drugs, so the patients have no break from their excruciating symptoms. We are now working on stimulating the peduncular pontine nucleus, an area deep in the brain, but it could be four years before we can try it in patients.'           The targeted injection of chemicals – nerve growth factors – into affected brain tissue is another approach, being researched in Bristol.           Inevitably, some therapies have failed to live up to their promise. 'Foetal cell transplants did not lead to a dramatic improvement,' says Aziz. 'The logistics of collection after terminations were horrendous – and controversial.'           An equally controversial alternative is to transplant stem cells developed from embryos used for research and manipulated to produce dopamine. 'One drawback is that in animal studies some transplants get out of control and grow tumours deep in the brain. Although the technique offers real hope, we are more than five years from clinical use.'                     'I can be a mum again'                    When Ashley Harting was pregnant with her third child, her husband noticed, one night, that her left hand was shaking while she slept. She was 30 at the time, and the shaking continued after the birth of Francesca, who is now 13.          'I think most people noticed it well before I was aware of it,' says Harting. 'I was an educational welfare officer, which involved driving all over the county, and my driving started to get quite erratic. But my GP dismissed my concern. He said, incredibly, that it was my age: I had had three children, so what did I expect?           'Then, I had a serious car accident – nothing to do with my shaking – but my condition deteriorated afterwards. I felt frightened and insisted on being referred to a specialist.'          The specialist diagnosed writer's cramp. 'He suggested I was swinging the lead and wanted time off work. He even tutted while he was talking to me.' After a second consultant suggested that she might have multiple sclerosis or Huntingdon's disease, she and her husband split up.          'I felt under enormous stress. I was shaking, my speech was slurred, my movements were becoming impaired. Yet another doctor suggested it was all in my head – after a while, I began to think it must be true.'          Harting was 36 when she was finally diagnosed. Shortly after moving back to her home county of Lincolnshire, a GP, who became very supportive, told her she had been seriously misdiagnosed. 'Even then, the hospital chaplain asked me, patronisingly, if I was a young person with an old person's disease.'           In fact, Harting was among the five per cent of Parkinson's sufferers who are diagnosed under the age of 40. She was given a variety of pills and – as she was a young patient – was treated as a guinea pig, to some extent.           'At the time, I was on an average of 40 or 50 pills a day,' she says, 'and although these helped, my symptoms were hard to control. I was in and out of hospital, seeing a range of specialists. At times, I could scarcely walk, though I was determined to carry on as normally as possible for the sake of the children, who were now without a dad.          'Often, I could not cook properly for them or join in their activities. At one point, they had to help me to do everything, even washing and dressing. In the past, I had always talked fast – gabbled even – but now I was talking slowly and slurring my words and had become a quiet person, my friends tell me.'          The turning point came when Harting's GP felt she needed more help. She was put on a trial for deep brain stimulation at the National Hospital for Neurology in London. 'The stimulator is like a pacemaker and I turn it on from an external control on the left side of my chest, below the collarbone. It was not pleasant having it implanted – it took eight hours – but I knew it was working straight away. My movements became much smoother, the shaking eased and I began to walk and speak properly. After about six months, I felt completely stable. I am now off all medication.'          Harting, now 43, stresses she is not cured. 'I have problems with urinary incontinence, and try to avoid stress, which makes it worse,' she says. 'I don't know what will happen in the long term.'          Linda Kelly, chief executive of the Parkinson's Disease Society and chairman of the Science Today, Health Tomorrow lecture, is not surprised at Harting's delayed diagnosis. 'We still hear of doctors who suggest a patient's symptoms are due to alcohol,' she says. 'We stress the importance of having access to treatment as early as possible, at any age, to slow progression of the disease, prevent depression and enable the patient to live as normally as possible.'          Harting describes the effect of the brain stimulator as phenomenal. She now cooks, gardens with Francesca and can even drive her elder daughter, Lydia, to college.           'My children and my mother were so supportive, never grudging,' she says. 'Now, I feel like a normal mum again.'

dailymail,3/7/2015 0:01,wires,"By Kate KellandLONDON, July 3 (Reuters) - Scientists conducting a majortrial of a therapy that replaces the faulty gene responsible forcystic fibrosis say the treatment has showed significant benefitfor the first time in patients' lung function.The technique, developed with the technologycommercialisation firm Imperial Innovations, replacesthe defective gene behind the inherited lung disease by usinginhaled molecules of DNA to deliver a normal working copy of thegene to lung cells.'Patients who received the gene therapy showed asignificant, if modest, benefit in tests of lung functioncompared with the placebo group,' said Eric Alton, a professorat Imperial College London who led the trial.Briefing reporters about the results, he said they were'encouraging' but cautioned that because the effect wasinconsistent, with some patients responding better than others,the gene therapy was not ready for regular clinical use.'The effects were modest and variable,' he stressed.Cystic fibrosis is the world's most common lethal inheriteddisease, affecting more than 90,000 people globally. Patients'lungs become filled with thick sticky mucus and they arevulnerable to recurrent chest infections, which eventuallydestroy the lungs.In this trial, results of which were published on Friday inThe Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, 136 CF patients aged 12and over received monthly doses of either the gene therapy or aplacebo for one year.Patients who received therapy had significant, if modest,benefit in lung function compared with placebo, making the trialthe first in the world to show that repeated doses of genetherapy can have a meaningful effect on cystic fibrosis.Dominic Wells, a professor of translational medicine atBritain's Royal Veterinary College who was not involved in thetrial, said its findings laid 'a strong foundation for thedevelopment of more potent gene transfer systems'.In this trial, patients were treated by inhaling moleculesof DNA wrapped in fat globules, or liposomes, that deliver thegene into the cells in the lung lining.Alton said his team is now planning follow-up studies tolook at whether higher, more frequent doses might have a greaterbenefit, and to test ways of combining the gene therapy withdrug treatments to potentially boost its effect.The team has also developed another gene therapy deliverymethod using a hybrid virus created in the lab by combining aso-called lentivirus with another called Sendai virus, which isknown for its ability to efficiently deliver replacement genesto the intended target.

telegraph,3/10/2002 0:01,expat,"By Roger Highfield, Science Editor The first complete genetic analysis of the malaria parasite and the mosquito that transmits it to humans are published today. The work marks a turning point in the fight against one of humanity's greatest scourges.An international consortium of 150 researchers deciphered the genetic code of the parasite that infects half a billion people each year, killing three million.The sequence of 24 million genetic 'letters' is the recipe of Plasmodium falciparum, taken from a Dutch schoolgirl who contracted the disease almost 25 years ago.It is published today in the journal Nature after six years of effort by a team including the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, and the Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, Maryland, USA.In tomorrow's issue of the journal Science, another international team of more than 100 researchers led by Dr Robert Holt, of Celera, Rockville, publishes the sequence of 278 million letters that makes up the recipe of the Anopheles gambiae mosquito, which transmits the parasite as it drinks human blood.Along with the draft human genome, published last year, researchers now have a detailed insight into the DNA, or 'book of life', of the three components in the malaria life cycle.This will be crucial for developing new drugs, vaccines, repellents, insecticides and GM insects resistant to the disease.Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, said the 'potential major breakthrough' could help developing countries 'break free of the shackles of this devastating disease'.Malaria drugs and insecticides are failing because of resistance and there is no immediate prospect of a vaccine.However, Prof Brian Greenwood, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'The new information opens up new approaches to the development of drugs, vaccines, insecticides and insect repellents.'Prof Andrea Crisanti, who led a team that produced the first GM mosquito, said the announcements were akin to providing 'a route map to someone who is hopelessly lost. Now we can see where we are and where we can go.'But the battle against malaria is far from over. To exploit these genomes to control the disease will take money and commitment from drug companies and governments, said Prof Robert Sinden, of Imperial College London.Prof Fotis Kafatos, the director general of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory who helped analyse genes in the immune system of the mosquito, said the work was the 'end of a beginning'.But others are more sceptical. Prof Chris Curtis, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'I have a feeling that projects on the genome are done because molecular biologists think they can be done and are exciting to do. The justifications are added on afterwards.' Prof Curtis also pointed to the limitations facing 'governments with health budgets of $5 per head per year for all diseases'.Another expert was more blunt and told Nature: 'If more money were spent on developing existing vaccine candidates rather than hyping the genome, I think lives would be saved sooner.'Plasmodium falciparum is the first complex parasite for which scientists have a complete genome.Today's study reveals that it contains genes appropriated from plants millions of years ago, said Dr Neil Hall, who led a 50 strong team at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,.He said the parasite has an 'apicoplast', the remains of an ancient chloroplast, the light-gathering organ of plants, absorbed when 'the ancestor of all malaria parasites ate an alga'. Most of the enzymes identified in Plasmodium that have no counterparts in humans - and thus promise to be good targets for drugs - have been found in the apicoplast.Some thought that the £18.5 million parasite project would never be finished. 'Parts of the DNA are very unstable, which means some pieces just fell to bits when you tried to work with them,' said Dr Hall. He likened the effort to 'tearing up half a dozen Bibles, scattering the pieces over a playing field then trying to put them together again'.As for the work on the mosquito, Dr Holt said it would have immediate benefits in 'understanding the molecular basis of resistance to insecticides.'Dr Carlos Morel, director of the UNDP-World Bank-WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, said the work marked 'an extraordinary moment in the history of science'. He said: 'At last, the enormous power of modern technology is penetrating the mysteries of an ancient disease which continues to kill millions.'"
telegraph,8/4/2008 18:30,news,"Campaigners against the use of human embryos in research have challenged the licences that led to the creation of Britain's first animal-human hybrids.                                                      Hybrid embryos made by UK scientists                                                                        Hybrids: separating hope from the hype                                               A team in Newcastle University revealed a few days ago that it had created a cow-human hybrid embryo, so called cybrids.         Fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) ruled  that such research in Newcastle and also in London,    should be permitted to do fundamental scientific work as part of the quest to develop treatments based on stem cells for diseases such as Parkinson's and motor neuron disease.          The Authority acknowledged last night that it has now received the legal papers on the application for a judicial review submitted to the High Court.          'A petition has been made,' says Andrea Minichiello Williams of the Lawyers' Christian Fellowship, which made the application with the pro life group Comment on Reproductive Ethics. 'They have acted utra vires, outside the law.'          The challengers argue that the hybrids are not permitted under current law because, when current law was drafted, it was for human embryos, not hybrids. They will have to show that this interpretation was not the meaning intended by the Act, or that the HFEA acted irrationally in choosing this meaning in these circumstances.          The licences are justified on the basis of necessity and the pro life groups do not think this has been analysed in a robust way. 'Because of the thrust of science in other areas, it is not necessary or desirable to go down the line of creating animal human hybrids,' she says.          The news last week that Newcastle had made a cow-human cybrid, part of an effort to find ways to do stem cell work without the need for human eggs, came as the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill will be debated by the House of Commons.          This is the first legislation in this area for 18 years, intended to update the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 in the light of the scientific advances that have been made since then, and the pro life groups say argue that the HFEA has 'preempted the will of parliament.'          With respect to the Newcastle and King's teams, 'the HFEA were obliged to make a decision one way or another in relation to the licence applications: their own procedures oblige them to do so and if they had delayed pending the Parliamentary debates they would have been vulnerable to judicial review,' says Clifford Chance senior lawyer James Lawford-Davies.          He adds: 'If the HFEA's interpretation of the Act is found to be incorrect, and the court holds that it had no right to licence this research, the research may lawfully continue until Parliament introduces legislation to permit or prohibit such licensing.          A number of MPs and observers feel that it was wrong to allow this research to progress before the matter came before the Commons. This echoes the previous criticisms of the HFEA from the Science and Technology Committee in their 2002 report that 'Parliament does not need protecting and democracy is not served by unelected quangos taking decisions on behalf of Parliament'.          Dr Evan Harris, Liberal Democrat Science spokesman says: 'This legal challenge should fail because both the science and technology select committee, and the HFEA received clear legal advice that cybrid embryos were human embryos for the purpose of the 1990 Act, as all their chromosomal DNA is human, and that such research was permitted under the Act and the 2001 therapeutic cloning regulations'          'Critical to the unanimous decision of the select committee to recommmend that the HFEA issue the licenses was our view that the work was valuable for medical research, that it got round the problem of the shortage of human eggs, and if it wasn't licensable it would be legal and completely unregulated which certainly was never Parliament's intention.'"
dailymail,13/05/2015 06:01,wires,"CHICAGO, May 13 (Reuters) - Until recently, whole genomesequencing - technology that allows researchers to map all of anindividual's 20,500 genes - was prohibitively expensive, costingabout $20,000 just five years ago.As of last year, the cost had come down to around $1,500 pergenome. That has made it possible for drugmakers to use thetechnology on a massive scale to look for new drug targets.They are sequencing the DNA of very large patientpopulations to find rare genes that play a crucial role ineither causing disease, or protecting people from illness.Below is a sampling of these efforts:--Amgen in late 2012 bought Decode Genetics for$415 million in cash to gain access to a database of completegenetic sequences of 2,636 Icelanders. Researchers have usedthat data to model the genomes of another 100,000 Icelanders.In March, Amgen reported in Nature Genetics the discovery ofa new gene that raises a person's risk of Alzheimer's disease,and confirmed the role of two mutations involved in diabetes andatrial fibrillation.--In January 2014, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc signed a deal with Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania tosequence DNA from as many as 250,000 volunteers from Geisinger'spool of 3 million patients.--In January 2015, Roche Holding AG agreed to paymore than $1 billion for a majority stake in Foundation MedicineInc, a genomic analysis company that tests patients'tumors for mutations driving their cancers.That same month, Roche's Genentech unit inked a multi-yeardeal with Craig Venter's Human Longevity Inc to sequence andanalyze hundreds of thousands of genomes from patients in itsclinical trials, aiming to identify new drug targets.Genentech is also working with privately-held 23andMe togenerate whole genome sequencing data for about 3,000 peoplewith Parkinson's disease to identify new treatments for thedegenerative neurological condition.Garret Hampton, a Genentech vice president, said the companypreferred to collaborate with partners that already have geneticand detailed health information on patients, rather than buildits own database. 'It's hitting the ground running,' he said.--Pfizer Inc in January announced an expandedcollaboration with 23andMe giving the drugmaker access to itsdatabase of genes and medical histories to help Pfizer's studyof the autoimmune disease lupus.Last August, Pfizer partnered with 23andMe for data onthousands of patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease to betterunderstand why treatments help control symptoms for some, butnot others, said Jose-Carlos Gutierrez-Ramos, a group seniorvice president at Pfizer.--In March, 23andMe said it will build a drug discovery armusing its database of DNA and health information on roughly650,000 people. The effort will be led by Richard Scheller,Genentech's former head of drug discovery.--In January, Biogen Inc formed a $30 millionresearch alliance with the Institute for Genomic Medicine atColumbia University.Tim Harris, a senior vice president at Biogen who heads thecompany's newly formed precision medicine group, said thecompany is focusing on very targeted diseases such as multiplesclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or LouGehrig's disease.Through the partnership, scientists have sequencedprotein-making genes from around 3,000 patients with ALS and6,500 control subjects and discovered a new ALS gene. Thefindings were published in February in the journal Science.'What has changed fundamentally is not the philosophy thatwe need to understand more about disease by looking at genetics.What has changed is our ability to do it,' Harris said.

This was not the television presenter, but a Ferrari-driving biotechnology entrepreneur.Scientists have taken over from luvvies as New Labour's best friends. The likes of Noel Gallagher and Stella McCartney have been quietly dropped in favour of the men in white coats.It was no coincidence that Tony Blair singled out scientists for praise in his conference speech - a group was attending the '1000 Club' fund-raisers' day, culminating in lamb and lemon tart with Lord Sainsbury, science minister, in the Grand Hotel.Today, Prof Sir Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, a party supporter for 40 years, will speak at the conference - the first time such a person has addressed a political event. He said yesterday that he believed there had been a 'real turnaround' in the treatment of science under Labour.Ministers have angered environmentalists with their broad support for genetically modified food and they have infuriated the Roman Catholic Church by backing the use of therapeutic cloning - now known in 'spin-doctorese' as nuclear stem cell therapy.They are pressing ahead with the creation of huge genetic bases and envisage the introduction of genetic ID cards in the medium term. Plans are being drawn up to make it easier for scientists to get licences to carry out tests on animals for research purposes.The new round of science grants - including a big increase for the Medical Research Council - will be announced shortly. Mr Blair is instinctively in favour of science - it is about the future, not the past, modernity rather than tradition. He prefers Bunsen burners to Beefeaters. He sees science as one of the mechanisms for finding new solutions to old problems.The potential for genetics to transform health care, for example, fascinates him, and he seems incapable of making a speech without mentioning the need to get everyone on to the internet. Dotcom companies and biotechnology entrepreneurs are clearly going to be an increasingly important contributor to the economy over the next few years.In recent months, he has also become convinced that science is a way of boosting Britain's reputation in the world - when British scientists helped to decipher the human genome, a joint international press conference, via video link, was hastily convened between Mr Blair and President Clinton when the 'book of life' was read.In addition, strategists see science as another point of difference with the Tories, who have taken a more cautious approach on issues such as therapeutic cloning. Mr Blair thinks that science is something Britain is good at, but realises that the Government needs to do more to reassure the public about modern-day Frankensteins creating their monsters behind closed doors.The scientists are being wooed not only for their contribution to the country but also to encourage them to do more to get their message across. In his speech today, Sir Martin will call on scientists to understand the public more and on voters not to take fright so easily. He will condemn the 'tabloid' level of reporting of many discoveries and emphasise the importance of a realistic view of science.'Science isn't dogma,' he will say. 'Its assertions are sometimes tentative, sometimes compelling, but never certain; noisy controversy doesn't always connote evenly-balanced arguments; risks are never absolutely zero, even when hugely outweighed by potential benefits.' The sort of discussion of which Mr Blair wants more."
telegraph,21/02/2012 08:30,news,"Chris Stringer on how a series of extraordinary finds has transformed our view of human history – and of the cousins with whom we long shared the planet.Human beings have come to dominate our planet like no other creature before   us. Today, our seven-billion-strong population inhabits most of the surface   of the world, secure in its status as the only truly intelligent species on   Earth.Yet if we look even a little way back into the planet’s history, we come to a   time – possibly as recently as 50,000 years ago – when there may have been   as many as seven distinct types of human, from Africa to Europe to the wilds   of Siberia and the remote islands of Indonesia. We, Homo sapiens, are the   sole survivor of this menagerie – but for most of human history, we were not   alone.So where did these other “humans” come from? And what happened to them to   leave us as the only human denizens of the Earth? In recent years, a slew of   exciting discoveries in Africa, Europe and elsewhere has turned the received   wisdom on its head. We have learned that the story of our origins is far   more interesting – and complicated – than we ever thought.That story starts with a single species, the probable ancestor of this human   family. This was Homo erectus (“Erect Man”, because it walked upright),   characterised by a powerfully robust skeleton and a small-brained skull   which was thick-walled, long and low, with a glowering brow ridge over the   eyes and a chinless lower jaw. Despite these differences from the current   model, erectus was an effective tool-maker and hunter, with a body shape   more human than ape-like.Homo erectus emerged in Africa some two million years ago, and rapidly spread   across Asia and possibly southern Europe as well (Britain was probably only   occupied a million years on, by later human species). It is possible that   erectus hung on in Java until as recently as 50,000 years ago, making this   species by far the longest-lived of all the humans. And during that time, it   begat a whole tribe of descendants. These included Homo antecessor and   Heidelberg Man, with the latter giving rise to three recent successors: the   Neanderthals (who lived in Europe and the Near East), Homo sapiens (“Wise   Man”), and a mysterious third kind of human, the Denisovans, who are known   only from a single site in Siberia.Of our now-extinct cousins, the Neanderthals are by far the best-known. It was   believed that they were dim-witted brutes – and, as it happens, our direct   ancestors. It turns out that neither was the case. True, the Neanderthals’   societies were probably smaller and simpler than those of Homo sapiens, but   they buried their dead, were skilled tool-makers and hunters, and are   thought to have used language. Similarly, over the past few decades, they   have gone from being regarded as our direct ancestors to a side-branch that   we may have helped drive to extinction.What we have also now discovered – and this came as a real surprise to many scientists   – is that humans and Neanderthals actually interbred. Reconstructions of the   Neanderthal genome were recently made by a team led by Svante Pääbo, who is   based in Germany. The genome was compared with those of living people from   various regions. The comparisons suggest that the ancestors of people   outside of Africa must have mingled with the Neanderthals some 50,000 years   ago; as a consequence, the majority of modern humans are a tiny bit   Neanderthal. So, while they disappeared about 30,000 years ago, their DNA   did not.The Neanderthals occupied the western parts of Eurasia until modern humans   took over, but when the team which put together their genome turned its   attention to the east, it came up with another surprise. Fossils found in   the Denisova Cave in Siberia turned out to date from about 50,000 years ago.   One finger bone had exceptionally well-preserved DNA, allowing its genome to   be reconstructed and compared with those of Neanderthals and various modern   humans.This bone, it turned out, belonged to another group entirely, closer to   Neanderthals than modern humans: the Denisovans. Today, there is only one   group of people alive who show traces of their DNA – the aboriginal peoples   of Australasia, whose ancestors must have interbred with Denisovans living   in south-east Asia on their way south.In short, over the past few hundred thousand years (a mere sliver of time in   geological terms), there were perhaps half a dozen kinds of human all alive   at the same time, occasionally meeting and very occasionally having   cross-species sex.But there was another, much stranger, human-like species alive as recently as   a few thousand years ago – a tiny, mysterious creature whose discovery was   one of the most sensational of the last decade. East of the large island of   Java is scattered a remote, beautiful, tropical archipelago. Until 2004, it   was thought that only modern humans had reached these small Indonesian   islands. But in that year, two sensational papers were published in Nature   announcing that the remains of a new species had been excavated in Liang Bua   Cave on the island of Flores.This extraordinary little creature, named Homo floresiensis (aka the Hobbit),   was only about one metre tall and very small-brained. However, there is   evidence that the Hobbits were intelligent: Liang Bua Cave contained   evidence of tool-making, butchery of animal carcasses, and fire. What was   even more remarkable was the fact that Homo floresiensis survived there   until about 17,000 years ago.So who were these Hobbits, and where did they come from? At first, it was   assumed that they were castaways, descendants of Homo erectus who had   somehow got to Flores, perhaps by boat. Due to the limited resources   available on their new island home, the species then started to shrink (a   process known as island dwarfing).The latest studies of the Hobbit bones, however, have led to the radical idea   that these tiny people were in fact descended from something even more   primitive than Homo erectus – yet another species, whose ancestors emerged   from Africa two million years ago or more, and then evolved   in isolation in south-east Asia, finally disappearing only within the last   20 millennia.So given there were all these forms of “human” over the past million years,   what happened to the rest of them to leave us unchallenged? Well, we don’t   know when Homo erectus disappeared, unless the Hobbit is its direct   descendant. And we have no idea what happened to the Denisovans. But in the   case of the Neanderthals, their final demise seems to have been the result   of a double whammy: climate change, and the arrival of a competitor – us. We   most likely out-competed them for food and other resources, making better   tools and being helped through the bad times by our larger and more   organised societies.Whether the arrival of Homo sapiens in Flores was also the final straw that   finished off the Hobbit is still unknown; it is possible that a massive   volcanic eruption was responsible. But in a final twist to the story, it   seems that Africa could have been home to yet another species of human   within the last 50,000 years, based on signs of possible ancestral DNA in   modern African populations, and fossils found in Nigeria and Congo. Could   ancient humans, thought to have been extinct hundreds of thousands of years   earlier, have survived in central Africa far longer than anyone suspected?   There have been some extraordinary discoveries in the past decade, and we   can expect even more in the ones to come.

For example meat,   egg, milk, is from animals that have been fed from genetically modified   plants.”Telegraph   research has shown all supermarkets stock dairy and meat products from   animals fed GM, though none label the product.The   findings come just three weeks Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary,   suggested that food produced using GM is regularly fed to the UK public. “There isn’t a single piece of meat being served [in a typical London   restaurant] where a bullock hasn’t eaten some GM feed.”Peter Melchett, policy director at the Soil Association, said the new findings   prove that in fact the public want to know what is in their food. “This is a major blow to Owen Paterson’s GM policy. The FSA figures show a   large majority of consumers believe GM food labelling is important.”Under EU law, food containing GM ingredients, such as flour, oils and glucose   syrups, have to be labelled . However such as meat, milk and eggs from animals fed on GM animal feed do not   need to be labelled. Farmers admit that chickens and pigs are routinely fed GM soy, as it is   cheaper, and supermarkets are unable to guarantee that the products they   sell are not from animals fed GM unless they are organic. But the research, commissioned by the FSA, suggested that consumers want to   know when the animals are fed GM. 'Two-thirds of respondents10 considered it very or quite important that   it is written on a label if the food itself or ingredients in the food are   from a genetically modified plant or the food product is from animals that   have been fed genetically modified plants,' the survey concluded. In Germany, France and Austria government-backed voluntary labelling schemes   allow consumers to choose meat and dairy products fed GM-free feed. The FSA, that is in charge of labelling, is working with the EU over how to   label the use of GM in food products in the future. Dr Julian Little, Chairman of the Agricultural Biotechnology Council, said   most consumers will accept GM once they understand the science. 'Giving UK consumers greater confidence in the science and safety of   agricultural technologies will allow them to make an informed decision on   the future role for such innovations in the UK.”Do you think products from animals fed GM should be labelled?

telegraph,26/05/2010 15:00,news,"Cutting of babies' umbilical cords should be delayed to allow more vital stem cells and nutrients to flow from their mothers, researchers have claimed.By leaving more time between delivery to clamping and cutting the cord, more   blood is transferred to the child and more 'gifts' are handed over   in 'nature's first stem cell transplant', it was claimed. Researchers said that in western culture the umbilical cord may be clamped too   soon – usually between 30 seconds and a minute after birth. But this might prevent valuable umbilical blood being transferred to the   infant. It could also prevent anaemia – one of the most common blood disorders which   is caused by a lack of red blood cells. During childbirth, the placenta and umbilical cord start contracting and   pumping blood toward the newborn. Once the blood has reached an equilibrium, the cord's pulses cease and the   blood flow stops. By obstetricians and midwives delaying the clamping of the cord – or by   waiting until the pulses have definitely finished – newborns could benefit   fully from the blood transfer, said the team from the University of South   Florida. Dr Paul Sanberg, of the university's Centre of Excellence for Ageing and Brain   Repair, said: 'Several clinical studies have shown that delaying   clamping the umbilical cord not only allows more blood to be transferred but   helps prevent anaemia as well.  'Cord blood also contains many valuable stem cells, making this transfer   of stem cells a process that might be considered 'the original stem cell   transplant'.  'The virtue of the unique and immature features of cord blood, including   their ability to differentiate, are well known.' After reviewing the majority of research in the field, Dr Sanberg and his   colleagues concluded that delaying cord clamping could reduce the infant's   risk of many illnesses, including respiratory distress, chronic lung   disease, brain haemorrhages, anaemia, the inflammatory condition sepsis and   eye disease. His co author Dr Dong-Hyuk Park said that the formation of blood cells begins   in the embryo as early as two weeks into pregnancy. Delaying clamping the cord on birth could help reduce the risk of a number of   disorders, he argues. Dr Park said that 'delaying clamping the cord for at least 30 seconds   reduced incidences of intraventricular haemorrhage, late on-set sepsis,   anaemia, and decreased the need for blood transfusions'. Another potential benefit of delayed cord clamping is to ensure that the baby   can receive the complete retinue of clotting factors. In some cultures the cord is allowed to dry, wither and fall off naturally   which takes around three days. The study is published in the Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine. "

Regeneration of inner ear cells 'could prevent deafness'                                                                         'Gene hairs' could cure deafness                                                                        Britain's stem cell projects                                              The transfer of a specific gene is shown today by a milestone experiment to trigger the growth of new hair cells in the inner ear - the usually irreplaceable sensory cells that pick up sound vibrations and that are lost as a result of ageing, disease, certain drugs, and by excessive exposure to loud sound.          The approach, which one day could help millions of people worldwide with deafness and inner-ear disease, is made possible by a technique that is demonstrated in the journal Nature by an American team lead by Dr John Brigande of the Oregon Hearing Research Centre, Portland, who himself is profoundly hard of hearing.          Dr Mark Downs, Director of Science at The Royal National Institute for Deaf People, RNID says: 'This is an exciting development which completes another important piece of the jig-saw in understanding how we might use gene therapy to eventually restore hearing loss.'          However, he would not be drawn on when the first trials could start in patients.          'Together with the very positive early signs from other potential treatments, such as stem cell therapies, it is no longer just a pipe-dream to talk about cell and drug based solutions to restore hearing. There is a long way to go, but the journey towards new treatments is certainly under way.'          Named for the hair-like projections on their surfaces, hair cells form a ribbon of vibration sensors along the length of the cochlea, the organ of the inner ear that detects sound.         Receiving vibrations through the eardrum and bones of the middle ear, hair cells convert them to electrical signals carried to the brain.          People, like all mammals, are not able to regenerate hair cells when they are damaged or lost. Dr Brigande and colleagues show in Nature that by implanting a gene that regulates hair cell growth, Atoh1, into the mouse inner ear while the mouse is still in the womb, new hair cells are made.         Dr Anthony Ricci, a collaborator at Stanford University, showed that the newly formed hair cells function as well as normal hair cells.          As for human tests, Dr Brigande says that the work is at too early a stage to say when they can start: 'There is no present plan for tests in humans. The next step is to restore hearing in a deaf mouse.         'Only after this can we start experiments that will teach us if the approach might work in humans. So there is an enormous amount of work to do.         'The exciting news for those of us with hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears) is that we now have hope of having our hearing restored someday.'          He said that some deaf people will reject the offer of gene therapy. 'If a person is born without hearing, they are 'Deaf' and that is a unique culture into itself. Many Deaf individuals highly value their deafness and do not wish to be hearing.          'I was born hearing, and began to lose my hearing in grade school,' he adds. The cause is unknown.          'My hearing loss is progressive, so I need to think about other options in the very near future.'          Would he offer himself for the first experiments on patients? 'I have never considered self-experimentation to treat my hearing loss. I hope to contribute to an effort that helps define suitable therapies, which may one day be offered in the clinic. That's the right way to go about this.'          Normally, humans are born with about 12,000 hair cells in each ear and the death of the cells accounts for most types of acquired hearing loss.         Overall, the steady loss that accompanies the wear and tear of ageing produces significant hearing deterioration in about a third of the population by the age of 70."
telegraph,2/3/2014 7:00,news,"Dr Eileen Gentleman, Wellcome Trust Research Fellow at King’s College London, claims the field of tissue engineering is progressing at a remarkable pace with tailor-made tissues a real possibility in the near future'Back in the mid-1990’s researchers at the University of Massachusetts   apparently ‘grew’ a human ear out of the back of a mouse prompting protests   from groups opposed to genetic engineering. What many didn’t realise was that the freaky looking ear was never ‘grown’,   had nothing to do with genetic engineering and wasn’t really a scientific   breakthrough at all! Instead, it served as the public’s introduction to the   new field of tissue engineering, through which researchers attempt to create   replacement tissues in the laboratory by combining resorbable materials with   stem cells. Tissue engineers, like those in my laboratory at King’s College London, work   to build everything from cartilage to fix creaky arthritic knees to coronary   arteries to patch up heart patients. What looked like a human ear grown on a   mouse was simply what we call a ‘scaffold’, an implantable 3D structure made   of a plastic that safely dissolves in the body. Think of the resorbable sutures surgeons use, but moulded into an auricular   shape. Twenty years later, a UCL-based team led by Dr Patrizia Ferretti is continuing   to build on this work to reconstruct ears. Surgeons currently treat   microtia, a condition in which children are born with a malformed or missing   ear, by taking cartilage from the patient’s rib and implanting it in the   head to form something that looks like an ear. Dr Ferretti hopes to eliminate the need for this second cartilage-harvesting   surgery by growing ear cartilage in the laboratory. The difference here is that whereas in the 1990s tissue engineers thought that   merely forming a scaffold of the correct shape and size would allow us to   create a tissue, we now understand that a stem cell’s perception of its   nano-environment plays an important role in determining the tissue it   creates. In short, we can now tailor a scaffold with nano-cues that tell a stem cell to   become a liver cell instead of lung. Dr Ferretti’s scaffold does just this. Her team utilises a new ‘nanocaged’   POSS-PCU scaffold to coax stem cells collected from fat to form cartilage   whilst the scaffold slowly melts away. This exciting material came to light in 2011 when it was used to replace the   windpipe of a patient who had to have his own removed because of cancer. The scaffold here instructed stem cells to create the windpipe’s lining,   essentially using the body as an incubator to help direct their fate. This   time, the UCL team utilised a cocktail of chemicals to help push the stem   cells to make cartilage, so it remains to be seen if the scaffold will   similarly drive ear cartilage formation once placed in the body. What is clear, however, is that the field of tissue engineering is progressing   at a remarkable pace and tailor-made tissues to treat a range of conditions   are a real possibility in the near future.'

'However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine.' Rather, he should start each show with a disclaimer: 'The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University,' they said.The op-ed was penned by Dr Michael Rosenbaum, Dr Joan Bregstein, Dr Elizabeth Oelsner, Dr Sumit Mohan and Dr Dana March of Columbia University Medical Center, Dr Michelle Odlum of the School of Nursing, Dr Katherine Shear of the College of Physicians & Surgeons, and Tal Gross of the Department of Health Policy and Management.On Friday, Dr Oz, 54, said he was 'very proud to have that feedback' from his colleagues as he appeared on the Today show.'The [Dr Oz] show has to be much broader than what might take place in a doctor's office,' he said.'I completely respect why so many of my colleagues might have a difficulty with that, but I'm also appreciative that many of them do understand why that's important.' While appearing on Today, he insisted that, despite the criticisms, his show will continue. He has been hosting the program since 2009.'Without question, the show will survive it,' he said. 'I want to keep doing the show for as long as I can because I think we played an important role in making America a better place.' Even though he often wears his scrubs on air, he added that his show is not about medicine, but about living 'the good life', such as looking at the power of prayer or techniques abroad.He said he continues to stand by his use of the word 'miracle' to some treatments - but wishes he had not used it for weight-loss supplements.'This is a flawed area with lots of fraud, both in the research and in products,' he said. 'And we no longer talk about them. I haven't talked about them in a year.'And talking about the letter from the 10 doctors last week, he said that those critics have agendas, particularly against genetically modified organisms, which he has supported.'The 10 doctors who attacked me got what they wanted – sensational headlines and sound bites,' he previously said on his Thursday show, which was entitled The Truth About His Critics. 'It's ironic that I am being accused of a conflict of interest by these doctors, when, as you are about to see, some of them have their own conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also.'Four who signed the letter, including leader author Henry Miller, have at some point been associated with the American Council on Science and Health. The organization has previously received grants from Monsanto, who manufactures GMO seeds. During his show on Thursday, Oz denied attacking genetically modified foods.'That is not true. I have never judged GMO foods,' he said. 'But just like 64 countries around the world, I support GMO labeling so you can decide on the foods for your family.' Dr Miller had written of Oz: 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. I think I know the motivation at Columbia. 'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country.'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.' Columbia previously released a statement that it 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.' "

British research, with no   such restrictions, consequently benefited. President Obama revoked the order   in 2009.Professor Peng Khaw, director of the biomedical research centre at Moorfields,   said: 'It is crucial that we continue to attract external investment for   world-leading research in the UK.'"

The directive will come into force automatically within 18 months, giving the EU the world's toughest rules on GMO.There was confusion in Strasbourg over whether the new law would result in the lifting of an EU moratorium on GMO products. For the past three years a group of five anti-GMO countries - France, Italy, Denmark, Luxembourg and Greece - have used their blocking powers to prevent the European Commission approving any new products.Fourteen are waiting for licences. These include a tomato used in puree which was sold for a time by Sainsbury's, a Swedish potato with enhanced starch, and resistant strains of cotton and maize. The environmental group Greenpeace said the law was a major step forward."
telegraph,14/02/2008 19:02,news,"Evidence that it should be possible to take skin cells and safely turn them into embryonic like cells to treat a vast range of diseases is published today.           The work takes doctors one step closer to the day that doctors will not need to clone embryos in order to create an unlimited supply of any of a patient's own cells and tissues for novel treatments and transplants, whether to treat diabetes or Parkinson's disease.           Researchers recently showed that adult human and mouse skin cells could be 'reprogrammed' to be capable of generating any type of cell in a manner similar to embryonic stem cells, sidestepping many ethical objections to this work.           Now the pioneer of this method, Prof Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University, reports today in the journal Science that his team has moved another step closer to understanding how these 'induced pluripotent stem cells' or iPS cells might be reprogrammed without causing tumours when they are transplanted into the body, a crucial step if they are used to study disease or developed for human therapies.           Dr Takashi Aoi and his other colleagues reprogrammed adult mouse liver and stomach lining cells into iPS cells by genetically altering the cell by introducing three new genes with a kind of virus, called a retrovirus.           There have been concerns that the retrovirus could trigger cancer, by introducing the new genes in such a way to cause problems to useful stretches of DNA, for instance genes that suppress tumour growth.           The team was able to confirm in iPS cells made from adult cells that the virus did not insert genes this way. Mice implanted with the rejuvenated cells remained tumour-free six months after receiving the new cells.           But he tells the Telegraph that practical uses of the reprogrammed cells are still years away.           'In order to apply this technology to clinics, we still have to study the safety of iPS cells in bigger animals such as monkeys,' he says. 'It will take years to do this.'           'It is very encouraging that the method does not lead to preferential insertion of the retroviruses into tumour suppressor genes,' comments Dr Robin Lovell-Badge of the National Institute for Medical Research, London.         'However, even if rare, this may happen occasionally, so some caution is still needed. The insertions could also effect genes required for the iPS cells to form the specific cell types that might be required for cell-based therapies.           'So it would still be better if the reprogramming method could avoid the use of these viruses. This is one reason why it is still desirable to pursue other methods of reprogramming, such as so-called 'therapeutic cloning'. Once we understand how reprogramming works we can devise the ideal way to achieve it safely.'           Prof Yamanka's work is a remarkable advance that prompted Sir Ian Wilmut, who led the team that cloned Dolly the sheep, to tell The Daily Telegraph that he would adopt the new method rather than the nuclear transfer method that his team used to create Dolly.           The Japanese work has now been confirmed in other laboratories. A few days ago, UCLA stem cell scientists led by Kathrin Plath and William Lowry used genetic alteration to turn back the clock on human skin cells and create cells that are nearly identical to human embryonic stem cells, iPS cells.         'Our reprogrammed human skin cells were virtually indistinguishable from human embryonic stem cells,' says Dr Plath. 'We are very excited about the potential implications.'"

From tomorrow, British business executives, sports stars, celebrities and anyone else with £38,400 to spare will be able to freeze a backup of their adult selves for potential use decades later.Claiming to be a world first, the service has been developed by Scéil, part of   Cellectis, a French genome technology company on the Euronext stock market.Launched in Switzerland, Dubai, Singapore and the US two months ago, it   involves taking cells from a small sample of the skin under local   anaesthetic at a dermatologist, shipping them to Scéil’s laboratories and   “rebooting” them into induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells, otherwise simply   known as stem cells.These are frozen at -180C and stored to potentially repair damaged organs,   rebuild tissue and fight disease in the future. The service is based on   Nobel Prize-winning medical research by Prof Shinya Yamanaka in Kyoto, Japan.“Shinya Yamanaka broke a paradigm of science,” says Cellectis chief executive   André Choulika. “He discovered that you can take any cell of the body, put a   cocktail of things inside and it then forgets the state it is in and comes   back to the first stage of life, nine months before birth.“These cells have the potentiality to give any kind of tissue of your   organism. You freeze time at the second a sample is taken and the cells   won’t age after this moment.”Scéil’s service differs from cord blood banking, in which blood is taken from   the umbilical cord for later use to reconstitute blood. “We believe it’s   going to be very popular with a certain class of people who have everything   they want but cannot go against ageing,” said Mr Choulika. “This is   expensive, so only reserved for a certain class of people who can afford it. “Twenty years ago only rich people had cell phones. Now everybody has them.”Cellectis specialises in genome engineering and stem cell treatment. Since its   foundation in 1999, Dr Choulika says the company has developed new classes   of products in biopharmaceutical production, agrobiotechnology, induced stem   cells and alternative fuels. The group is due to launch a trial later this   year with University College London on potential genetic therapies for   chronic leukaemia.Last year, Cellectis had revenues of £27 million from deals allowing medical   institutions and pharmaceutical companies to use its technobiology and   research.“Scéil offers people the best possible chance in the future,” said Dr   Choulika. “People should be able to 'live young’ no matter how old they grow.“We’re offering the potential for people to use their cells for their cure as   soon as regenerative medicine treatments become available.”Scéil says that IPS cells can be derived from adult cells at any time of life.   However, due to human cell DNA degeneration over time, Scéil recommends that   interested people should give their skin samples sooner rather than later.Dr Choulika said Britain had been chosen for launch because medical   regulations allow it to function. In France, in contrast, he said the   service would not be permissible under current legislation."
telegraph,10/6/2014 16:00,news,"Genetically modified mosquitoes could help stamp out malaria by preventing biting females from being produced Mosquitoes have been genetically modified so they only give birth to males in   a new technique that scientists hope could help to wipe out malaria. The disease is spread by female mosquitoes, which pass on the disease when   they bite humans. But researchers from Imperial College London have now tested a new method that   introduces genetically modified mosquitoes to normal Anopheles gambiae mosquito   populations, the main carrier of the malaria parasite. The GM insects had been altered so that they would not produce female   offspring. In the first laboratory tests where the modified mosquitoes were mixed with   normal insects, 95% of the eggs laid hatched into males. It is hoped that if this could be replicated in the wild, the technique would   ultimately cause the malaria-carrying mosquito population to die out within   a few generations. Dr Nikolai Windbichler, a lead researcher from the Department of Life Sciences   at Imperial College London, said: 'What is most promising about our   results is that they are self-sustaining. 'Once modified mosquitoes are introduced, males will start to produce   mainly sons, and their sons will do the same, so essentially the mosquitoes   carry out the work for us.' Although scientists have bred infertile mosquitos before, this is the first   time they have been able to manipulate the sex ratios of mosquito   populations. It is only the female mosquito that bites as it feeds on blood to get the   protein it needs for their eggs. The scientists introduced the genetically modified mosquitoes to five caged   wild-type mosquito populations. In four of the five cages, this eliminated   the entire population within six generations, because of the lack of   females. Malaria is one of Africa's deadliest diseases, killing on average one child   every 60 seconds. Globally, there are more than 200 million cases per year   and more than 650,000 deaths, mostly in African children under five. Since 2000, increased prevention and control measures have reduced global   malaria mortality rates by 42 per cent, but the disease remains a prevalent   killer as mosquitoes become increasingly resistant to insecticides and   malaria parasites resistant to drugs. Dr Roberto Galizi from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College   London, said: 'The research is still in its early days, but I am really   hopeful that this new approach could ultimately lead to a cheap and   effective way to eliminate malaria from entire regions. Our goal is to   enable people to live freely without the threat of this deadly disease.” During the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, scientists   inserted a DNA cutting enzyme called I-PpoI into Anopheles gambiae   mosquitoes. In normal reproduction, half of the sperm bear the X chromosome and will   produce female offspring, and the other half bear the Y chromosome and   produce male offspring. The enzyme used by the researchers works by cutting the DNA of the X   chromosome during production of sperm, so that almost no functioning sperm   carry the female X chromosome. As a result the offspring of the genetically modified mosquitoes was almost   exclusively male. "
telegraph,15/10/2007 22:00,news,"Genetically modified poplar trees and grasses could help solve soil pollution, new research suggests.          Two research groups in Britain and America have independently developed GM - 'transgenic' - plants that remove volatile toxins and residues of military explosives from the environment.          Tests by the American team on laboratory-grown engineered poplar plants showed they could remove and detoxify 91 per cent of one of the most common groundwater contaminants.          Unaltered plants were only able to clear away 3 per cent of the trichloroethylene pollutant.          The six-inch tall cuttings broke the chemical down into harmless by-products 100 times faster than ordinary plants.          Trichloroethylene is a widely used industrial degreaser that makes its way into groundwater because of improper disposal.          Other pollutants were also taken up extra-rapidly by the transgenic poplars. They included chloroform, a by-product of disinfecting drinking water, the solvent carbon tetrachloride, and vinyl chloride, which is used to make plastics.          The US scientists believe GM poplar trees have great potential as pollution-busters, but first restrictions on growing transgenic trees will have to be relaxed. In both the US and UK, they can currently only be grown for research purposes.          There are concerns about the possible effect GM trees might have on ecologies and the environment.          Study leader Dr Sharon Doty, from the University of Washington in Seattle, said: 'As researchers we want to make sure such concerns are addressed and risks minimised. In the case of contaminated sites, we're already facing bad situations where the use of transgenic plants may reduce the known risks from carcinogens and other hazardous pollutants in the environment.          'Our ultimate goal is to provide a more rapid way to reduce the amount of carcinogens, one that is affordable so many sites can be treated.'          She pointed out that poplars are fast growing and can grow for several years without flowering.          To prevent the GM trees spreading, they could be harvested before releasing their seeds. Dr Doty added that branches of the hybrid poplar used in the experiments will not take root when they fall to the ground, as is the case with some other trees.          Poplars use an enzyme, a biological catalysts, called cytochrome P450 to break down contaminants. Ordinary plants already have a gene that makes the enzyme. But the scientists inserted a rabbit version into the plants which works faster. Ultimately the researchers hope to manipulate the plant's own genes to achieve the same goal.          In a second paper, also in the same journal, a team at the University of York has engineered plants using genes from micro-organisms encoding enzymes that break down toxic and carcinogenic explosives.         A research team, led by Prof Neil Bruce, has identified a unique bacterial enzyme system that degrades RDX, the most widely used explosive, previously thought to be resistant to biological degradation.         Decades of military activity on training ranges have resulted in pollution of both land and groundwater with explosives. The use of live ammunition has already been restricted by the US Environmental Protection Agency at a military training area in Massachusetts because of the threat of RDX in the water supplies of nearby communities.          With funding from the US Department of Defence, the team has been researching ways of using plants to degrade these explosives on US military sites.         Plants expressing these bacterial genes become highly efficient remediation 'machines', able to degrade efficiently the RDX present in soil and water.          Prof Bruce said: 'We have characterised a novel enzyme system that, when deployed in plants, rapidly breaks down RDX, representing a significant advance on our previous work.         'In collaboration with colleagues at the University of Washington, one of our Worldwide Universities Network partners, we are now developing a low-cost, sustainable technology using native grass species to clean up military training ranges and industrial sites.         'These low-maintenance remediation methods could potentially be applied to other pollutants such as chlorinated solvents.'"

Environmental groups rounded on Minister Phil Woolas for resurrecting the possibility of allowing GM produce in the UK.         Environment Minister Mr Woolas said there was 'a growing question of whether GM crops can help the developing world out of the current food price crisis'.          Mr Woolas has held talks with the Agricultural Biotechnology Council, an umbrella group formed in 2000 to promote the role of biotechnology in agriculture.

Tricia O'Rourke, a spokeswoman for Oxfam, said: 'The present food crisis needs more than a technology fix.          'Science and technology have a vital role to play but more focus is needed on sustainable farming technology that the 400 million smallholder farmers can use to improve their productivity.'          Greenpeace agricultural campaigner Jan van Aken said there was no science behind the biotechnology industry's claims that genetically modified crops could ease the crisis.          'I am appalled that the GM industry is abusing the misery of millions of hungry people around the world, using it as propaganda to sell a product by claiming it would reduce hunger.'          Friends of the Earth said the Government had been seriously misled if it thought GM crops were going to stop the food crisis, as they did not increase yield or tackle hunger or poverty.         Friends of the Earth's GM Campaigner, Clare Oxborrow, said: 'In the UK, the public have rejected GM food and extensive trials have showed that GM crops are more damaging for farmland wildlife than their conventional equivalents.'          The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was possible GM crops could offer 'a range of benefits' over the longer term, and there was no scientific evidence suggesting GM food is unsafe.          'However trials are still continuing and the Government's position has always been that we will not agree to the release of a GM product if there is any significant doubt about its impact,' a Defra spokesman said.          The Government has already decided that there is no scientific case for a blanket ban on GM crops, but following heated public debate about so-called 'Frankenstein foods' it made clear in 2004 that commercial planting would go ahead only on a case-by-case basis if it can be shown to be safe for humans and the environment."
telegraph,23/06/2008 12:20,news,"Gordon Brown was urged not to rush 'headlong' into embracing genetically modified crops amid claims there is little evidence they will solve food shortages or cut rising costs.  Sir Martin Doughty, chairman of Natural England, the Government's countryside and wildlife agency, said that the Prime Minister should not consider GM foods a 'quick fix' for a 'huge challenge'. He also warned that the crops could prove harmful to Britain's wildlife. The intervention comes just days after ministers signalled that they were considering allowing more trials of GM foods in Britain. The European Union has launched a study into whether increased use of the crops could help to curb soaring food costs across the world.  The cost of some basic foodstuffs have soared over the last 12 months. The price of wheat has doubled over the last year and rice and coffee prices at one of their highest point in a decade. But Sir Martin said there was little evidence that the current generation of biotechnology crops will help to solve food shortages or preserve wildlife. In a letter he wrote: 'The evidence of field-based trials on GM crops previously proposed for commercial release in England demonstrates that they can have a detrimental indirect impact on farmland biodiversity.' Because they have been genetically modified, many GM crops have to be used in conjunction with extremely strong weedkillers. Official tests four years ago showed that weedkillers used with GM beet and oilseed rape were much more damaging to wildlife than conventional herbicides. Earlier this month ministers signalled that they could support more genetically modified crops being grown in Britain. But Phil Woolas, the environment minister, stressed that the 'very robust' procedures for ensuring the safety of experiments would continue. The Government insists that any future big decisions on GM crops should be decided entirely on the scientific evidence. But environmentalists have accused GM advocates of using high food prices to try to force governments into approving the crops. Friends of the Earth claims that attempts to portray GM crops as a solution to food shortages is 'cynical'.On Wednesday, Natural England is due to put a policy document, Biotechnology in the Natural Environment, before its board for approval which says: 'Because GM can be used to develop organisms with radically different properties, we are particularly concerned about potential impacts on biodiversity that could be caused by changes in crop, tree, or animal husbandry.'

dailymail,5/7/2015 0:03,news,"Grabbing the ball and setting off down the pitch at full sprint, Connor Hughes was desperate to help his university rugby team score a much-needed try.It was the start of the second half, with everything to play for in a pre-season friendly. As the teenager dodged between the other team's players and charged towards the goal-line on a dry, autumn day, life felt good.Then suddenly, a tackle from behind brought him to the ground with a sickening crack. In an instant, his world was changed completely.For as he collapsed onto the grass, he suffered terrible damage to his spine that would leave him paralysed from the shoulders down, only able to move his eyes and mouth.It was a devastating injury that could easily have left such a fit and energetic young man bitter and defeated. Yet against all the odds, the student, now 20, has refused to be trapped inside a useless and shattered body.In an inspirational interview with The Scottish Mail on Sunday he has vowed – with the backing of a family whose boundless determination is nothing short of breath-taking – to do everything possible to fight back.Already, ten months on from the rugby match that changed his life, he has undergone intensive therapy at a specialist clinic in the United States to regain some control over his shoulders and his arms.And next month, he will fly out to Thailand to become one of the first British spinal injury patients to take part in a ground-breaking stem cell treatment programme.Even being able to perform the simplest tasks most of us take for granted – such as picking up a cup or a comb – would count as a massive triumph.Yet Connor is aiming even higher, daring to hope that, even if it takes years, he may one day defy his injuries and walk again.In the kitchen of the family home, near Kelso, Roxburghshire, Connor, says: 'Every day I wake up wishing it hadn't happened and it's the last thing I think of at night before I go to sleep.'This time last year I was about to go on holiday to Cyprus with my girlfriend. Now I'm in a wheelchair. But I never think 'poor me'. It's happened and I can't do anything about it. But I can change what's to come.'He will travel to Bangkok in a few weeks to receive stem cell injections, one of a number of willing spinal injury patients from all over the world who have been encouraged by early results at the Better Being Hospital.The hope is the cells will create new pathways in his spinal cord, which still remains intact despite the rugby injury, but is 'blocked' by fibrous scar tissue and nerve damage.Part of his treatment during his 45 days there will also include surgery to implant a tiny device – an epidural stimulator – which emits electronic pulses and encourages the stem cells to develop, as well as helping his chronic pain.He added: 'My ultimate goal is to walk again but for me life is about baby steps at the moment. When you've been fit and healthy and are now in a wheelchair, it can be hard to see the positives. But if I am able to start using my fingers again, that will be another huge victory.'After leaving Merchiston Castle school, in Edinburgh, where he was the youngest pupil ever to play for the 1st XV, he started a sports science course at Stirling University in 2013, later switching to accountancy and business.On September 13 last year, Connor was playing outside centre against Harris Academy FP, in Dundee, when tragedy struck. In the thick of the action, he started running with the ball, only to be brought down.As more players piled on top, he felt himself being rolled over and pressure on his neck. At first, he thought his neck and shoulder were badly injured, but when the mass of bodies cleared, he found himself unable to get up and knew instantly something terrible had happened because he could no longer feel his arms and legs.He said: 'It was one of those freak accidents. There was a lot of confusion. I remember having the ball and everyone piling on top. I felt pressure on my neck. There was no pain but that was the point everything changed. When I tried to move, I realised I couldn't. It was pretty scary.'His shocked flatmate, who was also playing in the match, called Connor's family to say the teenager was on his way to the city's Ninewells Hospital for treatment.But no one was prepared for the enormity of the news that would follow. His C5-C6 vertebrae – two of the seven cervical vertebrae in the neck – and his spinal cord were damaged, leaving him with no sensation from his shoulders down.Under police escort, the student was transferred 80 miles by ambulance to the spinal unit in Glasgow's Southern General for surgery. His devastated mother, Fiona, 48, and older sisters Sarah, 28, Stephanie, 25, and Rachael, 23, were uncertain if he would live or die.'It was horrific,' says Mrs Hughes. 'Every one of his sisters said they'd wished it was them instead of him because of his age.'Told he was unlikely to ever walk again, they spent every day with Connor in the unit, where he remained for the next three months. Among a long list of negatives, one positive shone out – his fitness and strong lungs meant there was no need for him to be on a ventilator.And as his family refused to accept his fate and researched the medical options open to him, a huge community fundraising effort got under way, with donations from well-wishers and organisations, such as the Scottish Rugby Union. With the aid of a new laptop and a voice activation feature, he also got back to studying for his university course.Connor said: 'It didn't take me long to accept that although things were bad, they still could have been much worse. If my break had happened two vertebrae higher, I wouldn't have been able to do much.'It's devastating news being told you will never walk again but really the doctors are only trying not to give you false hope. But I've discovered there's no such thing as false hope, just false promises, and you should never give up. You never know what's around the corner in terms of a breakthrough.' Within weeks, tens of thousands of pounds had been raised to help him and he was able to start on the first step of his recovery by flying 6,000 miles to a specialist rehabilitation centre in California. At Project Walk, in San Diego, the focus is on trying to work around a patient's paralysis, keeping muscles and nerves alive through exercise and diet rather than allowing them to stop functioning.With spinal cord injuries, scar tissue and severed nerves in the spine prevent messages getting through from the brain to the rest of the body but experts believe they all still work below a certain level.If they remain strong, there is a hope that one day the paralysed person will be able to walk again.Since his return four months ago, with his sister, Rachael, who travelled with him to learn the Project Walk techniques, he has kept up a daily routine of exercise with the help of his siblings.He said: 'I've learned not to expect to be walking in a few months. It's about having a big goal in sight and little goals in between.'Connor admits he has been overwhelmed and humbled by the fund-raising effort on his behalf. He said: 'I can never thank everyone enough. It kept me focused when I could so easily have given up. It kept my hopes of walking again one day alive.'Currently a £30,000 extension – paid for by the funds raised – is being built at the family home to house a gym for Connor.'Without the financial support we've had – and continue to have – it would be petrifying,' he said. 'My heart goes out to anyone on their own who doesn't have the help from family and friends that I have.'I know one man in his 50s who was in the spinal unit with me. He's still in his local hospital because they can't find him a suitable house adaptable for his needs.'There were people ahead of me in terms of treatment earlier this year and now, because of my opportunities, I'm way ahead of them.'By way of demonstration, he carefully stretches his arms out and raises them slightly – something which would have been unthinkable even six months ago.His sister Sarah, who has given up her job as a vet to help care for Connor, believes stem cell therapy is the next step forward.She said: 'He's got more mobility in his shoulders and arms because we've been moving and exercising him all the time. But the nerve pains in his hands are sharp. We're hoping stem cell therapy will help that.'He also has no ability to control his body temperature and feels cold most days and could be prone to hypothermia if not watched closely.Despite his injuries, Connor remains passionate about youngsters continuing to play rugby.He said: 'I loved rugby 100 per cent and I would never tell anyone not to play it. It has a great safety record but accidents will happen as they do in anything. I was just very unlucky but rugby gave me fitness, taught me to be a team player, gave me the right mental attitude, I think, to get through this.'He added: 'It also speaks for itself that I was the only injured rugby player in the spinal unit. Everyone else was there because they'd been in a car crash or had had a fall.'He is still so keen on the game that his mother reveals with a rueful smile that he hopes to get involved in wheelchair rugby.'It used to be called murder ball, it's so rough,' she says, wincing slightly. 'But his attitude is 'What's the worst that can happen? I've already broken my spine.'On Connor's website Stand Tall, inspirational words by American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson are emblazoned across the top. They read: 'Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.'Mrs Hughes added: 'It's hard for us as a family to feel sorry for ourselves when we're faced with that attitude from Connor. I'm just blown away by his bravery.'We're so lucky that Connor is still Connor. We're just fighting now to get his body back.''I never think 'poor me'. It's happened but I can change what's to come''It's about having a big goal in sight and little goals in between'."
telegraph,12/3/2001 0:00,news,"GREENPEACE has renewed its opposition to field trials of 'golden rice', a GM crop being developed to combat blindness and malnutrition in the Third World.Greenpeace International said last month that it would not attack trials planned in the Far East following claims that 50,000 people would go blind for each month that the rice, enriched with vitamin A, was delayed.Greenpeace, whose representatives will visit the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines next week, has now said it will treat the rice like any other GM organism.Benedikt Haerlin, Greenpeace international co-ordinator, based in Berlin said: 'Although we do not have any immediate plans to take direct action against 'golden rice' field trials, we reserve the right to take direct, non-violent actions against any releases of GMOs into the environment.'The fundamental environmental safety issues remain unresolved for golden rice just as for any other genetically modified organisms,' he said, adding that he was not convinced that the rice would be effective.Attacks on trials 'are something I would neither confirm nor deny', added Von Hernandez, campaigns director of Greenpeace South-East Asia. 'Greenpeace is against any open releases of GMOs into the environment. This applies to golden rice as well and, as always, we reserve the right to take direct, non-violent action on any threats to the environment.'Activists including Lord Melchett, a former Greenpeace chief, have sabotaged GM crop trials because they fear that the crops could lead to 'genetic pollution'.The rice institute is concerned at such acts, but there has not been similar action in the Philippines. Only one set of trials of a GM corn have been held in the Philippines to date and, while there were protests, the trials themselves were not damaged.Vitamin A deficiency affects up to 800 million children, or 14 per cent of the world population. Prof Ingo Potrykus, of ETH, Zurich, developed GM rice, with provitamin A, to counter this."

This research could alleviate the current dependence of heart failure patients on heart donors'.Dr Lior Gepstein, who led the Israeli research team, said the heart cells, called cardiomyocytes, could be used inside an adult heart to replace dead or dying tissue.The team used chemical growth factors to convert the raw stem cells into cardiomyocytes. As the cells divided, they formed microscopic clumps called embryoid bodies. In about 10 per cent of these, the researchers found groups of 20,000 to 30,000 cells spontaneously contracting - like the cells that develop into heart tissue in an embryo. Further tests confirmed that they were heart cells. The researchers are now experimenting with different combinations of growth factors in an attempt to induce the stem cells to produce 'pure' cultures consisting only of cardiomyocytes.Falling donor numbers have extended the waiting time for a heart transplant operation in Britain to about three months.Prof Sir Charles George, medical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: 'An important milestone has been reached. It gives real hope that people with heart disease may benefit from stem cell technology.'    A separate team at Technion has shown that embryonic stem cells can produce insulin, signalling an important step towards a possible cure for type one diabetes, in which sufferers are dependent on insulin injections.The research, reported in the journal Diabetes, said it should be possible to grow insulin-producing cells in the laboratory.

telegraph,5/8/2013 19:00,news,"Householders could be growing steaks in their own kitchens within the next twenty years, according the scientist who produced the world’s first test-tube beefburger. The burger, which cost £220,000 to make before being cooked and eaten for the   first time at an event in London yesterday, was created from 20,000 tiny   strips of muscle that were grown from a handful of cells taken from the   shoulder of a cow. Professor Mark Post, a tissue engineer at Maastricht University who has led   the work, revealed that he now plans to adapt the technology used to create   the burger to grown entire cuts of meat. He claimed the approach could even be used to allow people to try meat from   unusual or rare animals such as penguins without any needing to be killed. Professor Post said it would be possible to take a few stem cells from an   animal’s muscle and grow them into pieces of meat that were ready to eat. He said: “Potentially you can do this in your kitchen – you could grow your   own meat.  'You have to know eight weeks in advance what you want to eat, but you   could do that. “It is my ambition to produce thicker pieces of meat like a steak. “We will need a channel system to get the nutrients to the centre of the meat   as it grows. This has been done with medical tissue so we can adopt those   technologies. “Can we make penguin burgers? I guess we can as all birds have the stem cells   we need in their muscles. “Potentially you can do this with any stem cell from a muscle. Fish, birds and   mammals all have them. It could be used with fish, chicken and lamb.” It has taken the team behind the laboratory grown burger, which they are   calling “cultured beef”, nearly six years to develop the technology needed   to create meat that could be eaten. The research has been funded by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, whose identity   as the donor had been a closely guarded secret until yesterday. Professor Post believes the technology may eventually provide an alternative   to livestock farming that has less of an impact on the environment and does   not require the slaughter of animals. He adapted technology that is being used by other researchers who are   attempting to use stem cells to repair the human body. Instead he found that by taking stem cells from the shoulder muscle of a cow,   he could grow them in Petri dish full of nutrients so they would eventually   form muscle fibres. The muscle fibres were grown in doughnut shaped rings that contracted and   relaxed in the same way as they would in a real animal, helping them grow in   bulk to the size of a rice grain. Chef Richard McGeown cooks the lab-grown burger (Reuters)Around 20,000 of these strips were used to make a single five ounce burger –   containing around 40 billion muscle cells. Professor Post insisted that the resulting meat should be identical to muscle   found in a real cow, but lacked the fat and some of the iron rich blood that   gives meat its colour. He said that they hoped to be able to grow fat cells in a similar way and were   aiming to do this in the next couple of months. They are also to conduct tests to see if they can improve the meat to make it   more nutritious. He added: “It took us a long time to get this far and I think it is important   to show everybody that we can produce meat in this way. This burger took   three months, which is faster than a cow. “I am confident we can scale this up and the price will reduce to a point   where it will appear in supermarkets. It will take us 10 to 20 years to get   it into the supermarket. “Current meat production is at its maximum and is not going to supply   sufficient meat for the growing demand in the next 40 years, so we need to   come up with an alternative. “This is an ethical and an environmentally friendly way to produce meat.'(PA)For the tasting, the scientists had to use beetroot juice and saffron to give   the off-white lab-grown meat some realistic colour. Due to cost and time it took to produce a single burger, only two people were   able to taste the it at the event in London yesterday. Hanni Rutzler, a German food scientist, and Josh Schonwald, an American food   writer from Chicago, were served the single burger with a bun, piece of   lettuce and tomato on the side after it had been cooked by Richard McGeown,   the chef at the Great House Restaurant in Poperro, Cornwall. The two volunteers struggled to describe the meat, instead describing its   texture. Mr Schonwald said: “It lacks flavour. It has a middling flavour like pasta or   an animal protein cake. It wasn’t unpleasant.” He added that he would have preferred to eat it with some ketchup.While lab grown meat is seen as a way of overcoming many of the ethical   objections vegetarians have against meat, the reaction to the project has   been mixed.Lynne Elliot, chief executive at the Vegetarian Society, said: 'The biggest   question for many vegetarians is why?  'Why go to this much trouble and expense to replace a foodstuff that we simply   do not need?  Wouldn't it be simpler, cheaper and more sustainable to just   stop eating meat altogether?'For others, lab-grown meat provides a way of helping to supply food in the   face of a growing global population.Dr Sandra Stringer, a senior microbiologist at Institute of Food Research,   said: “This is a very interesting way we may be able to tackle the problem   of providing enough protein for an increasing world population. 'People around the world are eating more and more meat and on a global   scale we can’t sustain this. 'This certainly would be a less land, energy and water intensive way of   satisfying growing demand for meat.”  "
dailymail,7/4/2015 0:52,health,"How's that New Year's resolution to get super-fit going? If you've already shoved your expensive trainers - along with your marathon-running aspirations - to the back of a cupboard, don't feel too guilty.Although a study out today has found that occasionally getting out of breath is good for you, a host of other research suggests you can have too much of a good thing. For it seems you're better off taking a brisk walk that leaves you out of puff, or a gentle jog around the block, than training for a marathon.Studies have shown that extreme regimens can expose committed fitness-seekers to memory problems, tooth loss, failing sex drive and fertility, muscle wastage, poor immunity to infection and even a lifetime of heart trouble. They are also prone to injury.Steve Berkman, a physiotherapist from London, reports a big rise in the number of women undertaking challenges such as the London Marathon and triathlons.'Only this morning I have had three female first-time marathon runners in the clinic,' he says. 'They may have the cardiovascular fitness to run 15 to 20 miles at the weekend, but in the rush to get fit they haven't given their muscles and tendons time to adapt, so they got injured.'The contrast between gentle and rigorous regimens was highlighted this year by Danish investigators who tracked more than 5,000 people over a 12-year period.They found that light joggers - who ran no more than three times a week and for no more than two and a half hours in total - had the lowest rates of death in the group, compared both with those who did no exercise at all and with the most extreme exercisers.A nine-year Oxford University study of more than a million middle-aged British women, published in February in the journal Circulation, found that those who did gentle exercise such as walking, gardening or cycling, four times a week were 20 per cent less likely to suffer from heart problems, stroke and blood clots than inactive women.However, the researchers also found that women who did daily strenuous activity were at increased risk of heart disease and stroke.One explanation for this seesaw between benefit and risk is that moderate exercise can increase the length of people's telomeres. These are protective caps of DNA and proteins that sit at the end of our chromosomes, helping them remain stable.As telomeres shorten, they start to fall apart, causing our cells to age and die more quickly. Shorter telomeres are associated with an increased risk of premature death and with age-related diseases, including many cancers.In 2013, a study published in the Lancet found that moderate exercise produced a healthy stimulus that helped to promote the growth of telomeres when combined with a healthy diet.The Danish study, however, suggests extremely strenuous exercise has the opposite effect, causing telomeres to shorten.Lead researcher Dr Peter Schnohr, a cardiologist with the Copenhagen City Heart Study, says: 'If your goal is to improve life expectancy, jogging a few times a week at a moderate pace is a good strategy. Anything more may be harmful.'This contrast in benefit and risk between light and strenuous exercise has also been highlighted by recent studies on the brain.In November, Japanese scientists reported how two weeks of low-intensity exercise such as brisk walking boosts activity in the hippocampus, a brain region important for forming new memories.However, intense exercise appears to provide no such benefits, say the biochemists in the International Journal of Sports Medicine.A separate Chinese study shows that exercising to the point of exhaustion may cause chemical imbalances that kill brain cells in the hippocampus and reduce surviving cells' ability to communicate with each other.Too much exercise seems to cause an overload of the brain chemical glutamate, which may cause clinical problems with memory and thinking in athletes.Tooth loss may also be a concern. A 2013 investigation in the British Journal of Sports Medicine examining 278 athletes during the 2012 Olympics found that most had high levels of tooth decay, tooth loss and gum disease.And in September, a team of German dentists claimed to have discovered why. Lead researcher Dr Cornelia Frese says our saliva changes when we exercise hard. People who run fast for more than 35 minutes see their spit become much dryer and then more alkaline, she says.Saliva 'has a very protective function' for teeth, so reducing it threatens dental health. Furthermore, alkaline saliva allows tooth-rotting plaques of bacteria to grow on the enamel, Dr Frese reports in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports.And, as research shows, tooth-decay bacteria are associated with an increased risk of heart attack and dementia, although the reason for this is unclear.Strenuous exercise regimens can also interfere with a woman's monthly cycle. Exercise-induced amenorrhea (the absence of menstruation) is a common, reversible condition that afflicts up to a quarter of female athletes. Frequent intense exercise stresses women's bodies in such a way as to interrupt the normal release of a chemical called gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which prompts the release of eggs. This can mean periods stopping or becoming less regular.Men's sex drive can also diminish due to heavy exercise.Australian researchers, meanwhile, have added another drawback - increased susceptibility to infections. The Queensland University investigators found that strain on the body from intense exercise can cause a drop in the blood levels of infection-fighting T-cells.But the most worrying threat, as numerous studies have shown, is heart damage.Like any other muscle, the heart can enlarge with regular exercise. Vigorous sustained exercise can particularly affect the right ventricle (the lower right-hand chamber), according to a study last year in the journal Pulmonary Circulation.The researchers explained that an enlarged right ventricle can alter the heart's electrical system, causing abnormalities in rhythm that can result in lifelong problems with chest pain, breathlessness or fainting.These heart problems can even be fatal - one recreational runner in 15,000 suffers sudden cardiac death each year.Given these risks, one has to ask if extreme exercise is worth it.Anthony D'Silva, a cardiovascular science clinical research fellow at St George's, University of London, wrote a review of sudden cardiac death in the journal The Physician and Sports Medicine. He says: 'Evidence suggests that beyond an optimal level of fitness, the principle of diminishing returns applies. Exercise appears to most benefit people who are least active.'Dr Miranda Armstrong, who conducted the new Oxford University study, found that women who prefer to exercise vigorously can enjoy the same benefits as those who exercise gently four times a week, if they do only ten minutes' vigorous exercise twice a week.It's a prescription we can all take on board. 'Moderation in all things' has once again been shown to be the wisest option. "

They have described it as 'dangerous and ethically unacceptable'.However, others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers. According to a report by the National Post, Professor George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, says a paper outlining the technology is due to be published.He said: 'There is a paper from China. I don't think it's been accepted yet, but I think it will be at some point.'His comments match those made by several leading scientists working with non-reproductive stem cells who have raised concerns over the new technology.Until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells - non-reproductive cells like those found in skin, muscle, nerves, bone and liver for example - to help them study diseases.Modifying the DNA of human embryos so that DNA changes are preserved in the germline - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations.Such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the UK, but is permitted in the US and China.A number of groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos.Xingxu Huang, from Shanghai Tech University in China has been seeking permission to perform the technique on discarded human embryos after having successfully using it to modify monkey embryos that developed into live animals.Professor Church's own group is also said to be developing techniques that could be used to modify human embryos.Dr Luhan Yang, a scientist with Church's group, recently outlined proposals to edit the human germline in an interview with Technology Review.She proposed using immature egg cells from the ovaries taken from women undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer.The immature egg would be grown and coaxed into dividing before a gene-editing technique known as CRISPR would be used to correct the genetic fault that was causing the ovarian cancer.However, the project is not thought to be underway yet and it is not known if it has been approved.Dr Yang, however, has been reported to have been involved in a similar project in China. Last month a leading group of biologists called for a worldwide moratorium on germ line research amid rumours that it had already been used to alter human embryos in China.Edward Lanphier, chairman of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine in Washington DC, and four colleagues, wrote in the journal Nature that such research could harm other areas of science by provoking a public outcry. They wrote: 'It is thought that studies involving the use of genome-editing tools to modify the DNA of human embryos will be published shortly'In our view, genome editing in human embryos using current technologies could have unpredictable effects on future generations. 'This makes it dangerous and ethically unacceptable.'Such research could be exploited for non-therapeutic modifications.'We are concerned that a public outcry about such an ethical breach could hinder a promising area of therapeutic development, namely making genetic changes that cannot be inherited.'At this early stage, scientists should agree not to modify the DNA of human reproductive cells.'Their fears tap into concerns that such technology could be used to create 'designer families' where certain traits are selected for.In reality such selection can be difficult as often there is no single gene that provides a single trait and many genes have multiple functions. "
telegraph,6/10/2013 11:23,news,"Humans will be able to recreate alien life forms and 'print out' organisms using the biological equivalent of a 3D printer in the future, a DNA pioneer has predicted. Dr Craig Venter, who helped map the human genome, created the world’s first   synthetic lifeform, using chemicals and inserting DNA into the cell of a   bacteria. He believes scientists will soon be to do the same, designing basic organisms   to include features useful in farming or medicine, as well as sending robots   into space to read the sequence of alien life forms and replicate them back   on Earth. Writing in his latest book, Life at the Speed of Light: From the Double Helix   to the Dawn of Digital Life, he says: “In years to come it will be   increasingly possible to create a wide variety of [synthetic] cells from   computer-designed software.The creation of cells from scratch will open up extraordinary possibilities.” The scientist also predicts in the future machines will be able to analyse the   make up of genomes and transmit this through the internet or even space,   creating more possibilities in the search for alien life, the Sunday Times   reported. He wrote: “The day is not far off when we will be able to send a robotically   controlled genome sequencing unit to other planets to read the DNA sequence   of any alien microbe life that may be there. If we can . . . beam them back   to Earth we should be able to reconstruct their genomes.“The synthetic version of a Martian genome could then be used to recreate   Martian life on Earth.” In 2010 Dr Venter and his team made a new chromosome from artificial DNA in a   test tube, transferring it to an empty cell where it multiplied – the   definition of being alive. The multi-millionaire pioneer in genetics compared his work with making a   computer at the time, referring to the artificial DNA as the software. "
telegraph,5/1/2007 0:01,news,"Hundreds of thousands of patients with diseases of the nervous system will miss out on potentially life-saving new treatments if regulators ban experiments using part-human, part-animal embryos, scientists said yesterday.          The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) is next week expected to turn down applications from two teams of British researchers to transfer human cells into rabbit, cow and goat eggs.          Scientists want to create the hybrid embryos that would be around 99.9 per cent human and 0.1 per cent animal in order to produce embryonic stem cells - the body's basic building blocks that can grow into all other types of cells.          They hope to use stem cells to both understand and provide new treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cystic fibrosis, motor neurone disease and Huntington's.          Until now the process of creating an early embryo by putting human DNA into an egg that has its nucleus removed – known as therapeutic cloning – has been carried out using human eggs from consenting IVF patients. However, these are in short supply and success rates have been low.          Chinese scientists have shown it is possible to harvest stem cells from embryos created by transferring human cells into rabbit or cow eggs.          The UK-based researchers, led by Dr Stephen Minger at King's College, London, and Dr Lyle Armstrong at the North East England Stem Cell Institute, in Newcastle, stress the hybrid embryos would be destroyed by 14 days when they are no bigger than a pinhead.          Last month the Government published a White Paper that will form the basis for an overhaul of laws on fertility treatment and embryo research.          It included a proposed ban on the creation of embryos that are part-human, part-animal, with a provision to allow such research in certain conditions under licence.          Dr Minger said yesterday: 'Informally we have been told [by the HFEA] they are unlikely to grant permission for our applications.          'At present we have no therapies to even alleviate the symptoms for conditions such as Alzheimer's, spinal muscular dystrophy and motor neurone disease, never mind make an impact on disease progression.'          Prof Chris Shaw, a neurologist from King's College London, said: 'I think this technique has the potential for very important outcomes for patients. To shut this research down at the moment would be an affront to those patients.          The authority board will issue a policy statement that will inform its decision on the research licence applications at a meeting on Wednesday.          Opponents have described the proposed research as undermining 'the whole distinction between animals and humans'.          Josephine Quintavalle, the director of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: 'This kind of research makes people feel uncomfortable. There has been a groundswell of public concern and I think the HFEA has realised that.'"
telegraph,27/06/2000 00:00,news,"IN the language of those who enjoy a spot of genetic scaremongering, the Brave New World officially began yesterday.While the information gleaned from the human genome could revolutionise medicine, many believe the new era of genetics needs a new type of ethics. Some fear that concerns about the applications of this new knowledge are being ignored.Yesterday the Wellcome Trust, the charity which has invested £80 million in the human genome, admitted that it feared that the work could lead to individuals being disadvantaged because of their genetic make-up and said that this concern needed to be addressed by legislation.The Campaign Against Human Genetic Engineering - a group of researchers, scientists and doctors concerned about possible misuse of genetics - believes that politicians and the public have been fed too much hype.Dr Richard Nicholson, a member of CAHGE and the editor of the Bulletin of Medical Ethics, said it was an incredible achievement but added: 'Much like climbing Everest or getting to the North Pole by balloon, it's something which is of benefit to a few people but which is unlikely to be of benefit to the vast majority of mankind.'He believes that the medical advances promised by biotech companies have been blown out of all proportion. Precise gene therapy, where defective genes responsible for diseases and disorders are replaced, would be of value to very few people, he said. Despite a decade of research, there has been just one success story with gene therapy.He said: 'It will be expensive and it will be available only in the rich countries of the world.' Biotech companies have also talked about drugs being tailored to match a patient's individual genetic make-up, he said. However, the cost of developing such specific treatments will be prohibitive.One of the most immediate applications of the genome sequence could be improved genetic testing. Some ethicists are concerned that that could lead to pressures on parents to abort foetuses that do not pass a 'quality test'.Agnes Fletcher, of the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation, said one potential danger was the greater use of genetic testing in pre-implantation embryos. She said: 'Currently this is legally used to avoid single gene disorders and those affecting one sex only. This may spread to encompass 'desirable attributes' as well as what is now termed disease.'Some disabled people object to these procedures, viewing the creation of human life followed by its immediate termination on grounds of disability as discriminatory and a comment on the value of disabled children and adults.'Gene tests to predict future disease may be far harder for many diseases than biotech companies have admitted. Cystic fibrosis, for instance, has been linked to more than 1,000 different mutations. David King, a geneticist and editor of GenEthics News, said: 'The experience with Huntington's disease is that a very small proportion of those at risk of developing it put themselves forward for genetic tests, even when they are available.'Consequences of having the genetic test can be extremely variable. It doesn't automatically mean that someone having had the result of the test will modify their lifestyle in what we would say is a rational way.' Some might become fatalistic or profoundly anxious. Some might even end their lives, he said.The new era could also see genetic discrimination, and the possibility of a genetic underclass, unable to get insurance, private health care or employment. Dr King said: 'If privacy is not ensured and institutions are not restrained from using the information in their own interest, the result will be genetic discrimination.'The Association of British Insurers' code says that results of genetic tests already performed can be asked for, but can only be used in underwriting in limited circumstances. Insurers cannot demand genetic tests."
telegraph,26/04/2004 00:01,news,"Injections of adult stem cells can help repair failing hearts, according to the biggest and most definitive study of its kind.          Researchers say they have compelling evidence that bone marrow cells removed from the patients' own hip bones can treat one of the most common forms of heart disease.          Prof Robert Kormos, who led the University of Pittsburgh study, said: 'These results encourage us to pursue aggressively cellular therapies as an option for congestive heart failure. 'It will revolutionise our approach, which is largely palliative, to one that is truly regenerative.'          Stem cells are the body's 'parent cells' and can be programmed to become different kinds of tissue. Past studies on people and animals have shown that stem cells from adults influence the growth of new heart muscle and blood vessels.          The new study, presented yesterday at the American Association for Thoracic Surgery conference in Toronto, Canada, is the first to show their effectiveness in a major, random, clinical trial.          All 20 volunteers were suffering from severe heart failure - a condition when damaged heart muscle cannot pump blood properly. In Britain, around 650,000 people suffer from the condition.          During bypass operations, half were given injections of stem cells taken from their hips into 25 to 30 sites where heart muscle was damaged. Six months later the hearts of the stem cell group were pumping out more blood than those of patients who had surgery alone. None of the patients experienced any serious side-effects or complications.          Belinda Linden, of the British Heart Foundation, said: 'This is particularly significant as the incidence of heart failure is increasing. Most current treatments are aimed at relieving the symptoms; if we can actually repair the heart itself this will be a significant advancement. 'However, it must be remembered that this treatment is still experimental.'"
telegraph,9/9/2012 8:30,news,"Injections of stem cells taken from patients blood may finally banish wrinkles if clinical trials of a new treatment are successful.For some, wrinkles are seen as a sign of character. For most, they are an   unwelcome reminder of ageing. However, scientists are developing a method that may finally end the need for   the routine of treatments and moisturisers used to try to keep facial lines   at bay. The first clinical trials are to begin shortly on a treatment that uses stem   cells purified from a patient’s blood to combat their own wrinkles. The cells will be injected beneath the skin where they will grow into new skin   cells to help restore the elasticity, claims Pharmacells, the Glasgow-based   company behind the technology. Athol Haas, the company’s chief executive, said: “The skin has a natural   elastic property which comes from cells known as fibroblasts. “The ability of the body to produce this elastic material slows down with age   because the number of these fibroblasts decrease. “By introducing large numbers of stem cells into the right place, we are   increasing the ability of the body to produce this material. It is still in   its early stages but we hope to begin phase one trials within the next 12   months.”Until recently, anyone hoping to get rid of their wrinkles had to rely on   cosmetic treatments that injected synthetic collagen under the skin as a   filler to remove the lines. Botox has now become popular for cosmetic treatments, where a neurotoxin from   the bacteria Clostridium botulinum is injected to immobilise the muscles   that can cause wrinkles. Fibroblast cells produce collagen and help maintain the skin’s structural   integrity. Pharmacells, which will be conducting its first clinical trial with a clinic   in Hong Kong, uses a technique to purify an unspecialised type of cell,   known as blastocyst-like stem cells, which can develop into many different   types of tissues in the body. It will be the first therapy to use this type of cell and the company also   hopes to develop new techniques to treat diseases such as heart disease and   osteoarthritis. Rajiv Grover, a plastic surgeon and president elect of the British Association   of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said it could be five to 10 years before stem   cell treatments for wrinkles were widely available. “It is an exciting prospect as the science of stem cells will influence   plastic surgery and cosmetic medicine significantly in the future,” he said. “There is some evidence stem cells, when injected, can improve skin quality,   but until you have had studies that look at the long-term effect and the   safety, you cannot be sure.”"
telegraph,10/12/2006 0:01,news,"It is 16 years since the Government passed a law controlling IVF treatment and the creation of human embryos outside the body.          In that time, infertility rates have spiralled, with one in six couples now affected, and IVF has become a normal part of the reproductive process for growing numbers.                                        Scientists have made leaps in understanding, enabling them to screen out deadly diseases, prevent miscarriages and allow couples who would have remained childless to conceive. More than 8,000 babies annually are conceived with IVF and a record 30,000 women sought test-tube treatment last year, including more single women and lesbians than ever before.          The methods originally used to create test-tube babies are being applied and altered for controversial studies which led to the cloning of animals in the early 1990s.          These techniques have opened the door to research possibilities that involve combining human and animal embryos to help to understand and cure disease.          Critics of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority – the body set up to regulate IVF and embryo research – say it is being asked to make decisions in areas not on the horizon when it was established.          Against this backdrop, the Government has acknowledged the need to reform the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.          Last year it sought the public's views on areas for change, including sex selection, the need for an IVF child to have a father, surrogacy and the creation of so-called 'saviour siblings', as well as the creation of chimera embryos for research.          Some feel that the scientific world, while wanting to do good, is pushing at the boundaries of what is ethically acceptable with the quest to create these hybrids, which are either part-cow, part-human or part-rabbit and part-human, to get a plentiful supply of stem cells.          These are master cells that can turn themselves into different types of tissue. It is hoped they can be used to repair or replace diseased organs. Human eggs are in short supply and creating hybrids is seen as a way around this.          Scientists would use a simple skin cell from a patient and take the nucleus out of an animal egg, replacing it with the skin cell. Passing an electric current through it causes the egg to behave as if fertilised and it begins to grow into an embryo.          Josephine Quintavalle, of the campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, believes that in proposing a law that supports such experiments, the Government has taken a step down the 'slippery slope' towards meddling with the very fabric of what it means to be human.          The Government's command paper acknowledges that there is 'considerable public unease' over this issue, and the prospect that such hybrids could be brought to term.          Mrs Quintavalle said: 'Creating animal-human hybrids will cause widespread disgust and anger. It seems as if ministers are just giving in to what scientists want, without looking at the consequences.'          However, such tests raise the possibility of treatments and even cures for conditions such as motor neurone disease, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, which scientists and support groups say it would be unethical to deny.          Three groups of experts, from Newcastle, Edinburgh and London, have submitted applications to carry out such experiments in the hope of finding cures for motor neurone disease.          Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, the head of genetics at the Medical Research Council, welcomed the Government's go-ahead. 'By the time a baby is born with motor neurone disease, it is too late to study how the disease develops,' he said. 'If we can get embryonic stem cells in the laboratory, the work can be done.          'For research purposes, I don't see a problem at all with this, but it needs to be regulated. That is what the Government is proposing.'          Another area of controversy that will be covered by the new law is the issue of saviour siblings.          The HFEA's original opposition to this issue caused a public outcry during 2003 when the family of a three-year-old Charlie Whitaker, was forced to travel to the United States to create an IVF baby whose cord blood could be used to cure him of a life-threatening blood disorder.          Although the authority now allows families to carry out embryo screening in order to select a baby whose immune system is a good match for an existing sick child, ministers now say they will enshrine this right in law.          A key proposal, which will be welcomed by gay rights' groups, is for civil partners and other same-sex couples to be recognised legally as parents of an IVF child, in the same way as married or unmarried couples."
telegraph,15/11/2008 17:47,sport,"Lee Sweeney, professor of physiology at the University of Pennsylvania, is a popular man in the world of sport. He gets between five and 10 emails a week from athletes, some from Britain,   and so many phone calls that his secretary has stopped putting them through.   And that is in a quiet week. If he publishes an academic paper or does a media interview, a flurry of 50 or   more calls and emails usually follows, as it did 10 years ago when he first   revealed his 'mighty mice' to the world at a meeting of the American Society   for Cell Biology – laboratory mice with enormous muscles that retained their   strength and regenerative ability even when the animals reached old age. Sweeney's super-strong rodents were the product of his pioneering research   into gene transfer technology and the implications were clearly not lost on   the athletes and coaches who got in touch, one of whom offered $100,000 for   what the mice were getting. Shockingly, Sweeney also received a request from a high school American   football coach for his entire team to be genetically modified. Sweeney told him what he is still telling everyone a decade later, that   bulking up on gene therapy is not yet safe enough for humans and would   require heavy-duty immune suppression. He always gets the same response. 'Even if I explain to them that to make it work might require all sorts   of heroic measures, they basically say, 'Fine. I'll do it'. And if it's a   matter of money, they'll get the money.'Sweeney has never been contacted by a name he recognises – 'I don't   get Barry Bonds calling me up' – and says most of the would-be guinea   pigs appear to be young athletes trying to make the big time. 'Some of them are from Europe,' he says. 'I get quite a few   from the UK and Germany.'He says he would feel uneasy about passing on their names to the anti-doping   authorities but is sufficiently concerned to have accepted a seat on the   gene-doping panel of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), who are funding   eight research projects on gene-doping detection in a desperate attempt to   stay ahead of the cheats. Sweeney is bracing himself for another surge of calls and emails next year   when his work moves from the laboratory to the commercial world with a   muscle-building gene therapy for dogs. It will be available not only for dogs with muscular diseases but dogs that   are just old and immobile who, after an injection in their liver, could soon   be running around like puppies again. 'We are now in the final stages of getting all the approvals to offer   this through the veterinary hospital as a treatment to try to improve   strength in pet dogs,' he says. 'As the dogs get weak their owners get upset that they can't walk around   any more. So we're hoping that within the next year we will begin the era of   genetic enhancement in dogs.'Sweeney hopes his new canine anti-aging treatment will be just the start.   Humans have the same gene that Sweeney is manipulating in dogs and the next   step will be to treat people with serious genetic diseases such as muscular   dystrophy. Ultimately, he hopes to give the elderly, like the pampered   pooches of Pennsylvania, greater muscle strength and mobility in their final   years. But any breakthrough will inevitably be seized upon by dope cheats in the same   way that clinical drugs such as steroids, human growth hormone and the red   blood cell-boosting EPO soon found their way into kit bags. With the   prospect of as yet undetectable, lifelong enhancement, how could any drug   cheat resist? As gene transfer technology enters the medical mainstream as a treatment for   numerous diseases from blindness to cancer, scientists are agreed it is only   a matter of time before it crosses over into sport. Some predict that London 2012 could be the first genetically modified Olympic   Games. Others say the Beijing Games may already have that dubious honour. 'We do not have any proof that gene doping has been practised yet but we   have had signs that people are interested and they are looking at it,'   says Arne Ljungqvist, chairman of the International Olympic Committee's   medical commission. Evidence that sport is closing in on the science came two years ago when   German police discovered an email sent by Thomas Springstein, the disgraced   former coach of sprinter Katrin Krabbe, complaining about how difficult it   was to get hold of Repoxygen, a sophisticated agent for delivering EPO by   means of gene transfer. Springstein was later convicted of giving doping   substances to children. Cyclists are also beating at the door. A French gene expert, Professor   Philippe Moullier, had his eyes opened when a couple of former Tour de   France cyclists paid a visit to his laboratory in Nantes, where he is   experimenting on EPO genes in monkeys as a treatment for anaemia. The pair were working for an anti-doping organisation – or at least that is   what they told Moullier – and said they wanted to learn about his research. 'The thing that really surprised me was that when I told them it was just   the start of the technology, they told me that the riders would not care,'   says Moullier. 'They would go for it if they had a chance to be   undetectable. 'They said there were kids in the Tour de France who would do anything   just to have the most advanced technology. It's a concern because there are   still severe adverse side-effects. We are taking such care before it comes   to patients so we are scared to see guys who are ready to use it. It's   terrible.'If the risks are no deterrent, cheats still have to overcome the complexity of   gene modification, though if the BALCO conspirators were able to find a   biochemist capable of altering a molecule and synthesising a new designer   steroid, engaging the services of gene expert should not be beyond the wit   and wealth of an athlete determined enough to cheat. 'I think the real threat is from scientists and clinicians who decide   they want to make money off the athletes to make this available,' says   Sweeney. 'There are people in India and China who will do stem cell   transplantation in anyone who'll pay them. There is no evidence anything   they are doing has any effect on the patients but they'll do it for money.   At some point someone will say, 'I'll do immune suppression if you want me   to and I'll put in any gene you want'.'Sweeney admits that day could not be far away. 'The bottom line is that   we're going to be able to do genetic enhancement for serious diseases,'   he says. 'It's not beyond the realm of possibility that over the next   few years, if someone has sufficient help and sufficient motivation, it   could be done outside that arena.'"

telegraph,4/8/2005 0:01,news,"Man is now able to clone his best friend: this Afghan hound, Snuppy, is the world's first cloned puppy.          After years of failure, the humble mutt has been added to the wide range of animals that have been cloned by somatic-cell nuclear transfer - the method that produced Dolly the sheep - by Prof Woo-Suk Hwang, of Seoul National University.                                        Prof Hwang is the South Korean scientist who stunned the world last year with the first cloned human embryos.          The frisky copycat canine has the same floppy ears as his three-year-old genetic father, whose ear provided the skin cell from which Snuppy was cloned.           The advance will boost efforts to preserve rare species and pave the way for developing stem cell treatments for major dog diseases, then for human diseases.          But the struggle to create Snuppy underlines the dangers and dismal success rate of cloning. Scientists point out that the much publicised suggestion that cloning could be used to bring back a long dead pet is misguided.          The effort to clone dogs began in earnest in 1998, when John Sperling, an Arizona-based billionaire, gave a team at Texas A&M University a $2.3 million, two-year research grant to clone Missy, the bitch that he and his wife had adopted from an animal shelter. Spayed and of unknown parentage, it was otherwise impossible to continue her 'breed'.           The efforts of Prof Mark Westhusin and colleagues helped to lay the foundation of today's breakthrough. But, although his team succeeded in obtaining two pregnancies, all that resulted was a still-born clone of Missy, who died in 2002, aged 15.          One major problem, Prof Westhusin said yesterday, was the difficulty of producing mature, unfertilised canine eggs in a test tube, used to create a clone from one of Missy's cells. Another problem was the reproductive cycle of the dog.          'They only cycle once every six months to a year and there are no consistent, repeatable hormone treatments to synchronise dogs or get them to come into heat.'          Today, in the journal Nature, Prof Hwang's team reports the successful creation of two cloned Afghan hounds, although one died of pneumonia after 22 days. The surviving 19oz puppy, born on April 24, was named Snuppy, as in 'Seoul National University puppy', by Prof Hwang. He told The Daily Telegraph yesterday: 'The fur colour of the nuclear donor [the dog that was cloned] is similar to Snuppy's current fur colour,' adding that the coats of Afghans often change with age.           'The genetic tests confirm that Snuppy is a 100 per cent match to his genetic donor. At this time we can only go as far as to say that they seem to share some basic temperamental traits.'          'Snuppy is a perfectly frisky, healthy, rambunctious Afghan,' said co-author Prof Gerald Schatten, of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.          Dog eggs are difficult to work with because they are released from the ovary earlier than in other mammal species. Prof Hwang's team collected mature eggs from a dog's oviduct, the equivalent of the fallopian tube. These were reprogrammed with DNA from an Afghan hound to create cloned embryos.          The two puppies were the result of transferring 1,095 cloned embryos into 123 surrogate mothers - mixed breeds, in Snuppy's case a yellow Labrador retriever - leading to just three pregnancies, one of which miscarried. The practical uses in dog breeding remain distant since cloning is very inefficient.          Prof Westhusin pointed out how success depended on 'having hundreds, if not thousands, of dogs'. He added: 'Who knows how many additional dogs they had to select and collect eggs from to get enough to produce the 1,095 cloned embryos?'          Cloning can now be used to study the genetics of dog breeds and make it much easier to create genetically altered dogs, though Prof Schatten said that this was not an aim of this project. Nor are they interested in cloning pets.          'Nuclear transfer is an extraordinary tool for scientific and medical research. It has never been about reproductive medicine or making any members of our family, even our pets,' he said.          Prof Hwang hopes that the work could provide a key insight into the use of cloning to make chameleon cells, called stem cells, which can turn into any of the 200-plus types in the body.           There are high hopes that a range of serious diseases can be treated by using cloning to make brain, pancreas and other cells that are matched to a patient. Until now, however, so-called therapeutic cloning has been tried out only on inbred strains of mice.           Now that Prof Hwang's team had started to create lines of cloned embryonic stem cells from patients, 'we need to develop outbred models for therapeutic cloning, such as dogs', said Prof Schatten.          'The first beneficiaries of stem cell transplants might be our own best friends that suffer from numerous diseases and disorders like us, such as dementia, blindness, hip, joint failures, sleep disorders and diabetes.'          Prof Ian Wilmut, of the University of Edinburgh, who led the team that created Dolly and is to collaborate with Prof Hwang in developing stem cell treatments for motor neurone disease, congratulated the South Koreans.           'The result emphasises that it is necessary to optimise the method of nuclear transfer for each species. In this case it seems that success followed the use of a source of eggs that were likely to be of the highest quality. Prof Hwang and his colleagues allowed maturation to proceed in the dog before recovering eggs which had matured within the animal at the appropriate stage.'          The work further emphasises that there will be no fundamental barriers to using the technique to clone babies, only technical details.          However, Prof Wilmut said: 'There is a great need for a global ban on human reproductive cloning. Successful cloning of an increasing number of species confirms the general impression that it would be possible to clone any mammalian species given an optimised method. Ironically, it is the USA which does most to prevent the establishment of a ban while, at present, it would not be illegal to clone a person in some states of the USA.'           Dr Freda Scott-Park, the president-elect of the British Veterinary Association, said: 'No one should underestimate the consequences of this work.'"
telegraph,9/2/2001 0:00,news,"MAN will take charge of his own evolution within a few decades, when it will be possible to produce genetically modified people safely and predictably, according to the director of the United States National Human Genome Research Institute.Prof Francis Collins said humans are made up of fewer genes than was previously thought and by 2020 it will be possible to create GM humans with reasonable safety by 'germ line gene therapy'.Within another decade, this would lead to a 'chilling debate' about whether humans should alter their own biology. Prof Collins, one of the senior figure in the global effort to unravel the secrets of the human genetic code, was addressing senior scientists and politicians at the World Life Sciences Forum in Lyons.He predicted that, within a decade, most common disease genes would be known, general practitioners would begin to use genetic medicine, and widespread debate would be triggered by the use of pre-implantation diagnosis - where embryos can be screened for disease before implantation.Prof Collins forecast that by 2020 it would be possible to tailor drugs to suit an individual's genetic make-up to ensure that they do not cause side- effects, to design a cancer therapy to combat individual tumours in a patient and to make big advances in treating mental illness.'We are certainly close to understanding hereditary contributions to mental illness, to schizophrenia, to obsessive compulsive disorder, to autism, in a way that should lead us at last to a better biological understanding of the vexing problems and perhaps an opportunity to stop blaming the victims and treat them as victims of a disease that deserves compassion and better opportunities for therapy.'He believes that by 2020 it will be possible to repair genes before they are passed to the next generation. 'I wouldn't be surprised if in another 30 years some people will begin to argue that we ought to take charge of our own evolution and should not be satisfied with our current biological status.'However, he added: 'I find this an interesting but somewhat chilling discussion. I think from my own perspective that is an enterprise that I hope we would not undertake for a long time, if ever.'But Prof Collins gave a warning against genetic determinism, the mistaken belief that all human characteristics can be boiled down to DNA so that people are merely 'robots that are controlled by invisible signals from our DNA sequences'.He said: 'Understanding the human genome will not take away the concept of free will. Understanding the human genome will not help us very much to understand the spiritual side of humankind, or to know who God is or what love is.'The professor underlined this by explaining the perils of using genetics to enhance traits, given the profound influence of environment on behaviour. He described the example of rich parents who hoped to produce a baby genetically enhanced to be artistic and musical but ended up with 'a sullen adolescent who smokes marijuana and doesn't talk to them'.At the same time, computer simulations of human cells would be used in medical research to replace animal experiments, and the average human lifespan - in the developed world - would probably stretch to 90. There are a 'number of significant surprises' in the forthcoming human genetic code analysis, which will be published in Science and Nature next week in 36 papers.He said: 'We don't have as many genes as we thought we did.' The analysis will be a 'milestone of the highest order', said Prof Collins. He added that the finished human genetic sequence would be published in 2003."

Last week, as the company unveiled third-quarter figures in line with expectations, questions remained unanswered about the board's decision to eject its highly respected chief executive.Stahel, in the last nine years, has transformed Shire from a loss-making biotech into a healthy FTSE 100 constituent. Yet this is not sufficient to satisfy a group of US-based directors who want Shire to become a leading pharmaceutical company on the world stage. Without a credible leader it is hard to see it achieving this goal in the near future. While we have long been buyers of Shire, it is hard to maintain confidence in the group's strategy in the absence of anyone capable of executing it. The group also faces further generic competition to one of its top drugs, Aderall XR, for the treatment of hyperactive children. The shares have fallen since we last tipped them at 624p in May, but we feel it is time to cut losses and sell.SVBShareholders in SVB, the quoted Lloyd's underwriter, have had a bumpy ride over the past 18 months. Its shares have fallen more than 70 per cent to close at 37p. But it has secured new backers, including Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, and refocused its business, ditching marine insurance and reducing its exposure to the reinsurance market. So SVB appears to be getting back on track.This week the firm will announce the appointment of a new chief executive, Matthew Fosh. A former futures and options trader, Fosh sold his business to Michael Spencer's ICAP in 2000 before being linked with the top job at the London Stock Exchange. His appointment is a coup for the Lloyd's underwriter. SVB remains a risky bet, but brave readers may wish to punt on a Fosh-led turnaround. Speculative buy.Boots Earlier this year we advised readers to sell Boots (583.5p) when the shares stood at 643p. We argued that under Steve Russell, the chief executive, the retailer lacked a compelling strategy. Last week Boots announced interim results. Despite a fall in underlying profits, Russell says he is confident of achieving the City's forecasts for the full year. However, we continue to believe that his strategy is muddled. He has quietly reversed an earlier decision to pull out of toys and CDs and has scrapped plans to expand his latest high street initiative, standalone perfume shops. With no news expected on the future of Boots' Wellbeing, its foray into dentistry, chiropody and beauty treatments, until early next year, we remain nervous about Boots's prospects. Keep selling.Liberty InternationalInvestors in property should take note of recent figures comparing the relative performance of the three big segments of the market: shops, offices and industrial space. The most reliable indicators, from the Investment Property Databank, show that for the year to the end of September industrial property returned 7.3 per cent, office property 5.4 per cent and retail 10.1 per cent. Liberty International (570p), the UK's fifth largest property company, provides some of the best exposure to the UK retail sector. It owns the Metro Centre in Gateshead and Lakeside in Thurrock and last week raised nearly £160m from institutions to buy the Victoria Centre in Nottingham. Donald Gordon, the chairman, subscribed for 530,000 shares himself. The additional capital raised puts Liberty into contention for inclusion in the FTSE 100 index. Buy.Lok'nStore GroupTake a look at Lok'nStore Group (109p), the most attractive of the four quoted self-storage businesses. Lok'nStore is growing fast, with 35 new stores planned for the next four years. It has a low cost base, high margins and brings each new warehouse into profit swiftly. It is also highly defensive, with a diverse customer base, none accounting for more than 1 per cent of turnover. Experience in the US, where the market for self-storage is much more highly developed, is encouraging. In that market, demand dropped by just 6 per cent during the last recession. Indeed, the downturn is providing the opportunity for site acquisitions, as troubled businesses shed excess space. In July, the company raised £10m through an institutional placing and it is well funded to push ahead with its expansion. Turnover was up by 26 per cent this year to £5m. Buy.ReNeuronReneuron is the UK's only listed biotechnology company carrying out stem cell research. Clinical trials using human foetal cells could begin as early as 2004. Stem cell therapy - if successful - could revolutionise treatment for diseases of the central nervous system such as stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's by injecting foetal brain cells into patients. Martin Edwards, the chief executive, is likely to seek a merger with a well-funded US company looking to take advantage of Britain's more relaxed regulatory environment for stem cell research. In the US, lobbying by religious and ethical pressure groups has successfully blocked almost all research in this controversial area of science. At 10.5p, ReNeuron looks cheap. Buy.HeadwayHeadway (75p), the tiny property company, is a speculative buy. Its slightly larger rival, Country & Metropolitan, the housebuilder and property developer, upped its stake in Headway to 10 per cent on Friday. Headway believes that C&M is attempting to repeat the tactics it used when taking a stake in Tay Homes, the housebuilder. C&M put the company 'in play' and eventually flushed out a bid from Redrow, a rival housebuilder. C&M is backed by 'Black' Jack Dellal, the veteran property tycoon, and is capable of bidding on its own, but industry sources say there are other predators circling and that Headway's shareholders would rather take cash than C&M's paper.

MedImmune hopes that a set of its experimental drugs, which enhance the body's   immune response to tumour cells, can be made more powerful, and less risky   to healthy cells, by being dispatched directly to tumour cells by viruses.Oncolytic viruses are still a fairly nascent area of cancer research. No such   treatments are yet available in the West despite Chinese biotech Shanghai   Sunway winning the world's first approval for an oncolytic virus in 2005.   America's Amgen hopes to become the first company to win approval for an   oncolytic virus in the West after submitting its therapy to EU medicine   regulators in September.Dr Edward Bradley, senior vice president of research and development at   MedImmune, added that his company's drugs could in turn enhance the   cancer-killing abilities of Omnis's viruses.Stephen J.

Scientists have welcomed the move, which they say will speed up stem cell research leading to therapies and possibly even cures for diseases such as Parkinson's and Type 1 diabetes. To date their research has been limited by the number of stem cells they can obtain from human donors, a technically difficult task which is ethically unacceptable to many people.         Scientists have mainly used surplus embryos from in-vitro fertilisation.         They say the U-turn will enable them to create human-animal hybrid embryonic stem cells using rabbit or cow eggs.         Stem cells are valuable because they can be transformed into virtually any kind of body tissue.         The Human Tissue and Embryology Bill to allow the creation of the embryos is to be included in the Queen's Speech next month.          Prof Christopher Shaw, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College, London, said the switch was 'excellent news'.         However, campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics (Core) said the development was 'very worrying' because the regulator would simply 'rubber stamp' all applications."
dailymail,28/04/2015 00:21,wires,"MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — A Vermont law that could make the state the first in the country to require labeling of genetically modified food has been allowed by a federal judge to stand for now despite opposition by food industry groups.U.S. District Court Judge Christina Reiss in Burlington on Monday ruled against the Grocery Manufacturers' Association and other industry groups in their request for a preliminary order to block the law from going into effect as scheduled on July 1, 2016.The judge partially granted and partially denied the state's motion to dismiss the industry lawsuit, meaning the case is likely to go to trial.Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell, whose office finalized rules to implement the law on April 17, said in an interview, 'There's a lot of good news in this decision for us and for the heart and soul of the labeling law.'The Grocery Manufacturers Association said it was pleased the court 'found us likely to succeed on several of our claims' but was disappointed at the denial of its request for a preliminary injunction.'Manufacturers are being harmed, and they are being harmed now,' the association said in a statement. 'Act 120 is unconstitutional and imposes burdensome new speech requirements on food manufacturers and retailers.'The ruling comes nearly a year after Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin signed the law, under which Vermont is expected to become the first state to require genetically modified organism, or GMO, food labeling. Connecticut and Maine passed laws earlier but required that neighboring states follow suit before they would take effect.The Grocery Manufacturers Association was joined by the Snack Foods Association, the International Dairy Foods Association and the National Association of Manufacturers as plaintiffs in the lawsuit, seeking to have Vermont's law declared unconstitutional.Throughout the legislative and legal debate on GMO labeling, industry groups have argued that the First Amendment gives them broad discretion about what to include on their labels and that there's no compelling state interest to offset that.Supporters of the law have included consumer and environmental groups. Muslims and some Jews avoid pork, and concerns have been raised about pork genes being introduced into other foods.The judge found that the concerns embedded in Vermont's law were well within the state's purview.'The safety of food products, the protection of the environment, and the accommodation of religious beliefs and practices are all quintessential governmental interests, as is the State's desire 'to promote informed consumer decision-making,'' she wrote, quoting from the state's court filings.The court dismissed the industry groups' request that it apply a legal standard of strict scrutiny to the free-speech issues in the case, making it easier at trial for the state to rebut the companies' First Amendment claims. It also dismissed the plaintiffs' request that the law be found to violate the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.Conversely, Sorrell said the court made it clear the state would face 'an uphill battle' in defending a ban in the law on food companies labeling genetically modified food as 'natural.'"
telegraph,28/12/2012 18:47,news,"More than 100 Britons have taken a blood test to predict how long they have left to live, with dozens more expected to sign up to the new check next year. Around 1,000 people have taken the test globally with thousands of UK   customers to be targeted next year, Spanish manufacturer Life Length said.   By 2017 the company hopes to have dropped the price to just £65 per person. Tiny chemical structures in DNA called telomeres are analysed in the £650 test   and used to estimate the speed at which a person is ageing. Recent tests on animals have shown that high levels of short telomeres have   been an accurate indication of a reduced life expectancy. The structures rupture and shorten each time a cell divides meaning that a   higher number of short telomeres could be an indication of an increased rate   of cell splitting. However, critics of longevity tests say they are rarely accurate and often   give dubious results. A Nobel Prize-winning scientist recently told a newspaper the vast majority of   people would not gain any benefit from the test. “These people in the first percentile with the shortest telomeres are known to   be at risk of certain diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis or bone-marrow   failure. I’m not sure how the remaining 99 per cent will benefit,” said   Professor Carol Greider who won a Nobel Prize for her work on telomeres in   2009. Concerns have also been raised that the tests could eventually be mandated by   life insurance companies to calculate customers’ premiums. “Obviously as and when technology develops the insurers might look at it but   it would have to be reliable first and have some meaningful and accurate   assessment of risk attached to it,” said a spokesman for the Association of   British Insurers. “They always look at how reliable medical technology might be better used to   help assess risk.” The ABI also accepted that the tests could stray into the area of predictive   genetics, the use of which is banned for the purposes of calculating   premiums until at least 2017. “There’s a very strict industry code and a moratorium in place and insurers   also don’t want to put people off having tests in the mistaken belief that   they won’t get insurance,” said the ABI. “The general principle is that they   [the insurers] would only ever use developments in medical technology where   they provide accurate and meaningful data.” "
telegraph,4/9/2007 0:01,news,"Most people support the creation of early part-human, part-animal embryos for research into life-saving medical treatments, according to an opinion poll.         The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) will tomorrow rule on whether scientists should be allowed to create the hybrids in order to produce embryonic stem cells - the body's building blocks that grow into all other types of cells.         Two teams of British scientists are seeking permission to create cytoplasmic embryos, or cybrids, made using eggs from rabbits or cows that have had their nucleus replaced with genetic code from human cells.         These contain about 99.9 per cent human material and 0.1 per cent animal. The scientists want to use stem cells derived from them to increase understanding of and provide treatments for conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cystic fibrosis and motor neurone disease.         The HFEA commissioned a poll of more than 2,000 adults as part of a public consultation on the subject.         When asked simply whether they agreed with the creation of embryos containing mostly human and a small amount of animal material, 48 per cent of respondents were opposed and 34 per cent were in favour.         However, when the phrase 'if it may help to understand diseases such as Parkinson's and motor neurone disease' was added into the question, the picture was reversed with 61 per cent in favour and a quarter against.         Martin Rees, President of the Royal Society, said: 'The HFEA's consultation reveals welcome recognition of the potential of this research.         'Sixty-one per cent of the general public agreed with the creation of human-animal embryos - if it may help understand diseases - with only a quarter opposed to this research.         'It is heartening that the wider public agree with the scientific community that human-animal embryos offer the potential to better understand incurable illnesses such as Parkinson's and motor neuron disease.'         Meanwhile the Government has published a draft Human Tissues and Embryos Bill which would allow the creation of cybrids, but not so-called 'true hybrids' - created by fertilising a human egg with animal sperm or vice versa.         But a joint House of Commons and Lords committee scrutinising the draft Bill last month said all forms of hybrids should be allowed for research if regulators thought it beneficial.         Dr Robin Lovell-Badge, head of stem cell biology and developmental genetics at the National Institute for Medical Research, said: 'The scientific case for allowing research on cytoplasmic hybrids, has been well made.         'Among many reasons, without wasting valuable human eggs, it offers a way to derive embryonic stem cells corresponding to individual patients suffering from a genetic disease, such that the disease or potential therapies can be studied on cells in the lab - rather than on the patients themselves.'         The HFEA will still need to examine the specific applications made by the research teams from King's College London and the University of Newcastle after its general ruling tomorrow."

The proposed laws are contained within the controversial Human Fertilisation   and Embryology Bill, and will be debated in the House of Commons over the   next two days. Scientists claim that allowing the creation of hybrid human-animal embryos   could lead to treatments for some diseases. However religious leaders and   pro-life groups say that hybrid embryos threaten the sanctity of human life. Mr Leigh said creating hybrid embryos was ethically and medically wrong, and   claimed the legislation would turn the UK into a scientific 'rogue state'. 'There is no overwhelming, or indeed any large scale body of scientific   evidence to suggest that this research, that does cross this ultimate   boundary between humans and animals will actually cure anything. 'We do not believe that regulation is enough. We believe this is a step   too far and therefore should be banned.'Mr Leigh was challenged in a series of interventions from Labour backbenchers. Chris Bryant, a former Anglican curate, compared Mr Leigh's arguments to those   used by church leaders against the smallpox vaccine. 'They were wrong and I think you are wrong today,' Mr Bryant said. Tonight's vote will be the climax of the first in a series of highly-charged   debates. The most contentious vote, on whether to lower the legal abortion   limit from 24 weeks, will come tomorrow evening. A coalition of Britain's leading medical charities has urged MPs to approve   stem cell research using human-animal hybrid embryos. The open letter, whose signatories include the Parkinson's Disease Society and   the British Heart Foundation, says that allowing the creation of hybrid   embryos could lead to crucial advances in the treatment of a range of   serious diseases. The Prime Minister added his support to the move, arguing that it had the   potential to save 'millions of lives.'Tonight's vote is on the creation of hybrid embryos to enable further research   into a number of serious conditions. Under the process, the nuclei of human cells are inserted into animal eggs,   creating hybrid embryos which are allowed to grow for a few days. Stem cells can then be harvested and used to create brain, skin, heart and   other tissue for treating diseases before the embryos are destroyed. Gordon Brown, whose youngest son suffers from cystic fibrosis, one of the   conditions which scientists hope may be treated as a result of the research,   launched a passionate defence of the Bill, on which Labour MPs have a free   vote. In an article in the Observer, he described the research as an 'inherently   moral endeavour', adding: 'I believe we owe it to ourselves and   future generations to introduce these measures.' Religious leaders were unified in their unhappiness over the Bill. In a joint statement, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor   and Cardinal Sean Brady said: 'Not nearly enough time has been given to   discussing these issues and these questions require answers before and not   after legislation. Other emerging techniques hold potential for good,   without creating and destroying human embryos.' "

A lack of the protein in melanocyte stem cells leads to grey hair, according   to a team of researchers from New York University Medical Centre, writing in   journal Cell. Professor Mayumi Ito said that genetically manipulating the Wnt signalling   proteins could stop hair turning grey, and that her team had found a method   to successfully restore hair colour in mice. Prof Ito said: 'We have known for decades that hair follicle stem cells   and pigment-producing melanocyte cells collaborate to produce coloured hair,   but the underlying reasons were unknown.

Doctors at London's Royal Brompton Hospital said the scheme would provide a   greater understanding of the gene components an individual inherits which   can can cause some diseases. The project involves sequencing all 22,000 genes found in the human genome.   Genes are made up of DNA which tell the body which chemicals to make,   controlling various aspects of the body's looks. Faulty genes cam make people more likely to develop some diseases. The parts of a person's DNA that makes up all their genes are called the   exome. Genes only represent about one per cent of the entire human genome   but contain most of the important information necessary for diagnosing   inherited disease. A total of 10,000 patients are being studied at the hospital which specialises   in the treatment of heart and lung disease. They will be studied over ten   years. The National Institute   for Health Research is funding the project which is being led by   Professor Dudley Pennell, director of the cardiovascular magnetic resonance   unit at the Royal Brompton and professor of cardiology at Imperial College   London.

Researchers found that on-going weakness caused by a heart attack could be   improved with an injection of one million stem cells. The cells were taken from healthy areas of the patients' own hearts, the first   time this has been done. The researchers from Harvard Medical School and University of Louisville said   it could represent 'the biggest revolution in cardiovascular medicine in my   lifetime'. There are one million people in Britain suffering with heart failure, caused   when areas of damage to the heart muscle cause it to weaken and beat less   efficiently. It causes breathlessness and fatigue and current treatments are   only aimed at easing the symptoms rather than repairing the damage to the   heart. Dr Roberto Bolli of the University of Louisville and Dr Piero Anversa at   Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston conducted   the study, published in The Lancet medical journal and presented at the   American Heart Association's annual scientific meeting in Florida. Dr Bolli said: 'The results are striking. 'If these results hold up in future studies, I believe this could be the   biggest revolution in cardiovascular medicine in my lifetime.'Dr Anversa said: 'Seeing these cells given successfully to very sick   patients is the most rewarding experience that a physician-scientist can   have in his or her lifetime.'However both warned that larger scale studies were needed to establish how   effective the technique is and how it compares to previous methods using   stem cells taken from bone marrow. In the study, named Scipio, 14 patients who had heart failure caused by a   heart attack were given an infusion of their own cardiac stem cells and   others received nothing for comparison. The cells were removed from healthy parts of the heart during heart bypass   surgery and purified and grown in the laboratory until each patient had one   million cells. Four months after surgery the cells were injected into the heart. Readings   were taken of the heart's pumping capacity before and at intervals   afterwards. There was an improvement after four months but after one year there was a 12   per cent increase on average in the pumping capacity of the heart. Scans revealed that the damaged areas of the heart had shrunk. Prof Michael Schneider, chairman in Cardiology at the National Heart and Lung   Insistute, who has been working in this area at Imperial College London,   said the findings were 'exciting'. 'This is a very exciting and gratifying first step. 'If these results, including both safety and the strong indication of   effectiveness, hold true in larger studies then it will represent a major   improvement, not only over and above exisiting standard care but also in   surpassing the bone marrow cell trials.'He said the 'holy grail' of this work would be to stimulate stem cells to grow   into new heart muscle without having to remove them from the patient's   heart. In a linked commentary in The Lancet, Professor Gerd Heusch, of the University   School of Medicine, in Essen, Germany, said: “The results from SCIPIO raise   new optimism because the study is based on rigorous quality standards and   the reported benefits are of an unexpected magnitude…we will have to see   whether further data will meet the promises of the present study: more   patients will need to be followed up over a longer period.”Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation   said: 'Unlike many previous studies, this research has used cells   derived from the patients' own hearts, rather than from blood or bone   marrow. 'Their preliminary findings, in a small number of patients, showed a   modest improvement in heart function - this is similar to those reported in   other cell therapy studies. 'This is positive, but the crucial next steps are to see whether this   improvement is confirmed in the final completed trial, and to understand   whether the cells are actually replacing damaged heart cells or are   secreting molecules that are helping to heal the heart.'

In their study, the researchers from the Nara Institute of Science and   Technology, Japan, transplanted “neural stem cells” (NSCs) to mice with   severe spinal cord injuries. They then administered a drug known as valproic acid, which is used in the   treatment of epilepsy. The acid promoted the transplanted stem cells to generate nerve cells, rather   than other brain cell types. The team, reporting in the Journal of Clincal Investigation, concluded that   the “combination therapy resulted in impressive restoration of hind limb   function”. Prof Kinichi Nakashima, who led the study, said the method could be developed   as an effective treatment for severe spinal cord injuries, giving hope to   paralysed patients. “The body’s capacity to restore damaged neural networks in the injured… is   severely limited,” he said. “Although various treatment regimens can partially alleviate spinal cord   injury, the mechanisms responsible for symptomatic improvement remain   elusive. “These findings raise the possibility that (stem cells)… can be manipulated to   provide effective treatment for spinal cord injuries.”But Tamir Ben-Hur, from Hadassah Hebrew University Medical School, Israel,   said while the study showed “impressive” results, he cautioned that further   work was needed “before it can be determined whether this approach will work   in human patients”.

telegraph,3/12/2014 12:29,technology,"Personal genetics company 23andMe has launched in the UK, analysing customer's DNA for genetic risk factors for conditions including Alzheimer's Disease and hereditary cancers Personal genetics company 23andMe has launched in the UK, giving you the   chance to examine not only your genetic health and ancestry, but also traits   and predilections you have have thanks to your genes. From a simple saliva sample, more than 100 detailed genetic reports are   generated and stored in an online database. While not intended to diagnose disease, the £125 testing kit can flag up   genetic risk factors including Alzheimer's Disease, hereditary breast and   ovarian cancer and Parkinson’s disease, alongside how you may react to drugs   used to treat epilepsy and Hepatitis C. It can also reveal if you're a carrier of a recessive genetic variant for   conditions including cystic fibrosis, polycystic kidney disease and sickle   cell anaemia, which could be passed on to future offspring. The company, which is part-funded by Google,   uses genotyping technology to identify the specific genetic variants within   an individual's genome which contain interesting information about their   health and heritage. A US laboratory extracts DNA from the customer's saliva sample and places it   on an Illumina genotyping chip before incubation. Incubation encourages the   hybridisation process, in which the DNA attaches itself to beads on the   chip. The chip is then analysed by a computer, which sends the extracted and   encrypted data to 23andMe. Co-founder Anne Wojcicki said the service was intended to help people learn   more about themselves in an private and accessible way. 'Among the traits we can flag up is whether you have a genetic   predisposition towards either loving coriander, or thinking it tastes like   soap,' she said. 'There are also others for detecting whether you   have 'dry' or 'wet' earwax, how you metabolise caffiene and the genetic   reasons behind why you may be a more frequent smoker.'Ms Wojcicki said her goal for the company was to 'fundamentally change   the healthcare system' by placing the individual at the centre of their   own care and treatment, and empowering them with the knowledge the tailored   reports provide. 'Science should be accessible to everyone, and our mission is to help   individuals to access, understand and benefit from the human genome.'23andMe users can choose to share their anonymised data with researchers in   the world's largest online genetic research platform of more than 600,000   sets of data, or with their GP or family. Users also have the potential to discover and communicate with relatives   through the DNA Relatives feature. The company's personal genome service was banned from advertising its personal   genome service by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2013 due to   concerns over the accuracy of the data gathered. A source at the Department of Health (DoH) said the product being offered in   the UK has a CE mark - meaning it meets legal requirements - and added that   23andMe is following principles set out by the Human Genetics Commission in   2010 on direct-to-consumer genetic testing. A DoH spokeswoman said: 'This Government is developing the use of   genomics for patient care within the NHS. 'We welcome initiatives that help to raise awareness of genomics and   those which enable people to take more interest in their personal health but   we urge people to think carefully before using private genomic services as   no test is 100 per cent reliable.'Around 10,000 UK-based customers have already paid extra to have the kit   delivered from the US.

Sir John Bell, professor of medical sciences at Oxford University, adviser on   genetics to the government and chair of its human genomics strategy group,   made his comments as David Cameron launched a national DNA database of up to   100,000 patients with cancer or rare diseases. Sir John said: 'The price of genome sequencing has been falling off a   clliff. It has fallen by 100,000-fold in 10 years. We are headed for £100 a   genome. That will happen in the very near future.' He told Radio 4's Today programme that that means everybody's genetic make up   would therefore be available if they wish it to be.  'Genetics is a key component of all common diseases,' he said.  'There is a possibility that this will help in a whole variety of ways   including the use of new drugs.' The UK will be the first country to introduce hi-tech DNA mapping within a   mainstream health system in a move designed to help it lead the world in   tackling cancer and rare diseases, Downing Street said. But campaigners warned the project, in which patients will have to opt out of   having their personal DNA code sequenced if they do not wish to be involved,   comes with “very real privacy concerns”. If extended to the whole population, individuals and their relatives could be   identified and tracked by matching their DNA to their genome stored in   health care records in a move which could “wipe out privacy”, GeneWatch UK   said. Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats opposed plans for a DNA   database put forward under Labour, in part due to concerns over civil   liberties. But up to 100,000 patients over three to five years will now have their   personal DNA code sequenced, anonymised and stored to increase doctors’   understanding of their genetic make-up, condition and treatment needs, and   help develop potentially life-saving new drugs. Mr Cameron said: “By unlocking the power of DNA data, the NHS will lead the   global race for better tests, better drugs and above all better care. “We are turning an important scientific breakthrough into a potentially   life-saving reality for NHS patients across the country. “If we get this right, we could transform how we diagnose and treat our most   complex diseases not only here but across the world, while enabling our best   scientists to discover the next wonder drug or breakthrough technology.” Mapping the human genome for the first time in 2000 cost about £500 million,   but it will soon be able to be done for less than £1,000, clearing the way   for personalised medicines and individualised treatments, Downing Street   said. An extra £100 million will also be invested in research and development to   attract firms in the synthetic biology market, worth a potential 100 billion   US dollars (about £62.4 billion), to the UK. Campaigners Big Brother Watch added the opt-out system for research was   “wholly wrong”, warning that marketing firms could try to use the data to   sell medication to people at risk of becoming ill.

telegraph,16/01/2008 20:00,news,"Pioneering transplants to restore the sight of people affected by the leading cause of blindness in the Western world could start in three years, after successful human cell implants in pigs.          The animals look a little human, now that they have a lawn of human cells growing in an area about size of about half of a little fingernail at the back of their eyes, which are ideal for testing treatments before they are used on people.          More than 500,000 people in the UK have irreversible blindness caused by macular degeneration and it is estimated that one third of the population could be affected by 2070.          The disease is marked by a progressive loss of central vision due to degeneration of the macula - a pigmented spot at the back of the retina.          Now the first success has been recorded by a London-led team given £4 million by an anonymous American philanthropist, who saw his father go blind, towards the cost of developing a stem cell therapy, where cells taken from a surplus human IVF embryo are used to repair the eye.          Prof Pete Coffey and Lyndon da Cruz, an eye surgeon, of the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, have teamed up with Prof Peter Andrews, of the University of Sheffield, to take the treatment into hospitals. The pig tests mark a milestone.          'The results are really encouraging,' says Prof Coffey. 'We plan to do the first patient within three years.'          Using surgical instruments introduced through three one millimetre holes in the eye, the team goes under the retina, a translucent layer, then inflate it so it separates from the underlying cells.          The human eye cells derived from embryonic cells were then introduced on a rolled up patch and injected through a one millimetre hole, where the patch of human cells unfolded under the retina.          'I was over the moon when I got the results because it is a proof of concept,' says Prof Coffey. 'We really can do it.'          Although the implanted human cells are black, the same as the surrounding pig cells, they can be distinguished when light of a given colour is shone into the eye. The human cells glowed when viewed this way under the gaze of an instrument called a scanning laser opthalmoscope. 'That indicates good function,' says Prof Coffey.          The operation on three sighted pigs took only 30 minutes, suggesting the stem cell implants could eventually become a routine outpatient operation, they told an event backed by the company Mostra at the Globe Theatre to promote the London Project to Cure Blindness - a scientific initiative between UCL, Moorfields and The University of Sheffield.          Although it has already raised £4 million for the work, the team has failed to raise matching funding from the troubled UK Stem Cell Foundation to fully develop the treatment. 'The main issue is to raise more funding,' says Prof Coffey. 'If we do not get the money it will seriously slow down the project.'          As a human trial run for the operations, the team has also repaired the vision of four out of 12 patients with the wet form of macular degeneration by moving around their own tissue within the eye.         They told the meeting that the method has now also been tested on in five with the dry form, with tissue from their own eyes, moving it from the region of the eye responsible for peripheral vision to repair the damaged macula.          The treatment is not initially aimed at the transparent skin of nerve cells that detect light but at an underlying carpet of cells called the retinal pigment epithelium, or RPE.         RPE was transplanted by surgeons, without the use of stem cells. in an experimental procedure using RPE taken from another site in their own retina. However, moving around RPE in what are long, complex operations is of limited benefit in treating common eye diseases such as macular degeneration.          Prof Coffey has now found a way to turn stem cells taken from early human embryos surplus to test tube baby clinicinto RPE cells by adding growth factors and it was these derived human RPE cells that were implanted into the eyes of the pigs.         'Now we have to get clinical grade cells produced, which is under way in Sheffield for phase one trials,' says Prof Coffey."
telegraph,11/10/2012 19:23,news,"Professor Keith Campbell, who has died aged 58, was the man primarily responsible for the scientific breakthrough that led to the birth of the cloned sheep, Dolly. Dolly, so named because she was cloned from a mammary cell, something the   scientists associated with the bosomy singer Dolly Parton, was born on July   5 1996. News of the animal’s existence was not made public until February   the following year, when it immediately created a media sensation.   Excitement was intense, but was soon shrouded by moral and ethical questions   and, inevitably, speculation about how long it would be before human clones   were walking the streets. Headlines warned of “armies of Hitlers”. Campbell took such scaremongering with a pinch of salt. “It’s science fiction   and The Boys From Brazil and it’s a good story,” he said a few years later.   Such stories, he said, did not take into account the fact that people are   shaped by environment as well as genetics. “If you had 40 Adolf Hitlers that   had been cloned, they’d probably be nice guys,” he noted reassuringly. The nature of the cloning breakthrough with Dolly was also more complicated   than it first appeared. For scientists had long been able to clone animals –   and humans – from embryonic cells. In 1993, for example, embryologists in Washington took cells from 17 human   embryos. The embryos were formed of just a handful of cells, which the   scientists separated before growing each one separately until they were   large enough to be implanted in a woman. This did not happen, but if it had,   the resultant foetuses would technically have been clones. The difference between this experiment and that behind Dolly the sheep was   that it is relatively simple to make a clone from embryo cells, which are   able to develop into any other kind of cell – from a brain cell to shinbone   cell. However, once embryonic cells have made this transition into specific,   adult, cells (or become differentiated, as it is known), they are barred by   proteins from developing in other ways. Thus, though each differentiated   cell carries the genetic blueprint for the whole organism, the information   not directly relevant to its task is locked away. This was the hurdle that Campbell and his colleague Ian Wilmut faced as they   worked on cloning animals from a single, differentiated, adult cell: they   needed to activate the rest of the genetic information it contained. In   Dolly’s case they need the udder cell to develop into an entire sheep, not   just more udder cells. To achieve this Campbell drew on a method he had used to clone two sheep from   embryo cells in 1995 – Megan and Morag. This involved starving the cell of   nutrients, making it “quiescent”. In this state all the cell’s genetic   information has the potential to develop. A sheep egg cell contains proteins   that would, he realised, activate this potential for development, “switching   on” all the genes in the cell, not just the genes related to its specific,   differentiated, role. A total of 430 eggs were surgically removed from ewes and given to the   technicians Bill Ritchie and Karen Mycock. Each egg was then stripped of its   DNA and filled with the udder cell. The egg and the cell were then fused   with an electric current. This was done successfully in 270 of the 430   cases, and of these 270, 29 grew into the precursors of embryos known as   blastocysts. Only one of these 29 developed successfully inside a surrogate   mother. Five months later, Dolly was born. For the scientists, the achievement opened up a new world of positive   possibilities, far removed from the nightmarish prospect of hordes of   Hitlers imagined by journalists. The researchers’ goal was to create sheep   and cows whose milk could contain human proteins – proteins containing amino   acids, say, or Factors VIII and IX, with therapeutic uses for patients from   newborn babies to haemophiliacs. They also hoped that animals could be   farmed to develop organs that can be transplanted into people without   rejection. Inserting human genes into animal embryos (which are then known as   “transgenic” animals) for such beneficial purposes had always been a hit and   miss process. Campbell and Wilmut thought that a much better method would be   successfully to develop a single transgenic sheep in the usual, laborious   and difficult manner, then, once it was mature, clone it. The two men did   just this later in 1997, with the birth of Polly and Molly, transgenic sheep   cloned from differentiated cells. Over time, they speculated, this process would lead to flocks of sheep with   therapeutic potential to treat a host of different diseases and deficiencies   in people. It was little wonder that the development made overnight stars of   the team behind Dolly. Ian Wilmut took the lion’s share of the acclaim. Owing to a prior arrangement   with Campbell, his was the lead name on the paper about Dolly submitted to   Nature. Campbell came second, and Ritchie and Mycock were acknowledged only   in the small print. This later caused some resentment, and in a court case in 2006 Wilmut admitted   that he had only “a coordinating role” in the Dolly project, and   acknowledged that Ritchie had carried out the actual experiments. Meanwhile,   the scientific breakthrough was largely down to Campbell, he said, and it   was Campbell who deserved “66 per cent” of the credit for Dolly. Keith Campbell was born on May 23 1954 in Meriden, near Birmingham. He grew up   there and in Perth. After school he qualified as a medical laboratory technologist, specialising   in microbiology, before attending Queen Elizabeth College London, where he   graduated with a BSc in Microbiology. It was during his time there that he   began to focus on cell cycles and cell growth. He then briefly moved to Yemen to fill a locum position as chief medical   laboratory technologist before returning to work on a programme at   Alfriston, Sussex, to eradicate Dutch Elm Disease. After joining the Marie   Curie Institute, which furthered his interest in cell growth, in 1983 he was   awarded a Marie Curie research scholarship, which allowed him to attend the   University of Sussex as a postgraduate student. His DPhil thesis was   entitled “Aspects of cell cycle control in Yeast and Xenopus”. He took up two postdoctoral positions in Scotland then, in 1991, joined the   Roslin Institute, where he began to apply himself to the production of   mammalian embryos by nuclear transfer. Four years later Megan and Morag were   born. Campbell left Roslin the same month, July 1997, that the birth of Polly was   announced. Aiming to further the development of human therapies in   transgenic animals, he became head of embryology at PPL Therapeutics. In   March 2000 PPL produced the world’s first cloned piglets. By then Campbell had left to become, in November 1999, Professor of Animal   Development at the University of Nottingham, where he continued to work on   cloning. Cambell was an editorial board member on several journals, including Cell   Reprogramming and the Journal of Reproduction and Development. In 2008 he shared the Shaw prize for Medicine and Life Sciences, worth $1   million, with Ian Wilmut and Shinya Yamanaka. Keith Campbell is survived by his wife, Kathy, and two daughters.

telegraph,3/1/2007 0:01,news,"Professor Roland Levinsky, who died in an accident on New Year's Day aged 63, was an international leader in the field of immunodeficiency diseases, working in bone marrow transplantation, stem cell biology and gene therapy; as vice-chancellor and chief executive of the University of Plymouth he was also a fearless and controversial administrator.          In his career as a physician, Levinsky performed the first successful bone marrow transplants at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children in London in 1979. He also helped initiate international collaborations which ultimately led to the discovery of the genetic basis of several primary immunodeficiency diseases.          Levinsky understood the power that could be unleashed by the molecular biology and genetics revolutions of the late 1970s, and was one of the first scientists in Britain to obtain funding for gene therapy clinical trials which have since proved successful at Great Ormond Street in treating lethal immunodeficiency conditions.           On his appointment at Plymouth University in 2002, Levinsky announced plans to close down outlying colleges. He found himself confronting entire local communities, but faced down the west country 'Establishment'. He even received a death threat as he sought to achieve his aim of locating the university on one central site. Resistance was especially fierce when he tried to close Seale Hayne (the agricultural college near Newton Abbot) and Rolle College (the university's education campus at Exmouth).          'My ideal university is a place where arts and sciences talk to each other,' Levinsky explained. 'I had campuses which did not.' Nevertheless, farmers and members of the House of Lords who had learned their agriculture at Seale Hayne rallied opposition to Levinsky's vision, receiving support from the Prince of Wales. A female student issued a death threat to Levinksy on the telephone in the middle of the night. She claimed it was a prank, and having been disciplined was allowed to stay at the university. She was later awarded her degree.          Some local farmers joined in the campaign of abuse, threatening to dump manure on his drive. Nothing came of these threats, however, and Levinksy eventually prevailed. A physically towering figure, he was as bullish as he was blunt.          Roland Jacob Levinsky was born on October 16 1943 in Bloemfontein, South Africa, his Communist father having fled there from Nazi persecution on the Lithuania/Poland border. When Roland was 13 his father died; while still a teenager he emigrated to Britain with his British-born mother and two elder siblings.          Although he intended to study Medicine, he was inspired by the biologist JZ Young to take a first degree in Physical Anthropology at London University. Levinsky went on to read Medicine at London before training as a paediatrician.          He worked on kidney disease at a children's hospital in Philadelphia, acquiring expertise in immunology, the study of the body's immune system. Returning to London, he took research posts at the Institute of Child Health, attached to the Great Ormond Street Hospital, first as reader in Paediatric Immunology and later as Hugh Greenwood Professor of Immunology, heading a research group of 60 people working on bone marrow, stem cells and gene therapy.          During his 10 years as dean of the Institute between 1989 and 1999, Levinsky transformed the fortunes of a declining establishment to create a world-class research and teaching institution. When it merged with University College, London, Levinksy became head of medicine and deputy vice-chancellor.          In 1999 he was appointed vice-provost for biomedicine and head of the graduate school at UCL. In this capacity Levinsky chaired a steering committee to establish good practice guidelines in postgraduate education. During his time there he also successfully negotiated the funding for a major new cancer research institute.          A warm, engaging man with a subversive sense of humour, Levinsky was interested in the arts as well as the sciences; before becoming vice-chancellor at Plymouth, he took a part-time master's degree in History because he 'wanted to see what it was like to be a student again'.          Levinksy was the author or co-author of more than 250 scientific papers and edited two books on immunodeficiency diseases.          A skilled amateur sailor — inspired, perhaps, by a spell as a ship's surgeon in the liner Oriana — he was a qualified master mariner who competed in a transatlantic race at the helm of his own 43-ft yacht.          As a talented potter who crafted ceramics in his own kiln, Levinsky was a driving force behind Peninsula Arts, Plymouth University's umbrella organisation that aims to transform the city's cultural life. He was closely involved in plans to create a cultural quarter around the university campus.          Roland Levinsky died when he was hit by a falling power cable while he was walking his dog near his home.          He is survived by his wife, Beth, a teacher whom he married in 1970, and by their son and two daughters."

The company will have an anticipated value of £30m if it floats again, sources said.

telegraph,1/9/2007 0:01,news,"Research using hybrid embryos is likely to be given the go-ahead this week after warnings it would be a major blow to British science if the Government watchdog refused to allow it.                                       The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) will decide on Wednesday whether to permit scientists to create human-animal hybrid embryos to extract stem cells for research.         The studies could yield new treatments for diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease.         Early indications are that the HFEA will approve the concept in principle, but it still has to decide on two specific applications from university scientists - rulings which will come later this year.         Dr Stephen Minger, from King's College London, has applied to the HFEA to create embryos using eggs taken from cows which have had their genetic material removed and replaced with human cells.         The aim is to create stem cells which can be manipulated in the laboratory to mimic human cells with genetic neurological diseases so potential therapies can be developed.         The only other alternative, Dr Minger said, is to encourage thousands of women to donate their eggs for research. 'Ruling against this research would be a real blow for science, not just stem cell research,' he said.         'We thought that what we were doing was quite pragmatic. It is more justified than trying to encourage thousands of young women to come forward to undergo a fairly invasive procedure for research. In my opinion that is not realistic and not justified.'         Another application has been submitted by Dr Lyle Armstrong and his team at Newcastle University to carry out basic research using stem cells taken from hybrid embryos.         Hybrids have already been created in China and if the HFEA rules in favour of the principle on Wednesday the two British applications will be put before its licence committee in November.         A row erupted last year after a Government White Paper proposed banning the technique following a backlash from a public consultation.         Scientists warned the consultation had been skewed by pro-life groups and so the HFEA carried out its own.         In the meantime, the Government has published a draft Bill which would allow hybrid embryos created using cloning techniques but not 'true hybrids' where a human egg is fertilised with animal sperm or vice versa.         The joint scrutiny committee said this should be removed and research allowed on all hybrids.         Phil Willis, the Liberal Democrat MP for Harrogate and Knaresborough who is chairman of the committee, said it was likely the final Bill will be amended to reflect this before it went to MPs.         He said: 'It would be fairly logical for the HFEA to go ahead and decide these licences.'         The Government's chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, is a high-profile dissenter.         He has said that mixing human cells with animals cells should not be permitted and it has been suggested that if the research is allowed he may have to resign.         Mr Willis said: 'Liam Donaldson has taken a very hard line on this. To have the CMO talking about 'yuk' factors is not acceptable.'"
telegraph,28/04/2013 10:45,news,"Scientists are trying to create a ‘health and safety’ cow by genetically modifying the animals to have no horns, in order to reduce the risk of injuring farmers, walkers and other creatures.Researchers are using gene-editing techniques to insert a DNA patch into the   genome of Holsteins, Britain's foremost dairy breed, to suppress horn   growth. The extra DNA has been taken from other breeds of cattle to create a dairy cow   that is identical in every respect to existing livestock but without the   horns. Preventing horn growth would eliminate the need for many farmers to burn off   the horn buds of calves in what is a difficult and intensely painful   procedure for the animals. Mansel Raymond, chairman of the National Farmers' Union Dairy Board for   England and Wales, and who keeps 600 Holsteins on his Pembrokeshire farm,   said: 'The worst thing is the pain for the calf once the anaesthetic   wears off. “So it would be very positive to create hornless cows. It would save a lot of   time for us and pain for the calf. Everybody wins.'Cattle remain among the most dangerous of livestock, with five farmworkers   killed and 91 injured by cattle in 2010-11, according to the Health and   Safety Executive. Two members of the public were also killed, and 17 more   seriously injured. Geoff Simm, a professor of animal breeding who chairs the government's Farm   Animal Genetic Resources Committee, said: “This would be a major advance in   animal welfare.”Simm, who has championed the idea in a report on livestock genetics just   published by Defra, the food and farming ministry, said the proposal is   based on research into gene editing at the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh. The technique is a new form of genetic engineering that lets scientists make   precise changes to DNA, and Roslin scientists recently used the technique to   create gene-edited pigs that can resist disease, the Sunday Times reported. They are now working with Scott Fahrenkrug, professor of genetics at the   University of Minnesota, who is using similar techniques to create hornless   Holstein cattle. Fahrenkrug has taken a short strip of DNA from the genome of Red Angus cattle,   where it is known to suppress horn growth, and inserted it into cells taken   from an elite Holstein bull named Randy. He said: 'We have already made millions of modified cells. Next we will   use cloning technology to turn some of those cells into 40 embryos and   implant them into a herd of surrogate mothers, in the Midwest of America,   within weeks.'Each of the resulting animals will be a clone of Randy, but without his horns,   and their offspring should also be hornless. This would create the potential for horns to disappear from the whole breed in   a single generation, and could be the fastest and most dramatic change in   the appearance of cattle yet achieved by science. Britain has 1.8 million dairy cattle, 95 per cent of them Holsteins, and   decades of breeding mean one dairy cow can produce up to 10,000 litres of   milk a year — about 10 times the natural yield. In beef cattle such as Aberdeen Angus, farmers have bred out the ability to   grow horns, but this has proved impossible without damaging milk yields in   Holsteins and other dairy breeds. Bruce Whitelaw, professor of animal biotechnology at Roslin, whose gene-edited   Pig 26 is designed to resist African swine fever, said modern techniques had   become far subtler. 'We can analyse an animal's genome, find the gene behind a given trait   and then edit it to change that trait while leaving all else intact,” he   said. The technology will challenge Britain's resistance to transgenic livestock and   crops, with the welfare benefits of de-horned cattle or disease-resistant   pigs possibly transforming the debate. "
telegraph,1/1/2015 19:00,news,"Scientists at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in the US found that the majority of cancers are not linked to environment or lifestyle The majority of cancers are the result of bad luck rather than unhealthy   lifestyles or inherited genetic faults, scientists have discovered. For years health experts have warned that tumours are driven by a bad diet,   lack of exercise, or gene errors passed down from parents. The government even set up its ‘100,000 Genomes Project’ to try and find the   genetic causes of many rare diseases and cancers. But now a study has shown that most cancers are primarily caused by bad luck   rather than poor lifestyle choices or defective DNA. Researchers found that more than two thirds of cancers are driven by random   mistakes in cell division which are completely outside of our control. They found that the more cells need to divide to stay healthy, the more likely   cancer is to develop. It is the first time that scientists have been able to explain why some   cancers are more common than others. It explains why, for example, colon cancer is more prevalent than cancer of   the small intestine, because cells in the colon divide twice as fast as   those in the upper bowel. Of 31 cancers studied by scientists at Johns Hopkins University School of   Medicine in the US, just nine were found to be linked to lifestyle or   genetic faults. The remaining 22 were mainly just the result of ‘bad luck,’   with DNA and behaviour only having a small impact. The scientists claim that because it is impossible to prevent most types of   cancer through behavioural changes or genetic screening, more should be done   to speed up diagnosis so they can be spotted as early as possible. 'If two-thirds of cancer incidence across tissues is explained by random   DNA mutations that occur when stem cells divide, then changing our lifestyle   and habits will be a huge help in preventing certain cancers, but may not be   as effective for a variety of others,” said Dr Cristian Tomasetti. 'We should focus more resources on finding ways to detect such cancers at   early, curable stages.' tmgAds.embedPlayer = tmgAds.embedPlayer  {};tmgAds.embedPlayer = {width:460,height:258,size:'460x258',vidSize:'620x415'};if(typeof(tmgAds.page.platform) != 'undefined' && tmgAds.page.platform === 'mobile') tmgAds.embedPlayer = {width:300,height:169,size:'300x169',vidSize:'300x235'};tmgAds.embedPlayer = {  'targetId'     : 'embedPlayerWrapper',  'platform'     : tmgAds.page.platform,  'width'        : tmgAds.embedPlayer.width,  'height'       : tmgAds.embedPlayer.height,  'size'         : tmgAds.embedPlayer.size,  'autoplay'     : 'false',  'vidEmbed'     : 'd2djFscjqCq81AvYs6yt6HOAVvG6PXaO',  'adTag'        : tmgAdsBuildAdTag('vid',tmgAds.embedPlayer.vidSize,'pfadx',';vidsrc=tmg;vt=embed;dcmt=text/xml',3)}tmgAds.embedPlayer.remotesrc = 'http://s.telegraph.co.uk/tmgads/tools/ooyala/iframeplayer.html?platform='+tmgAds.page.platform+'&width='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.width+'&height='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.height+'&size='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.size+'&vidEmbed='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.vidEmbed+'&adTag='+encodeURIComponent(tmgAds.embedPlayer.adTag);tmgAds.embedPlayer.tmgEmbedPlayer = '<iframe src=''+tmgAds.embedPlayer.remotesrc+'' width=''+tmgAds.embedPlayer.width+'' height=''+tmgAds.embedPlayer.height+'' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0' scrolling='no' frameborder='0'></iframe>';document.write(tmgAds.embedPlayer.tmgEmbedPlayer);Cell division is important to renew the body and repair damage. But sometimes   one chemical letter in DNA is incorrectly swapped for another during the   replication process which drives the production of cancerous cells. Scientists looked at the number of cell divisions of 31 types of bodily tissue   and compared them with the overall incidence of cancer in the population of   America. They found that the more cell mutations occurred, the higher the rate of   cancer, suggesting that it was the number of random errors in replication   that was driving tumours rather than outside environmental forces. For example the cells of the pancreas regenerate far more quickly than those   of the pelvis, which is why pancreatic cancer is far more common than pelvic   cancer. However some cancers such as lung and skin cancer had higher rates than their   mutations should predict, suggesting that genetics or lifestyle factors had   increased the risk. Lead researcher Professor Bert Vogelstein, said: 'Cancer-free longevity   in people exposed to cancer-causing agents, such as tobacco, is often   attributed to their 'good genes,' but the truth is that most of them simply   had good luck. “Our study shows, in general, that a change in the number of stem cell   divisions in a tissue type is highly correlated with a change in the   incidence of cancer in that same tissue. 'We found that the types of cancer that had higher risk than predicted by   the number of stem cell divisions were precisely the ones you'd expect,   including lung cancer, which is linked to smoking; skin cancer, linked to   sun exposure; and forms of cancers associated with hereditary syndromes.' However health experts said the study demonstrates how important it is to help   lower the risk of certain cancers by eating healthily, exercising and giving   up smoking. “While some genetic mistakes are due to bad luck, we know that our cancer risk   depends on a combination of our genes, our environment and other aspects of   our lives, many of which we can control,” said Dr Emma Smith, senior science   information officer at Cancer Research UK. “We estimate that more than four in 10 cancers could be prevented by lifestyle   changes, like not smoking, keeping a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet   and cutting back on alcohol. “Making these changes is not a guarantee against cancer, but it stacks the   odds in our favour. “It's vital that we continue making progress to detect cancer earlier and   improve treatments.” Prof Hans Clevers, a stem cell and cancer biologist at the Hubrecht Institute   in Utrecht, the Netherlands, said the research would help cancer patients to   realise that the disease was not their fault. “The average cancer patient is just unlucky,” said Prof Clevers The research was published in the Journal Science.

dailymail,17/06/2015 13:44,wires,"Scientists have developed a new tissue engineering technology - overcoming one of the 'major hurdles' for growing large organs.Research led by the universities of Bristol and Liverpool found that cells can be combined with an oxygen-carrying protein to produce living tissue in the laboratory.It is hoped this can then be implanted into patients as a way of replacing diseased parts of the body.The technology has generally been limited to growing small pieces of tissue until now. This is because larger dimensions reduce the oxygen supply to cells in the centre.In the breakthrough, scientists used cartilage tissue engineering as a model system for testing a new method of overcoming the oxygen problem.The team made a new class of artificial membrane binding proteins that can be attached to stem cells.An oxygen-carrying protein, myoglobin, was attached to the stem cells before they were used to engineer cartilage.This meant each cell had its own oxygen reservoir that it could access when oxygen in the scaffold drops to dangerously low levels.Dr Adam Perriman, from Bristol's School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, said: 'From our preliminary experiments, we found that we could produce these artificial membrane binding proteins and paint the cells without affecting their biological function.'However, we were surprised and delighted to discover that we could deliver the necessary quantity to the cells to supplement their oxygen requirements.'It's like supplying each cell with its own scuba tank, which it can use to breathe from when there is not enough oxygen in the local environment.'The findings, published in Nature Communications, could expand the possibilities in tissue engineering including in cardiac muscle or bone.Researchers developed the method while using cartilage to grow tissue to repair large knee injuries.However, oxygen could not reach cells in the centre of the tissue - leaving a hole in the middle of the structure.Attaching myoglobin, which is commonly found in muscles, meant the stem cells were fully oxygenated during early stages of the growing process.This breakthrough solved the problem of the hole and is likely to pave the way for the development of a wide range of new biotechnologies.Professor Anthony Hollander, from the University of Liverpool, added: 'We have already shown that stem cells can help create parts of the body that can be successfully transplanted into patients, but we have now found a way of making their success even better.'Growing large organs remains a huge challenge but with this technology we have overcome one of the major hurdles.'Creating larger pieces of cartilage gives us a possible way of repairing some of the worst damage to human joint tissue, such as the debilitating changes seen in hip or knee osteoarthritis or the severe injuries caused by major trauma, for example in road traffic accidents or war injuries.'Artificial membrane-binding proteins stimulate oxygenation of stem cells during engineering of large cartilage tissue is published in Nature Communications."
telegraph,26/08/2012 08:45,news,"Scientists in China have created genetically modified cattle designed to produce tastier beef. For chefs and food-lovers, the perfect steak has long been the holy grail. Now scientists in China have joined the search, by creating genetically   modified cattle which they say are designed to produce tastier beef. Jing Qin 1 and 2 are clones given an extra gene which has been found to   increase the amount of fat in their muscles. When they are slaughtered, this will mean richly marbled cuts of beef – as   tender, the scientists hope, as Japan's famous wagyu beef. The two calves are the first successful products of three years of research,   but will have to reach maturity and be slaughtered to assess how successful   the experiment is. Professor Ni Hemin, who led the research at Beijing University of   Agriculture's department of advanced science and technology, said it was 'a   crucial step'. 'Through this project we will be the first in the world to successfully   create transgenic cows with fatty acid binding protein,' he said. 'Unlike pork where leaner is better, a good amount of muscle fat content   is one of the key elements when it comes to characterising beef quality. 'After more research it may be possible to achieve ideal marbling of meat   in domestic cattle and provide an alternative to imported high-grade meat.' It is the latest of a number of attempts to improve the meat and milk from   livestock by genetically modifying the animals. Earlier this year Chinese scientists revealed they had created cows whose milk   could be drunk by people suffering from lactose intolerance and contained   high levels of 'healthy' fat found normally in fish. Last year it also emerged that scientists from China had successfully   introduced human genes into 200 dairy cows to produce milk with similar   properties to human breast milk. The latest work will add to debate over the ethics and safety of attempts to   genetically modified livestock, with critics of the technology raising fears   about the welfare of the animals involved and the possibility of the meat   and milk they produce causing harm to humans. Jing Qin 1 and 2 are a local Chinese breed of cattle called Qinchuan, but have   had a gene which encourages the creation of what is called the adiposcyte   fatty acid binding protein – the protein which creates a high number of thin   streaks of fat between muscles. The fat, which becomes marbling after the animals have been slaughtered, makes   meat tender and creates its flavour. John Torode, the MasterChef judge and author a book called 'Beef',   said marbling is the key difference between a steak with flavour and one   without/ 'The strands of fat within the muscle work like a network and when cooked   this fat melts. The melting fat soaks into the fibres of the muscles making   it more tender and moist,' he said. 'If you have a muscle that is long and lean, with little fat, it will   just be tough once cooked. Having that internal network of fat deposits in   the muscle makes all the difference then between dry, stringy meat and   sumptuous, tender meat.' Wagyu beef has become famous around the world for its tenderness, and is the   most expensive beef available. It is often known as Kobe beef because of its   production in the area of Japan, but is now bred in Britain for sale in   British restaurants. Allowing genetically modified cattle would cut the cost of richly marbled   beef. Tests on the two calves have shown that they both carry the gene but it will   be some months before further tests can be conducted to find out if their   muscles are becoming enriched with fat. The scientists say it could be several years before the new meat could be   available in shops if it is approved by the authorities. During the research, however, a number of animals miscarried during pregnancy   while one GM calf died shortly after birth. Professor Ni said that they needed to carry out further research to ensure the   gene is stable in successive generations of cattle and they also want to try   the gene in other varieties of beef cattle to see if how the meat differs. He said: 'We will be focusing on improving breeding rate to increase the   population of our transgenic cows. Secondly, finding the most efficient and   scientific way for feeding and testing cow's muscle fat and proteins levels   to determine if they are best for breeding purpose. 'Finally, some more experiments need to be carried out, such as hybridising   our cows with regular cows to see if the trans-gene can be passed onto the   future generations.' The research has, however, raised concerns from animal rights campaign groups   and critics of GM technology. Dr Helen Wallace, director of campaign group Genewatch, said: 'Most   European consumers will be extremely concerned about the level of animal   suffering involved in these GM experiments. 'Traditional breeding and other techniques can be used to improve meat   quality. It is not necessary to use these technologies to make high value   products.' "

'Destroying human embryos is equivalent to an abortion. It is the same thing,' said Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo, head of the Pontifical Council for the Family.          'Excommunication will be applied to the women, doctors and researchers who eliminate embryos [and to the] politicians that approve the law,' he said in an interview with Famiglia Christiana, an official Vatican magazine.          Excommunication forbids Catholics from receiving communion, assisting in any Church duties, and sometimes from having a Church burial.          But the threat was shrugged off yesterday by Italy's leading expert on cloning, Prof Cesare Galli, of the Laboratory of Reproductive Technologies in Cremona, who was the first scientist to clone a horse.          Prof Galli likened the Vatican to the Taliban and added: 'I can bear excommunication. I was raised as a Catholic, I share Catholic values, but I am able to make my own judgment on some issues and I do not need to be told by the Church what to do or to think.          'I will be, together with Elena Cattaneo [a scientist working in the University of Milan] the first to be affected by the excommunication and then there are two other labs that I know using imported embryonic stem cells.'          The research is opposed by the Catholic Church because it involves destroying embryos. This occurs at the point when they consist of about 100 to 200 cells and the so-called inner cell mass is removed. These stem cells can grow indefinitely and turn into any of the body's 200 cell types.          Scientists believe research making use of the cells could eventually yield treatments for a range of diseases, including diabetes, heart disease and Parkinson's.          The Vatican's tough stance on the issue came as the Pope prepared to visit Valencia for the fifth annual world conference on the Catholic family. Spain passed a law permitting embryonic stem cell research two years ago to the dismay of the Church.          An Italian senator, Paola Binetti, a member of Opus Dei and a prominent campaigner for Catholic rights, also spoke against the Church's line.          'I am upset and stunned,' she said. 'It is a mistake to give out the idea that God is angry with Man because he is not in agreement with him.'

telegraph,19/05/2008 19:33,news,"Scientists will be allowed to create hybrid human-animal embryos after MPs overwhelmingly voted in favour of radical stem cell research.During passionate exchanges in the House of Commons, critics of the   controversial embryo research proposals warned that Britain was 'crossing   a Rubicon' and risked becoming a 'rogue state'. But they were heavily outnumbered by those who argued forcefully in favour of   the potential for stem cell research using hybrids which scientists believe   may transform the lives of millions and eventually stamp out some diseases   altogether. Under the new laws, British scientists will get the right to conduct the most   far reaching research into hybrid embryos in the world.. Scientists had complained of being hampered by a lack of human eggs available   for research. As a result of the measures to be introduced in the Human Fertilisation and   Embryology Bill, they will be able to boost stocks by creating embryos using   animal matter, mainly from cows and rabbits. The move was opposed by religious leaders, including the leader of the   Catholic Church in Scotland, Cardinal Keith O’Brien, who claimed such   experiments amounted to 'Frankenstein' science, and breached the   sanctity of human life. But health charities and scientists had carried out a successful lobbying   campaign of MPs, sending letters from the relatives of those suffering from   diseases ranging from motor neurone disease to Alzheimer’s. Gordon Brown and David Cameron, who both have young sons with severe medical   conditions, put on a rare show of unity to back the creation of the hybrids,   known as 'admixed embryos’. During three hours of debate, cross-party alliances were formed as MPs   discussed some of the most pressing issues of conscience for a political   generation. An attempt by critics of embryo research, led by the senior Conservative   Edward Leigh, to ban the technique was defeated by 336 votes to 176, as many   Tory MPs on the front and backbenches sided with the Government plans. A number of Labour MPs, among them many Catholics, lined up alongside the   majority of Conservatives seeking to block the move. An alternative attempt to bar 'pure hybrids,' which could be as much   as 50 per cent animal matter, was also rejected, by a narrower margin of 286   to 223. Arguing for an all-out ban on hybrid embryos, Mr Leigh told the House: 'This   does cross the ultimate boundaries between humans and animals.  'There is nobody in this House who denies with these diseases how   wonderful it would be if there was some easy way we could cure them.  'Some things are so unnecessarily dangerous that they should be banned.  'No other country is going down this route. In these terms in embryology   we would almost be like a rogue state.  'We’re like children playing with landmines without any concept on the   danger of the technology that we are handling.  'We can not and should not be spliced together with the animal kingdom.’'But the former Home Office minister, Fiona Mactaggart, urged MPs to support   the extension of embryo research, telling the House that she herself   suffered from multiple sclerosis and had been through the painful ordeal of   fertility treatment. She said: 'We have an opportunity tonight to - in the future, perhaps not   in the short term - make a real difference to chronic diseases. 'It would be a great pity if this House didn’t grasp that opportunity.'Labour’s Dr Ian Gibson, a member of the Stem Cell Foundation, urged MPs not to   limit scientific advances by over-regulating. He said: 'The reason we do science is we have a hunch, an idea. We want   to make sure that we can take science on.'But the respected former Labour minister Sir Gerald Kaufman demanded: 'How   far do you go? Where do you stop? What are the limits and what are the   boundaries?  'If you permit the creation of hybrid embryos now what will you seek to   permit next time, even if you have no idea where it will lead.'The health minister, Dawn Primarolo, countered: 'It is not a promise that   it will definitely lead to these treatments, it is an aspiration that it   might.'Ahead of the vote, Mr Cameron explained the grounds for his own support for   the use of admixed embryos, saying: 'My own approach to this is the law   needs updating and the importance of science and research and getting to   grips with genetic disease ... I want to see the research go forward.'Mr Brown had earlier described the extension of embryo research as a 'moral   endeavour', which might ultimately transform the lives of millions. MPs went on to debate plans to allow the creation of saviour siblings, where   parents use fertility treatment to select an embryo which is a genetic match   to a sick older child. On Tuesday night, the House votes on the most controversial aspects of the   Bill, when pro-life MPs will table amendments seeking to lower the legal   abortion limit from its current 24-week limit. Mr Cameron and most of the Conservative Party will oppose Government attempts   to scrap the 'need for a father' requirement for lesbian couples   and single women seeking fertility treatment. Following the free vote, which was conducted on conscience rather than party   lines, the All-Party Parliamentary Pro-Life Group, which spearheaded the   opposition to hybrid embryos, vowed to fight on throughout the Bill's   remaining stages.The group's spokesman, Labour MP Ian Lucas, said: 'To discuss the complex   issues surrounding human-animal mixed embryos in three hours is offensively   short. It gives MPs no time to explore the true implications.”The majority of the shadow cabinet - including shadow foreign secretary   William Hague and shadow home secretary David Davis - also backed the ban.MPs also voted against an amendment to ban the creation of saviour siblings by   a majority of 179. 163 voted for the ban, and 342 voted against."

Here are the issues expainedWhat are GM crops?Genetically modified crops are plants where the DNA has been modified to   introduce a new trait such as the ability to withstand drought or insects.   Scientists 'cut and paste' a gene from another organism with these   capabilities and insert it into the genome of the plant. There is no commercial growing of GM crops in Britain, but there have been   experimental trials of GM potatoes and wheat in recent years. A recent trial   in Norwich to stop potatoes developing blight has   reported successful results. What are the risks?Many people fear that disrupting the natural DNA of a plant could effect   biochemical pathways and lead to the production of unexpected toxins which   could be harmful to health. There are also concerns that GM crops may have the same impact as an invasive   alien species, damaging ecosystems. In 1999 it was suggested that GM maize,   which had been tweaked to fight pests, was killing Monarch butterflies. Pollinating plants could also transfer modified genes to weeds, boosting their   resilience and making them difficult to control. Such 'super-weeds' were discovered in Canada where cross-pollination had   occurred between GM oilseed rape plants and grasses making them immune to   herbicides. A study in 2012 suggested that herbicide-tolerant maize caused tumours and   early death in rats but the paper has since been retracted. Opponents also claim that sheep and goats are dying in India from eating   genetically modified cotton. Are the fears justified?A review of 24 studies of the health impacts of GM found there were no   significant differences between GM and non GM crops. Many scientists believe the benefits outweigh the risks. Farmers have been   changing the genetic make up of plants through breeding since agriculture   began to improve yields and make larger and hardier specimens. The government's Chief Scientific Advisor claims that 30 years of research has   proved that GM is safe and Britain can no longer ignore the benefits. What are the benefits of GM crops? Supporters say that we could develop crops that use less water and nutrients,   are resistant to insects and produce higher yields. For western countries this could bring environmental benefits through lower   pesticide use and water abstraction. In poorer countries it could help   tackle starvation and improve the working conditions of farmers and   labourers who would suffer less from pesticide contamination. Can we buy genetically modified crops on our supermarket shelves?GM ingredients are already in food available on supermarket shelves, mostly in   cooking oils containing GM soy or oilseed rape. However these will be   labelled, according to EU law. Most supermarkets have banned GM ingredients   in their own-brand products. Most farm animals in Britain are fed GM soy and no supermarket can guarantee   that dairy or meat they stock is not from animals fed GM. Waitrose continues to require non-GM feed for poultry, eggs and lamb. In April   2013, Tesco, the Co-Op and Marks and Spencer announced they no longer   required poultry to be fed on GM-free feed, following similar decisions by   Morrisons (March 2012) and Asda (September 2010). GM Freeze has produced a list of products it has found here.   This includes GM cooking oil which is used in some chip shops and takeaways. Who regulates GM crops?Currently GM crops must be passed by the European Food Safety Authority and   then be approved by the Britain’s Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and   Processes (ACNFP) – an independent body of scientific experts. None have   ever been licenced for commercial use. Are any GM crops in the pipeline in Britain?Rothamsted Research has applied for permission to grow Camelina sativa plants   containing omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. The trial would take place at a high-security plot of land in Harpenden, in   Hertfordshire, and the ACNFP has until April 21 to decide on the project. What does the government think?The government broadly backs GM and claims it is working with Europe to   'unblock the gridlock' of regulation so that crops could be grown in   Britain. Last year the Environment Secretary Owen Patterson said that organisations   fighting against GM technology such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth   were “casting a dark shadow over attempts to feed the world”. 'It’s just disgusting that little children are allowed to go blind and die   because of a hang-up by a small number of people about this technology,” he   told The Independent. Do other countries use GM crops?Yes. GM crops are already widely used in the US, Canada, Brazil, Argentina and   India. Around 85 per cent of all corn crops in the US are now GM. "

Mice that developed the condition by being exposed to pollen were protected   against attacks after the cells obtained from bone marrow were injected into   them. Stem cells hold great promise for new treatments for many conditions as they   have the ability to grow into many different types of cells and organs. They have a great healing effect when applied to damaged areas of the body. The researchers believe the bone marrow stem cells reduce inflammation in the   airways, the immune system's normal response to severe cases of asthma. These particular stem cells are already used to suppress inflammatory response   after bone marrow transplants in humans. So Dr Eva Mezey, of the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, and   colleagues injected the asthmatic mice with the cells and found they stopped   symptoms. Asthma affects more than 300 million people worldwide and although   asthma-related deaths are currently uncommon they are increasing. The researchers whose findings are published in Proceedings of the National   Academy of Sciences say about 5,000 people a year die from asthma in the US   alone with 100,000 fatalities throughout the world. Treatments for severe cases are largely inadequate at resolving the sufferer's   conditions so new ones are needed for therapy-resistant ones. They say the stem cells are already used to treat autoimmune diseases and the   same approach could provide help treat asthma and other severe allergic   conditions. Lead researcher Dr Mezey and colleagues said: 'These data suggest that   allergic conditions — specifically therapy resistant asthma — might also be   a likely target of the recently discovered cellular therapy approach using   BMSCs. 'These data provide another example of the ability of BMSCs to 'sense'   their immunological environment and respond accordingly. 'It is hard to imagine a drug or combination of drugs that could act this   way and further work should be done to determine whether the cells could be   used to treat patients with therapy-resistant asthma.'"
telegraph,7/7/2011 19:10,news,"Surgeons have carried out the world's first transplant of a fully synthetic organ, a windpipe created using the patient's own stem cells and a fully artificial scaffold. The operation was performed on a 36-year-old cancer patient a month ago at the   Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. In March last year a 10-year-old British boy received a windpipe that had been   impregnated with his own stem cells, which meant he did not have to take   powerful immuno-suppressant drugs. However, it used a trachea, or windpipe,   originally taken from a 30-year-old woman. This new technique does not need a donor: it was created from scratch with the   help of technology from University College London. Scientists there were given three-dimensional CT scans of the windpipe of   patient Andemariam Teklesenbet Beyene, a geology student from Eritrea who is   currently studying for his PhD in Iceland. From the scans, Prof Alex Seifalian and colleagues created a glass mould of Mr   Beyene's windpipe and his two main bronchial tubes. The Y-shaped structure was then coated in a special polymer containing   millions of tiny holes. It was then flown to Sweden where it was 'seeded' with stem cells   from Mr Beyene's bone marrow, under the eye of the Spanish surgeon, Prof   Paolo Macchiarini. This was placed in a bioreactor for two days to allow the stem cells to take   root. Cells to line the replacement windpipe were also used, taken from the   patient's nose. It took Prof Macchiarini 12 hours to perform the operation, first removing the   tumour and the diseased windpipe and then installing the replacement. He has previously undertaken 10 windpipe operations, including the first of a   tissue-engineered trachea, on a 30-year-old Spanish woman called Claudia   Costillo in 2008. However, this is the first not to require a donor organ. Prof Paolo Macchiarini said: 'Thanks to nanotechnology, this new branch   of regenerative medicine, we are now able to produce a custom-made windpipe   within two days or one week. 'This is a synthetic windpipe. The beauty of this is you can have it   immediately. There is no delay. This technique does not rely on a human   donation.'Professor Seifalian described it as 'an important milestone for   regenerative medicine'. He said: 'Professor Macchiarini has previously performed successful   transplants of tissue engineered tracheas, but on those occasions the   tracheas used were taken from organ donors and then reseeded with the   patient’s own stem cells. 'What makes this procedure different is it’s the first time that a wholly   tissue engineered synthetic windpipe has been made and successfully   transplanted, making it an important milestone for regenerative medicine. 'We expect there to be many more exciting applications for the novel   polymers we have developed.'Mr Beyene needed a new windpipe because he had an inoperable, cancerous tumour   the size of a golf ball that was obstructing his breathing. A month after the operation, he is doing well. He is now hoping to get home to   visit his wife and family and meet his three-month old child, whom he has   never seen. "

telegraph,30/11/2004 00:01,technology,"Taking care of a chronically-ill child can add a decade or more to the biological age of a mother's cells, according to a study of the effects of prolonged stress on the body.          A range of scientific evidence suggests that long-term psychological stress is harmful, but the exact mechanisms by which stress takes its toll have remained elusive.          Now, scientists report that stress affects telomeres, caps at the end of chromosomes that are thought to play a key role in cellular ageing and, possibly, disease.          They observed the equivalent of around 10 additional years of ageing in the cells of chronically stressed women, suggesting that these cells might have poorer function and could die sooner.          In the study, published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the University of California, San Francisco-led team determined that chronic stress, and the perception of stress, each had a significant impact on three biological factors in the blood of 58 healthy pre-menopausal women, 19 of whom had a healthy child and 39 of whom had a chronically ill child.          The duration of care-giving - after controlling for age - proved critical. The more years of care-giving, the shorter the length of the telomeres.          The team also found a decline in the activity of telomerase, an enzyme that replenishes telomeres and protects them. And there was a rise in levels of oxidative stress, which causes DNA damage and has been shown to hasten the shortening of telomeres in cell culture.          The most stunning result, said the team, was that the telomeres of women with the highest perceived psychological stress - across both groups - had undergone the equivalent of between nine and 17 years of additional cellular ageing, compared with the women across both groups who had the lowest perception of being stressed.          The group with highest stress also had significantly decreased telomerase activity and higher oxidative stress than the lowest-stress group."
telegraph,4/7/2004 0:01,news,"Terminally ill cancer patients from Europe and America are travelling to China for treatment with a revolutionary anti-tumour drug - the world's first officially licensed 'gene therapy'.          The Chinese government approved the manufacture and use of the drug at the end of last year after clinical trials found that it markedly improved the survival rate for patients with cancer of the head and neck. Doctors are now extending the treatment, named Gendicine, to patients with lung and stomach cancer.          Injected directly into the tumour, Gendicine works by, in effect, programming cancer cells to commit suicide. About 400 patients - 20 of them from abroad - have been treated with the drug in eight-week courses which cost the equivalent of £1,800.          Peng Zhaohui, a medical scientist who helped develop Gendicine, said: 'I believe this revolutionary form of gene therapy represents the future for treating cancer patients.          'There is still a lot of work to be done, but the results have been very promising so far and - unlike experimental forms of gene therapy attempted elsewhere - there is no evidence of serious side-effects. We have treated foreign patients successfully and word is beginning to spread.'          Mr Peng has been inundated with requests from overseas, including Britain, from patients desperate to try Gendicine. Arthur Winiarski, 48, a Polish-American businessman based in Warsaw, who was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma in his sinuses after a routine medical check-up 18 months ago, was one of them.          After operations, radiotherapy and chemotherapy in Poland, America and Germany, he was told by doctors at a hospital in Berlin that he had almost no hope. 'They wanted to get rid of me. The only thing they could suggest was chemotherapy but they and I both knew this does not work with this kind of cancer,' he said.          Then a friend saw a sentence about the new drug on the internet, which mentioned Mr Peng. Mr Winiarski emailed a short history of his case to the scientist. To his astonishment, within three hours came a reply: 'I think I will be able to help you.'          Still sceptical about his prospects, Mr Winiarski travelled to China and presented himself to Dr Niu Qi, an oncologist at Beijing's elite Tongren hospital, in April. He was told he needed surgery as well as the drug treatment.          He said: 'They inject the drug into the tumour and it goes bananas: it invades itself and commits suicide. My tumour was so big - the size of a fist - that they had to use the drug to shrink it first.'          After further doses of Gendicine Mr Winiarski was given the all-clear. He said: 'To have a life like mine, to be a successful businessman, with everything going well and then all of sudden be told you have months to live - you cannot understand. This experience has been incredible and you could not believe the care I have had. I came here in desperation and they have treated me like a king.'          Gendicine works by inserting a gene, called p53, into a virus, which is then injected into patients. The gene is naturally present in healthy cells but is 'switched off' or mutated in many cancer patients. When reinserted into tumour cells by the virus, it triggers their self-destruction.          Mr Peng's company SiBiono, in Shenzhen, southern China, first tested Gendicine on head and neck squamous cancers which are relatively common in China.          In a clinical trial 120 patients were treated, some with the drug combined with radiotherapy, others with radiotherapy alone. All were then monitored for more than a year.          There was complete regression of the tumours in 64 per cent of those given the drug, three times the rate of those given radiotherapy alone. The only recorded side-effect was a mild fever.          Mr Peng said: 'I don't think that there are likely to be any long-term effects because Gendicine cannot replicate in the patients' cells.'          China's State Food and Drug Administration approved use of the drug in October and SiBiono was granted permission to begin manufacturing it in February. Prof French Anderson, director of Gene Therapy Laboratories at the University of Southern California, who is widely regarded as the father of gene therapy, has given the production plant his approval. He said: 'It is an impressive manufacturing facility.'          Prof Anderson said that the adenovirus being used by the Chinese to deliver the p53 gene to cells had largely been abandoned by Western scientists. He said, however: 'Sometimes simpler is best.'          Mr Winiarski's oncologist, Dr Niu, who trained at Harvard, said that his patient would need to return to China for further checks, but added: 'So far this has been very good and I would be happy to use it with other patients.'          Dr Niu said: 'I plan to use it for liver cancer and gastric cancer because p53 is widely mutated in other forms of cancer, not just head and neck. My colleagues are excited by this and want to try it.'          Mr Peng said: 'This is no overnight success. It has taken 15 years of development and several years of clinical trials before we have reached this stage.          'There is still work to be done but we are proud of what we have achieved.'          SiBiono has held 'preliminary discussions' with Western pharmaceutical companies about possible manufacture and sale of the drug abroad, where testing requirements are far stricter."

The Democrat-controlled house passed the vote with a majority of 63 to 24 - just short of the two-thirds required to override a presidential veto.         Mr Bush vetoed a similar draft bill last year that would have substantially increased the federal funding of such research because he believed it would 'support the taking of innocent human life'.             Yesterday he said that the Senate bill 'crosses a moral line that I and many others find troubling'. He added that he would use his powers to veto the Senate's bill if it advanced through to Congress.            Stem cells are immature cells, created shortly after conception, which have the capacity to turn into any kind of tissue in the body.         Supporters believe that research on stem cells could help to cure diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease.                They insisted that the bill would allow research only on cells created in fertility clinics which would otherwise be thrown away.            However, Conservative Republicans have likened the destruction of frozen human embryos to abortion.            The issue of stem cell research has left the President's Republican Party divided.   Last year, both houses of the Republican-controlled Congress passed the Bill which Mr Bush vetoed, and some of the most emotional appeals for its passage were made by one of the Right's heroines, Nancy Reagan.           Her husband, President Ronald Reagan, died of Alzheimer's disease, one of the illnesses that stem cell research could help to cure.           The use of the veto, a presidential prerogative, was the first by Mr Bush during his five years in office. He has used the veto less than any president since Thomas Jefferson 200 years ago."

They shall not pass                                       (: 09/07/04)                     Outspoken biotech boss is not afraid to criticise violent activists or the Home Secretary, writes Rosie Murray-West                  If you're wanting an iron fist in an immaculately tailored glove, look no further than Aisling Burnand. The chief executive of the BioIndustry Association has had to be tough.          At 39, and with no scientific background, this well-groomed blonde has become the voice of one of Britain's most controversial industries, and she's not afraid to criticise anyone who stands in its way. Home Secretary David Blunkett felt the full force of her ire late last month, when it emerged that he supported a leading anti-vivisection charity. She stopped short of calling for his resignation - but only just.          It's no wonder she was angry. Together with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical research companies her trade association represents, she has had to deal with the unacceptable face of animal rights for many years. Not every woman with two young children has to discuss with their nanny what might happen if an activist drops a firebomb through their letterbox, but for her it's a very real possibility.          'It's something I have to consider in terms of their safety.' she says. 'I have sat down and talked to my husband, my wider family and the children's nanny about it. I have to make sure from a security perspective that I am doing as many things as I can do, but if someone wants to find you, they will find you.'          The BIA includes among its 350 members Huntingdon Life Sciences, whose managing director Brian Cass was attacked with a baseball bat for testing drugs and chemicals on animals. 'I think he's a great leader, and the whole team do a great job in difficult conditions,' she says. 'It makes me angry that children and women and men in their homes are being threatened, firebombed or having hoax bomb threats sent.'          The scientific research organisation that Blunkett is supporting is scarcely on a level with SHAC, the animal rights group believed to be responsible for Mr Cass's injuries. However, it's easy to see why the industry feels betrayed by the Home Secretary's allegiance, especially since he is meant to be responsible for putting in laws to protect them.         Two weeks after Mr Blunkett was outed as an anti-vivisectionist, even Ms Burnand herself seems slightly embarrassed by her outburst in the  Telegraph, where she said 'David Blunkett should examine his conscience as to whether he should remain Home Secretary if he is compromised in this area'.          'I really don't want to comment on last week's news,' she says, twisting her hands in front of her. 'A week's a long time in politics. Things move on, and things happen.' Sources close to the Government whisper that even some in the industry thought she had gone a bit far, but there's certainly no question that's she's retracting anything she said.          It's the only time in our interview that she looks anything other than radiantly confident. One of the few business leaders to have risen from the position of press officer to running the organisation she used to promote, she's accustomed to dealing with the media, and describes herself as a 'communication person'.          'I like issues,' she says firmly. 'Difficult issues.' It's just as well really, since as well as the animal testing issue, representing her members involves debates on stem cells, GM food and human cloning - some of the most emotive topics of our time.          The animal rights problem in particular has dogged her for her entire career, ever since she did an HND in Communications and joined a UK division of chemical and pharmaceutical business Rhone Poulenc as a press officer. Her only scientific qualification was O-Level biology.          Even 20 years ago, it appears, there was plenty of misinformation about what animal testing entailed. 'People would be calling up and saying 'my cat's gone missing. Have you taken my cat?' ' she recalls. 'I had to tell them to talk to the police, and explain that their cat wouldn't have been any good to us anyway. It's difficult to try and explain that rationally to an old lady who has just lost her pet.'          Having looked after dogs, hamsters and a pony as a child, she's far from sanguine about the use of animals in scientific experiments, but as it is mandated by Government before a drug can be tested on humans, she believes we have no choice.         'I would definitely consider myself an animal welfare person. I believe we have got to have respect for animals. My father's a vet and he's a research scientist at the Royal Veterinary College. As a child I grew up going to the research station and so I understood that animals are needed for medical research from a very early age. I hope there'll be a day when they won't be needed, but at the moment I'm a pragmatist. There are no alternatives.'          She says this in much the same tone as I imagine she uses to tell her children to go to bed, not aggressive exactly, but brooking no argument. When I ask her how the rest of the association view her she giggles and then replies 'firm but fair, I think'.         The (mostly male) biotechnology chief executives who are her members don't dare argue with her, or at least they don't when they realise who she is. 'Often I go to meetings and chat to people and they say 'what do you do for the BIA?' and I say 'well, I run it'. And they are shocked, and I laugh, because I find the whole thing quite amusing. They have an idea in their heads about what I should be doing for the organisation, and it's not running it.'          Her own commitment to her family, two boys of two and four and her corporate lawyer husband, is such that she works from home on Fridays, and spends the rest of her time juggling work and home with varying degrees of success. 'The one single thing that has made it possible is internet shopping. Recently at Bio [a huge biotechnology conference] I was online using Ocado because the kids have got to eat.'          If she has any spare time, she spends it restoring antique furniture, a skill she learnt during a 'year off' in New York while her husband was working there, and attempting to go to the gym. 'I have good weeks and bad weeks. And on the bad ones I just have to think - well, there's always another week.'          And there's always plenty to do when you are promoting a dwindling sector that has recently seen its biggest company, Celltech, taken over by a foreign rival. Despite years of hype, there are only a handful of UK-developed biotechnology drugs currently in use, and plenty of critics would say the whole industry has disappointed its investors. Ms Burnand, however, is optimistic.          'I think the markets are somewhat to blame,' she says of the difficulties. 'It's trust, though, that the companies we have need to deliver. But it's like explorers - the first ships that set out don't always get to their destination, but the next ones will.'          Without Government protection from the animal rights extremists, however, increasing numbers of companies will choose to do their experiments abroad, which will effectively kill Britain's scientific research.         'It's vital to push for laws to protect employees. With most pressure groups the thing is to talk to them, but in this particular area, that is not the thing to do. They are just so different. All they want is to close us down. People are being targeted at home on a Sunday afternoon. It's quite frightening, and very intimidating.'          Suddenly it strikes me that, with two small boys at home, even talking to me about the issue is a brave, and perhaps foolhardy thing for her to be doing. Does she ever worry about the effect it will have on her family? She sets her mouth in a thin line.          'At the end of the day this is my job. No one is going to bully or intimidate me out of doing it.' Personally, I wouldn't dare try and stop her. Animal rights extremists, and David Blunkett, might be wise to take note."

The Most Reverend Peter Smith said he has privately advised MPs, including at least one minister, to vote against certain aspects of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill when it comes before the House of Commons later this year.          His comments  came after Cardinal Keith O'Brien, the Church's leader in Scotland, launched a fierce attack on the Government's plans and announced he will use his Easter Sunday sermon to censure the Bill.

'I have written to the Prime Minister myself asking him that, in view of these very important issues which touch on the sacredness of human life, its meaning and purpose, would he please grant a free vote, because that is what is really required.'         But Labour MP Jim Devine, himself a Catholic, urged the Bill's critics to discuss the issue with scientists involved in stem cell research.          Mr Devine, the MP for Livingston, has written to the Cardinal, calling on him to meet the scientists involved.         Mr Devine, who supports the Bill, said: 'The statements attributed to the Cardinal over the past few days highlight a lack of understanding of the process of stem cell biology.'          Health minister Ben Bradshaw last night dismissed Cardinal O'Brien's comments and said the Government was 'absolutely right' to try to push the Bill through Parliament.          'I think if it was about the things the Cardinal referred to, creating babies for spare parts or raiding dead people's tissue, then there would be justification for a free vote,' he told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions. 'But it's not about those things.                                         'This is about using pre-embryonic cells to do research that has the potential to ease the suffering of millions of people in this country. The Government has taken a view that this is a good thing.'         The Prime Minister is facing a Cabinet revolt over the issue with three ministers contemplating their positions this weekend.         Des Browne, the Defence and Scottish Secretary, Paul Murphy, the Welsh Secretary, and Ruth Kelly, the Transport Secretary, are understood to be pushing to vote against parts of the Bill.          They may be forced to resign if Mr Brown does not back down and allow a free vote on the issue.         Labour backbencher Andrew Mackinlay today said that many of his colleagues in the Commons were becoming frustrated with the Government's apparent inability to read the political situation on issues like the Embryology Bill or the demands of Gurkhas for equal rights with other soldiers.          The MP for Thurrock, in Essex, said it was clear that Mr Brown would be forced to back down on both issues and his failure to recognise this was damaging Labour.          Mr Mackinlay told the whips' office last week that he was granting himself a free vote on the Embryology Bill, regardless of Mr Brown's decision.            Catholic leaders in England and Wales have already denounced the plans but the attack by Cardinal O'Brien is the most vitriolic to date. Supporters of the legislation believe hybrid embryos could lead to cures for diseases including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's.          In tomorrow's sermon, Cardinal O'Brien will say: 'This Bill represents a monstrous attack on human rights, human dignity and human life. I can say that the Government has no mandate for these changes: they were not in any election manifesto, nor do they enjoy widespread public support.'          Cardinal O'Brien will berate Mr Brown for imposing a three-line whip on Labour MPs over the Bill and will also claim that it would lead to the endorsement of experiments of 'Frankenstein proportion'.          His attack comes just days after the Archbishop of Cardiff, the Most Rev Peter Smith, condemned the proposals as 'gross interference in human life'. The leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, has also urged Catholics to write to their MPs to demand free votes.         The Most Rev Vincent Nichols, the Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham, is planning to use his Easter Monday homily to call for a free vote.          He will urge the congregation to write to their MPs about proposals in the Bill and say the suggestion that Labour MPs with conscientious objections may abstain 'would not be good enough'.           David Cameron has said that Tory MPs will get a free vote on all aspects of the legislation and the Liberal Democrats are expected to follow suit for its most controversial elements.          Discussions between Labour MPs opposed to the Bill and Geoff Hoon, the party's Chief Whip, are understood to have resulted in a stalemate.          Mr Hoon has offered them the option of writing to him asking him to be excused from the vote on ethical grounds, but he has made it clear that they must not vote against it.          The Department of Health said the legislation has been scrutinised by parliamentary select committees and the House of Lords and been the subject of a public consultation. A spokesman said: 'This is not about 'creating monsters'. It is purely laboratory research, and is aimed at increasing knowledge about serious diseases and treatments for them.'"
telegraph,7/12/2000 0:00,news,"THE Church of England has entered the controversy over embryo research by suggesting that cloning human embryos is no more unnatural than a heart transplant.A briefing paper for the Church's Board for Social Responsibility dismisses fears that allowing scientists to create embryos as part of research into new treatments for disease would be the 'slippery slope' towards cloning human beings.It argues that such research 'may be thought to be as morally acceptable' as experiments on embryos to discover treatments for infertility, which are already allowed in the UK.While not official Church policy the paper, written by Canon Dr John Polkinghorne, chairman of the Board's Science and Medical Technology Committee and a leading scientist and theologian, will be highly influential.Canon Polkinghorne - who is also a member of the Human Genetics Commission - is a leading Church adviser and member of the General Synod. In addition, the Board, chaired by the Bishop of Oxford, the Right Reverend Richard Harries, will have approved the submission before its release.This is the first time the Church has stepped so explicitly into the controversy over the morals of so-called stem-cell research, on which MPs are due to vote. However, the Roman Catholic bishops of England and Wales said they were 'greatly concerned' by the implications of cloning human embryos.They urged Catholics to write to their MPs in advance of the free vote on new regulations in Parliament. The Catholic bishops said in a statement: 'We believe that research on cloned human embryos is both immoral and unnecessary. It is immoral because it involves the deliberate creation of new human lives for the sole purpose of extracting stem cells for research.'The bishops said: 'It strips an individual human life, in its earliest form, of all dignity, reducing it to no more than a commodity, a supply of disposable organic matter. It is also unnecessary because other avenues of stem-cell research exist which may offer the same potential benefits without the ethical difficulties.'The bishops said that they recognised the laudable motives of research to cure disease, but what was technically possible 'is not for that reason alone morally acceptable'.Scientists believe stem cells, embryonic cells with the capability of becoming a range of cell types, could be the key to new treatments for diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and diabetes, and might even be used to grow organs for transplants.The government's Chief Medical Officer, Dr Liam Donaldson, has recommended that the research be allowed to go ahead under the control of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. The law in the UK already allows research on human embryos up to 14 days old for fertility treatments. The government intends to lay regulations which will allow researchers to use embryos left over from fertility treatment in stem-cell experiments.More controversially the regulations would also allow 'therapeutic cloning', the creation of embryos with a genetic make-up identical to a living adult. This would be done by the same methods which produced Dolly the sheep, and could, in theory, produce a cloned human being. The nucleus of a human egg would be removed and replaced with a nucleus of a cell from an adult.Scientists argue therapeutic cloning is an essential part of the search for new treatments as individuals who are ill will best be helped by new organs which identically match their own. They would 'harvest' stem cells from the embryos which would not be allowed to develop further.But opponents, including the Roman Catholic Church, protest that therapeutic cloning will inevitably lead to cloned human beings because the basic scientific method, known as Cell Nuclear Replacement, is exactly the same.They also point to evidence that adult human beings have stem cells in the body which can be coaxed into different cell types and argue that the embryo research is not needed. In his paper Canon Polkinghorne says the use of this method to create a child - which the government has said it will ban - would be 'ethically' unacceptable'.Canon Polkinghorne says that therapeutic cloning 'can be readily fenced off from reproductive cloning' by prohibiting attempts to implant embryos into a woman where they could, theoretically, develop into a child. Canon Polkinghorne argues against the 'absolute' view of the Roman Catholic Church that an embryo is a full human being from the point of conception and thus any intervention other than for its own good is wrong.Canon Polkinghorne says that while this view must be given 'respectful attention, it is fair to say that it does not wholly correspond to actual practice. No one seems to suggest holding a funeral service for an embryo that failed to implant and was lost.'Canon Polkinghorne admits that research in human genetics raises anxieties about 'playing God' but he says: 'A heart transplant is as radically unnatural a procedure as CNR.' He says that Man's power to manipulate his world could be seen as 'God-given'. Canon Polkinghorne says: 'The point then is to use those powers aright and in accordance with the divine will.'Dr Evan Harris, the Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford, and an active supporter of regulated stem-cell research last night welcomed the paper's 'positive approach'. He said: 'Opponents of embryo research cannot say they have a monopoly on the religious arguments. Many of us feel that it would be morally wrong not to allow embryo research to find new treatments for terrible diseases.'    Tony Blair's plans to allow cloning are under threat from Brussels which regards the practice as 'unethical'. A key European Commission committee ruled that the research is 'premature'. The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, which reports directly to Commission President Romano Prodi, has also warned that therapeutic cloning may breach the European Union's new Charter on Fundamental Rights.

In other words, these particular parasites 'earn their keep in the genome'.Although transposons have only one aim in life: to copy themselves, the consortium points out that these selfish pieces of DNA have been responsible for important innovations in our genetic recipe.Before last week's announcements, it was known that at least 20 human genes had been created by transposons. Now the figure is 47.

telegraph,10/3/2008 0:01,news,"The controversy over legislation on embryology grew last night following proposals to allow babies to be conceived using 'artificial' sperm and eggs.                                       The Government already faces a rebellion by Roman Catholic Cabinet ministers and Labour backbenchers, dozens of whom may vote against the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill.            The legislation would allow the creation of hybrid animal-human embryos for scientific research.            Yesterday it emerged that ministers are considering supporting an amendment which would allow so-called artificial gametes - sperm and eggs - to be used to create a human pregnancy through IVF.          The technique involves taking embryonic cells from a would-be parent and growing them into sperm in a laboratory.         That would allow groups such as cancer sufferers who have been made infertile by treatment, and women who cannot produce their own eggs, to have children who are genetically related to them.         Evan Harris, the Liberal Democrat science spokesman who will table the amendment, said: 'There is no good explanation for not allowing this option for people who have survived cancer and cannot have children.'         Dawn Primarolo, the public health minister, said the technique could help alleviate the shortage of sperm donors, but she accepted there were 'profound ethical questions'.          The science is in its early stages and has so far only been used to create pregnancies in mice. It would probably be a decade before a human pregnancy could be achieved.          The campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics said the technique could lead to the 'ultimate incest' of a single person being both mother and father of the same child.         The latest development will further anger Roman Catholic Labour MPs who have already rejected a Government offer to allow them to abstain from a vote on the Bill, which is a key part of the legislative programme announced in the Queen's Speech.         It has been championed by Gordon Brown who believes it is vital in the fight to cure conditions such as motor neurone disease and cystic fibrosis.         The Bill will allow for the creation of animal-human embryos - by injecting animal cells or DNA into human embryos or human cells into animal eggs - to be used in medical research and then discarded.          It will also reform the fertility laws, meaning that clinics will not have to consider the 'need for a father' before providing IVF treatment. This means lesbian couples could be registered as legal parents.         Labour MPs will be under a three-line whip to back the legislation. The Conservatives have given their MPs a free vote on what they deem an issue of conscience.         Cabinet ministers are normally bound by collective responsibility to vote for any Government Bill but Des Browne, the Defence Secretary, Ruth Kelly, the Transport Secretary, and Paul Murphy, the Welsh Secretary have all threatened to refuse on religious grounds.          Mr Brown is expected to tell them they can abstain but if they vote against they will not remain members of the Government.         The Bill, to be voted on within the next two months, has already been delayed in order to reach a compromise.                                    What the Bill would permit                                          Chimera embryos: Scientists would be free to insert human DNA into animal cells, creating hybrid or 'chimera' embryos for medical research. Pro-life campaigners claim the process involves destruction of human life and could lead to the birth of a chimera baby.                     No father needed: Clinics offering IVF treatment would no longer be required to consider the need for a father in raising a child. Same-sex couples would be recognised as legal parents, allowing lesbian couples to have children.                     Embryo screening:  Embryos would be screened for genetic abnormalities and matches for siblings with life-threatening illnesses. Selecting an embryo based on gender would be banned.                     Information for children: Children conceived from donated sperm or eggs will be allowed, at the age of 16, to ask for information on any half-siblings. They will also be able to check whether they are related to a partner and request details about their donor parent.

To the dismay of opponents of such research, the Koreans have succeeded in the efficient creation of more than 30 cloned human embryos - regardless of the age, sex and infirmity of the person being cloned. They then dismantled the embryos to grow the first lines of patient-specific embryonic cells.          This marks the start of what many scientists believe will be a revolution in medicine.          The embryonic stem cells were created from patients with spinal cord injury, juvenile diabetes and immune deficiency. In the short term, these will lead to laboratory studies designed to help understand the basics of human development and these ailments. In the long term, they will pave the way to a range of new treatments.          The advance, announced in the journal Science today, puts the Koreans about two years ahead of Prof Alison Murdoch, Dr Miodrag Stojkovic and Dr Majlinda Lako in Newcastle. It underlines the urgency of efforts by the biotech entrepreneur Sir Chris Evans to set up a British foundation to raise hundreds of millions of pounds for research.

The British team created its clones by reprogramming eggs with embryonic cells and now plans to use adult cells taken from a diabetic.

Their new work shows an efficient way to create cloned embryos so that they can be dismantled for their stem cells - parent cells that can turn into any of the 200-plus types in the body.          Speaking at the Royal Institution in London yesterday, Prof Hwang said his work contained several 'major breakthroughs' that brought stem cell treatments 'a step forward'.          Although the team denies that the work brings cloned babies any closer - that is not the aim of the project - many of the insights described in today's paper would aid maverick scientists who wanted to do so.          'Reproductive cloning is unsafe and unethical,' Prof Hwang emphasised. He said that cloned animals had experienced a range of problems, so, 'regardless of cruel hoaxes, scientific evidence should further dispirit reckless notions regarding human reproductive cloning'.

telegraph,15/06/2012 08:45,news,"The first stroke patients to take part in pioneering stem cell treatment trials have shown signs of improvement, doctors have disclosed.Six patients had human stem cells inserted close to the damaged part of their   brain and have since witnessed improvements in the limb weakness they   suffered as a result of their stroke. In one case, a man given the treatment regained the power of speech after the   stem cells of an aborted 12-week-old baby was injected into his brain. However, doctors have cautioned against reading too much into the early   results of the clinical trial – a world first for neural stem cell therapy   for stroke victims. The trial is being conducted at the Institute of Neurological Sciences at the   Southern General Hospital in Glasgow, and is being led by Glasgow University   neurologist Professor Keith Muir. He told the BBC: 'So far we've seen no evidence of any harmful effects.   We're dealing with a group of people a long time after a stroke with   significant disability and we don't really expect these patients to show any   change over time.  'So it's interesting to see that in all the patients so far they have   improved slightly over the course of their involvement in the study.' The six patients suffered strokes between six months and five years before   they were treated, and all had been left with limb weakness. The patients were assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke   Scale which ranked the first five patients with a median score of eight   before the treatment and four points three months afterwards. The sixth patient was treated less than three months ago. Six further patients   will be treated as part of this Phase 1 trial. Professor Muir said he was 'intrigued' by the early results. He added: 'We know that if you're involved in a trial you are going to   see patients change in behaviour, particularly if you're doing something   invasive, so we need to be very cautious indeed in interpreting these   results.  'However, that said, it is not something we'd anticipated seeing in this   group of patients.' Further trials are needed to establish whether stem cells actually help the   brain repair damaged tissue. Michael Hunt, chief executive officer of the company developing the treatment,   ReNeuron, said: 'The clinical trial is primarily a safety study and we   must therefore treat any of the observed early indications of functional   benefit with considerable caution at this stage.

I wasn’t overly bothered but my father, recently retired and reinvented as an eco-warrior, was getting agitated. He dumped a pile of papers on my desk and, reluctantly at first, I got reading.  At university, ten years earlier, I had been intrigued by the neatly simple, powerful genetic coding that controlled the synthesis of proteins and hence heredity and all life. Wow: who wouldn’t be excited? The discovery won Watson, Crick and Wilkins a well-deserved Nobel Prize in 1962 and, as the tools developed to apply and exploit the discovery, a science, an industry and then a political lobby was born.  •Genetically modified crops are the future and must not be blocked, say scientists   After a month of reading I was alarmed by the potential food safety and environmental implications of the emerging technology, and with encouragement from the Soil Association and Friends of the Earth, I challenged the legality of the maize trials and the case went all the way to the High Court; but the real battle turned out to be in the media.   Guy Watson owns Riverford Organic (CHRISTOPER JONES)  Despite being a vocal campaigner I was never fundamentally opposed to the technology, rather the rush to commercialise it at any cost. With cries of 'Frankenstein food' from the anti-GM movement and spurious claims of solving world hunger from the pro lobby, the smokescreen of misleading, emotive information from both sides has made it almost impossible to form a non-partisan, informed opinion. I got fed up, declined invitations to speak and backed out of the fight. Money talks in PR, if only because it can buy the persistence that few causes can maintain, and over the last 15 years the GM industry has won the battle, in England and Wales at least. Is this down to the strength of their arguments or the depth of their pockets? Either way, the culmination was seen last week with the BBC’s blatantly pro-GM edition of Panorama, entitled ‘Cultivating Fear’.  •Genetically modified crops: Q&A  What most took me aback was how the programme justified the use of GM aubergine in Bangladesh as a means of preventing pesticide poisoning among farming families. The scale of the poisoning was truly horrific and is repeated across the developing world where many farmers are illiterate and use pesticides with no protective clothing. One of the most disturbing things I have ever seen is a Ugandan farmer smoking a soggy cigarette while spraying tomatoes; it was soggy with the toxic liquid leaking from his back pack sprayer. In the Punjab, according to doctors quoted in the excellent film The True Cost, it is common for villages to have 70 or more children suffering from birth defects, cancers and mental illness resulting from pesticide exposure.  As such, I found it almost surreal to hear these horrific consequences of the last round of agritech progress being used as a justification for the next, especially when the products in question are supplied by the same western companies. This was PR spin at its worst, yet I wondered if I had become a hopelessly romantic Luddite, part of former Secretary of State Owen Paterson’s “green blob” resisting progress from a position of privilege. I needed the facts, so 15 years on from that courtroom battle I sat down again to read.   Anti-GM demonstrators (REX FEATURES)  This is what I found out: GM crops have not reduced pesticide use - according to the US Department of Agriculture (normally pro GM), over 15 years GM crops have resulted in a 7 per cent increase in pesticide use due to weeds and insects developing resistance.  Even the Bangladesh GM aubergine is far from an unbridled success - according to a local scientist, many of the farmers who took part in the experiment have suffered crop loss and debt as a result.  Furthermore, the USDA states there is no evidence of GM increasing yield potential. It turns out conventional breeding has been much better at boosting yields at a fraction of the cost.  •Genetically modified crops could be planted in England this year   None of the claims for nutritionally enhanced food, drought-tolerant or more nitrogen-efficient crops have been successful to date. Owen Paterson labelled the anti-GM lobby “wicked” for resisting vitamin A enhanced GM ‘golden rice’. The reality is that it has proved difficult to make the technology work and the developers at the International Rice Research Institute say they are years from being ready to grow a successful commercial crop. How and why could a politician with research assistants make such a provocative and poorly informed statement?  After 18 years of Americans eating GM food it is claimed that there are no obvious health impacts, but the same was said after much longer periods for smoking, trans fats, asbestos, excessive salt etc. There have been peer reviewed animal studies which have raised concern but I find it worrying that in the case of any questioning of GM the response is always a near hysterical hounding of the scientists from their post.   An anti-GM demonstration in Hertfordshire (LEON NEAL)  These are just some of the issues that should concern all of us. For all but the most ardent laissez faire capitalist I would suggest there are two more worth considering:  In the last 20 years the biotech companies have been buying up the global seed trade; the top three (Monsanto, Dupont and Syngenta) own a staggering 47 per cent. With the loss of smaller companies go local varieties suited to local conditions and requirements. As a grower myself, I have seen a very noticeable decline in choice.  Even more extreme: 87 per cent of the global surface of GM crops is controlled by Monsanto, either directly through the sale of seeds or indirectly through the licence of traits for which they own the patents.  •GM food: saving lives, or lining corporate pockets?  I am reluctant to be branded a communist (again) but I was taught that the efficiency of capitalism required free markets and that a key part of a free market was the avoidance of monopolies. Monsanto and the other so called ‘big ag’ multinationals clearly have a vision for our future and are rapidly getting in a position to impose it; Owen Paterson and the Panorama presenter Tom Heap may be comfortable with that, but I am uneasy with a global food supply being controlled by the same people who brought us DDT, Agent Orange and PCBs.  I think it is highly likely that GM will have a role in shaping sustainable agriculture at some point; no one can predict where science can take us. But in debating how to feed the world, bombarding us with emotive and misleading messages driven more by a PR agenda than by fact is unforgivable. We need, rather, a cool headed evaluation of the scientific evidence, tempered by transparency around the commercial interests at play.  Guy Watson owns Riverford Organic Farms "

telegraph,22/04/2010 10:44,news,"The mechanism through which a worm can regenerate its own body parts after they are amputated has been discovered by scientists. The research into how Planarian worms can regrow body parts – including a   whole head and brain – could one day make it possible to regenerate old or   damaged human organs and tissues, the University of Nottingham said. The research, led by Dr Aziz Aboobaker, a Research Councils UK Fellow in the   university's School of Biology, shows a gene called ''Smed-prep'' is   essential for correctly regenerating a head and brain in Planarian worms. The worms have the unusual ability to regenerate body parts, including a head   and brain, following amputation. They contain adult stem cells that are constantly dividing and can become all   of the missing cell types. They also have the right set of genes working to make this happen as it should   so that when they regrow body parts they end up in the right place and have   the correct size, shape and orientation, the research showed. The study is published today in the open access journal PLoS Genetics. Dr Aboobaker said: ''These amazing worms offer us the opportunity to observe   tissue regeneration in a very simple animal that can regenerate itself to a   remarkable extent and does so as a matter of course. ''We want to be able to understand how adult stem cells can work collectively   in any animal to form and replace damaged or missing organs and tissues. ''Any fundamental advances in understanding from other animals can become   relevant to humans surprisingly quickly. ''If we know what is happening when tissues are regenerated under normal   circumstances, we can begin to formulate how to replace damaged and diseased   organs, tissues and cells in an organised and safe way following an injury   caused by trauma or disease. ''This would be desirable for treating Alzheimer's disease, for example. ''With this knowledge we can also assess the consequences of what happens when   stem cells go wrong during the normal processes of renewal – for example in   the blood cell system where rogue stem cells can result in Leukaemia.'' The researchers said Smed-prep is necessary for the correct differentiation   and location of cells that make up a Planarian worm's head, as well as for   defining where the head should be located. They found although the presence of Smed-prep is vital so the head and brain   are in the right place, the worm stem cells can still be persuaded to form   brain cells as a result of the action of other unrelated genes. But even so, without Smed-prep these cells do not organise themselves to form   a normal brain, the researchers said. Daniel Felix, a graduate student who carried out the experimental work, today   added: ''The understanding of the molecular basis for tissue remodelling and   regeneration is of vital importance for regenerative medicine. ''Planarians are famous for their immense power of regeneration, being able to   regenerate a new head after decapitation. ''With the homeobox gene Smed-prep, we have characterised the first gene   necessary for correct anterior fate and patterning during regeneration. ''It has been a really exciting project and I feel very lucky to have had this   study as the centre piece of my thesis work.'' "

Click to enlarge           The entire genetic code of a human consists of three billion 'letters', about 30 times larger than that of the worm and fruit fly, and about 250 times bigger than that of yeast.Earlier estimates of the number of instructions - genes - it contained ranged as high as 140,000, with some estimating it would take as many as 100,000 to build the brain alone, the most complex known object in the universe.Last week, however, it emerged that only 1.1 per cent of our code actually corresponded to genes, the instructions to make proteins for the 300 basic cell types in the body.A paper published in the journal Nature by the International Human Genome Sequencing consortium puts the total number at between 30,000 and 40,000. The Science paper, by Dr Craig Venter of Celera Genomics and 282 co-authors (including Dr Venter's nephew Eli) puts the total number at somewhere between 26,383 and 39,114.If the final tally is around 30,000, then it took only about 12,000 more genes than a worm and around 17,000 more genes than a fruit fly to build Einstein, who consisted of five times more than a mere bacterium. Dr Venter said that this was 'the single most surprising fact' to emerge from his work.'That a mere one-third increase in gene numbers could be enough to progress from a rather unsophisticated nematode to humans is certainly quite provocative and will undoubtedly trigger scientific, philosophical, ethical and religious questions,' said Dr Jean Michel Claverie of the French research organisation, CNRS-Aventis in Marseille.However, Dr Claverie commented that it was easy to show, mathematically at least, 'how a relatively small number of genes could be sufficient to generate a tremendous biological complexity'.The genome is emphatically not a blueprint. Human genes are more complex than those in a worm or fly, and they are regulated by intricate control circuits. The genes are split into multiple pieces, and our proteins consist of more basic building blocks ('domains') that can be shuffled into different combinations. With enough shuffling, we can generate up to five times as many proteins as worms and flies.As a result, commented Prof Stanley Fields of the University of Washington, Seattle, the 'proteome' is an order of magnitude more complex than the genome. Some estimate there are 90,000 distinct proteins, while Dr Venter believes the figure is 250,000.What is more, proteins respond to changes in conditions, such as pH, by moving around cells, getting sliced into pieces, and adjusting their stability, and altering what they bind to. Bits and pieces can be added to a protein to fine-tune performance. A single protein can do several different jobs, while a single job in the body can be done by several proteins.But our basic genetic recipe is not more complex than that of some man-made objects, Dr Claverie claims. Assuming each gene interacts with four or five others on average, 'the human genome is not significantly more complex than a modern jet aeroplane (which contains more than 200,000 unique parts, each of them interacting with three or four others on average)'.Given genes provide targets for drug development. 'One can seriously question the long-term sustainable growth and economic viability of the whole industry, as well as the future of a pharmaceutical R and D strategy consisting of developing new leads for the same targets over and over again,' said Dr Claverie. But his views were not universally accepted. When Dr Venter relayed his gloomy predictions about the pharmaceutical industry to two industry executives, 'they almost fell off their chairs laughing'.And Prof Fields argued that even a single bacterium, with its interactions between proteins and a host of other molecules, 'is far more complex than an airplane'.Intriguingly, the new estimate of our overall number of genes chimes with ideas put forward many years ago by the pioneer of the modern synthesis of Darwin's ideas with genetics, J B S Haldane. In 1937 Haldane speculated that there was a limit to the number of genes in the recipe of an organism, beyond which it would suffer too many deleterious mutations to survive.Three decades later, this was used to estimate the overall gene number to be 30,000 - similar to what was disclosed last week."

Scientists want to extend this for the study of embryonic stem cells that can be used to create cells and transplant tissue to treat leukaemia, heart disease, burns and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's.But when I asked Mr Blair the hypothetical question of whether - if he and his wife, Cherie, had undergone fertility treatment - they would have been happy to donate their surplus frozen embryos to research, he admitted that, 'for the first time in all the press conferences I have done, I am completely stumped for an answer'.He declined to 'get into this very personal question', triggering speculation among journalists that his lack of frankness was born of a fear of tabloid headlines declaring that the Prime Minister wanted to clone himself. Parliament will vote on the recommendation from the Government's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Liam Donaldson, that such embryo research should be allowed to proceed because of the medical benefits.Despite vigorous pro-life opposition, Mr Blair gave his support last week at the European Bioscience Conference in London. 'Stem cell research has huge potential to improve the lives of those suffering from disease . . . so long as clear and effective regulation remains in place,' he said.He reiterated this yesterday, along with the plea that 'our conviction about what is natural or right should not inhibit the role of science in discovering the truth; rather it should inform our judgment about the implications and consequences of the truth science uncovers'.The controversial issue opened up a divide among ministers. While Lord Sainsbury, science minister, gave an unequivocal 'yes' to the use of his embryos, Stephen Byers, the Trade and Industry Secretary, took the same line as the Prime Minister.The ministers had gathered at Downing Street to announce how new funding for science would be used to boost medical research, along with the next generation of computing power and fundamental new technologies. Announcing allocations to research councils from the Science Budget for the next three years, Mr Byers said £252 million was to be invested in three areas 'that will shape life in the 21st century': Genomics (£110 million). This investment in the uses of human genetics builds on the publication of the draft human genetic code - genome - earlier this year, an effort in which Britain played a major role. Mr Byers said that the Government would do all it could to support a plan by the Wellcome Trust to build a genome campus in Cambridgeshire. e-science (£98 million). Global collaboration on the internet and the handling of vast amounts of data generated by science. Basic technology (£44 million). Research areas that could lead to major new industries, such as quantum computing, bio-engineering, photonics and nanotechnology.'Science has the potential to break new ground every day,' said Mr Byers, adding that Britain had the potential to be 'a world leader in science'. Mr Byers said that long-term investment, not a one-off injection of funding, was required so that Britain could plan its research with confidence. There would be a 'remarkable' 45 per cent increase in real terms spending between 1997 and 2004.He attacked the cuts of previous administrations. Given the economic benefits of science, 'we would stand condemned by future generations if we failed at this moment to make the necessary investment to realise these opportunities'."

The DNA in the nucleus of one cell from a patient is transferred into an emptied (enucleated) egg. The egg reprograms the DNA from the cell and the resulting reconstructed embryo - the clone of the cell donor - is triggered to divide with electricity.          Last year, the team collected 242 eggs from 16 unpaid women volunteers and 'reprogrammed' their eggs with DNA from the women's cumulus cells, which surround the eggs. The scientists then cultured 30 embryos but obtained only one stem cell line.           In the new work, 18 women donated 185 eggs. The cells to reprogram them were obtained from 11 donors, who included males and females ranging in age from 2 to 56, including individuals who had juvenile diabetes, spinal cord injury and a genetic immune deficiency.

dailymail,22/06/2015 14:35,sciencetech,"The tree of life on Earth may need to be redrawn after scientists discovered new groups of bacteria totally unlike anything discovered before.Researchers have identified 35 new phyla of bacteria they believe sit on a branch of the evolutionary tree that is completely separate from other types of bacteria.Some of the new bacteria are the smallest life forms yet to be discovered on Earth – just 400 nanometres across, about 250 times smaller than the width of a human hair.Professor Jill Banfield, an environmental scientist at the University of California in Berkeley who led the work, said: 'This is a new view of the tree of life.'These new major features on the tree of life mean that it probably won't be the simple three-domain view we have now.'Currently the taxonomic system used by scientists to classify living organisms divides into three main domains – bacteria, Archaea – primitive bacteria-like microbes – and eurkaryotes, which are all multicellular organisms including plants, animals and fungi.While the eukaryotic domain is fairly well classified into 35 separate phyla, those of bacteria and Archaea are far less well understood.Phyla is the taxonomic classification that sits just below the domains. So within the eukaryotes, the phylum Chordata includes humans and all other vertebrates.Many microbes that grow in the natural world, however, cannot be grown in the laboratory, meaning scientists have struggled to study them in detail.Now in a paper published in the journal Nature, Professor Banfield and her colleagues sequenced the genomes of organisms found in ground water at a site beside the Colorado river in Rifle Colorado.Using filters to catch the bacteria they then used shotgun-sequencing on the DNA of the microbes they found and then analysed them with a technique known as metagenomics.They then assembled the millions of DNA pieces into eight complete bacterial genomes from four new and one previously studied phyla.They also produced draft genomes – more than 90 per cent complete – for a further 789 other bacteria.In total they discovered bacteria from 35 new phyla that appeared very unlike any previously studied bacteria.Professor Banfield and her colleagues found the new bacteria they discovered appear to use a simple process of fermentation to make the energy they need.They also have unusual ribosomes, the protein-based machinery that translate genetic information into proteins.They have placed them into an entirely new branch of the tree of life they have called the 'candidate phyla radiation' due to their similarities to each other.They estimate there could be more than 250 phyla in this radiation and the new groups make up more than 15 percent of all known groups or phyla of bacteria.The work highlights the sheer diversity of life that is still to be discovered by scientists.These new phyla were found from just one site using samples of groundwater in Colorado but many more could exist in soils, rivers, oceans and even deep underground around the world.It comes after the same group of scientists identified nine new groups of Archaea, which they say could also form a new branch of the tree of life.Christopher Brown, a microbiologist who was part of the team who took part in the study at the University of California Berkeley, said: 'We were really surprised to find how diverse these groups are within the bacterial domain, and just how consistently different the organisms within this radiation are from the rest of bacteria.'No one had been able to put all the pieces together before.'The differences between the newly discovered bacteria and other known bacteria may be part of the reason why they are so hard to grow in the laboratory.They have extremely small genomes and appear to be 'stripped down' forms of life with just enough genes needed to survive.There are an estimated 100 bacterial phyla, but just 29 have species that will grow in laboratory cultures.The team has now named 20 the new phyla they identified after award-winning microbiologists and one was called Berkelbacteria - after University of California Berkeley.Mr Brown added: 'I think what this is telling us is that a large part of bacteria and bacterial lifestyles are very different from what we thought before.'There is a lot of biology that we haven't been able to understand from our current methods.' "
telegraph,11/1/2001 0:00,news,"THE two scientists knighted in the New Year Honours for their contribution to biotechnology have criticised the years of delay in building a £100 million 'genome campus' in Cambridgeshire.The campus is central to efforts to make Britain the 'biotech hub' of Europe so that it can corner a market estimated to be worth £70 billion by 2005, an aim given enthusiastic support in a recent speech by Tony Blair.However, Sir John Sulston and Sir Christopher Evans are troubled by wrangling over the campus. Sir Christopher said that he had voiced concerns to Lord Sainsbury, the science minister, that further delay could lead to the campus being established abroad, possibly in America, when Cambridge is the 'obvious site'.'I do not believe that will happen, but if it did it would be a disaster,' said Sir Christopher. He added that the way parochial interests had held up a project of national importance 'scares me'.Sir John, referring to how the campus would translate genetic knowledge into lucrative medical tests and treatments, said: 'I am disappointed that we did not get this immediate link to industrial applications.'This country desperately needs as much translation as possible. Having some bright and more innovative - in the industrial sense - people next door would have been really good.'Dithering over the campus dates from 1997, when the world's largest biomedical charity, the Wellcome Trust, submitted a proposal to develop a 40,000 square metre site, next to the Sanger Centre, Hinxton. This is the hub of Britain's effort to read genetic codes, where Sir John was director, and continues his work on the human genome.Despite the promise of 1,800 jobs from work at the campus to exploit this knowledge, the proposal was opposed by South Cambridgeshire district council because of concerns about roads, housing and other infrastructure.After a public inquiry, John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, rejected Wellcome's original plan in August 1999 but put forward a compromise based on 24,000 square metres and restricted to new companies, not mature companies.The revised plan was condemned as 'daft' and 'ludicrous' by Dr Michael Morgan, chief executive of the campus. As if to underline the crucial strategic importance of the campus, offers then flooded in to build it in America, Europe, Japan and Asia.The genome campus is in danger of becoming a political embarrassment. As Mr Blair extols the importance of biotechnology - and Britain is a leading force in global efforts to read genetic codes - the Wellcome is still struggling to devise a proposal based on the scaled down compromise.Despite helpful discussions with the local authorities, devising a viable proposal based on the compromise plan 'is proving extremely difficult', said Dr Morgan. 'You would not get a return that would justify that investment, in fact you are looking at a £45 million deficit.'A Government blunder has not helped. A letter from the Department of Environment referred to a compromise site of only 14,000 square metres, a figure which remains legally in force, even though all interested parties accept that the compromise figure is actually 24,000 square metres."
dailymail,24/02/2015 21:30,news,"The UK has become the first country in the world to legalise the creation of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) babies using DNA from three people after peers overwhelmingly backed the proposals.The House of Lords voted by 280 to 48, majority 232, on a free vote to throw out a move to block regulations introducing mitochondrial donation techniques after an impassioned debate lasting nearly four hours.MPs, including all three main party leaders, voted earlier this month in the Commons in support of the pioneering techniques, which will now be legalised following Lords approval.Health minister Earl Howe said it would be 'cruel and perverse' to deny for any longer than was necessary the chance of some women who carry serious inherited diseases to have healthy children.Tory former Cabinet minister John Gummer, known in the Lords as Lord Deben, put forward a motion rejecting the move until a joint committee of MPs and peers had reported on safety procedures, but his plan was rejected in the vote. The regulations themselves were then nodded through by peers moments later. Chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies backed the amendment to the 2008 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.Scientists at Newcastle University have developed a way of swapping the mother-to-be's diseased mitochondria – the 'batteries' that give cells energy – with healthy ones from another woman's egg. Dame Sally said: 'I want them to consider in the Lords what this is. It's quite separate from the illegal act of changing DNA in the nucleus.'It would give these women their own children and these families hope, and I believe this is right.'We have a very strong regulatory system that would regulate first the service and secondly would review every individual case before they could happen.'The Government's most senior health advisor admitted if the treatment fails there would be an increased miscarriage rate, but added that there was 'no expectation of that'.Critics have pointed out no clinical trial has taken place to show conclusively that the treatments are safe in humans.However, three separate expert reviews for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority found that the technique is ready to go forward.Dame Sally said: 'The only clinical tests you can do are either in rats, mice and monkeys - and those have been done - or in humans and the mothers now want to do this following those three scientific reviews.'I wouldn't call it a test, but the first cases will be scrutinised very carefully.'She also denied the legislation would lead to a 'slippery slope' giving way to the creation of designer babies. Opponents, including church leaders and pro-life groups, have warned that the change will create 'three parent families' and has been brought about too hastily.But Lord Howe said the move to permit the controversial procedures, aimed at preventing serious inherited, mitochondrial diseases, offered 'real hope' to families.'My own position, shared by ministerial colleagues, is very simple,' he told a packed chamber.'Families can see the technology is there to help them and are keen to take it up.'It would be cruel and perverse in my judgment to deny them that opportunity for any longer than absolutely necessary.'Lord Howe said the purpose of the regulations was to enable women to have their own genetic children free of 'terrible disease' caused by disorders in their mitochondrial DNA.The regulations did so by allowing 'healthy mitochondria' from a donor to replace the 'unhealthy mitochondria' in a woman's egg or embryo, he told peers.And he said the techniques offered the only hope for some women to have healthy genetically-related children 'who will not suffer from the devastating and often fatal consequences of serious mitochondrial disease'.Lord Howe said the Government was clear it was acting within EU law and the legislation was 'sound and robust'.The regulations allow the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to consider the procedure for women carrying mitochondrial disease.Lord Deben argued it had not yet been proved the techniques were safe and there was uncertainty about their legality.'If we talked about transferring the spindle from one egg to another I would not have any ethical objection - in fact I would want to support it,' he said. 'There are real doubts about safety.'He told peers he supported genetically modified crops and said: 'The testing and the science is to me clear.'If the testing and the science in this case was as clear, as complete and as total, I believe I would be able to vote for one of these two proposals, but it isn't.'He added: 'We are trying to protect three sets of people - families, mothers and fathers; children; and the wider society.'We would be the first country in the world to allow this. We have to be very careful that we do so with full and wholehearted support and also that we have fulfilled the safety needs.' A free vote in the Commons saw 382 MPs vote in favour of the controversial technology. Some 128 voted against. Labour peer and leading fertility expert Lord Winston said: 'What we are doing if we decide not to vote for Lord Deben's amendment is expressing our concern as a House and our compassion for people who are faced with a really invidious and horrendous choice.'Under those circumstances, given that this is going to be a limited procedure really affecting very few people, it would be utterly wrong for this House to turn down the democratically-elected chamber and not to support what the Government have proposed.'Lord Patel, an independent crossbench peer and retired professor of obstetrics, played down the safety fears raised by Lord Deben.He told peers: 'Decisions of safety and efficacy should be taken by the statutory regulatory authority created to do this, the HFEA.'Risks must be balanced. Evidence suggests that any risk of mitochondrial donations are proportionality less than the significant risk that children will continue to be born and develop severe mitochondrial disease if these techniques are not used.'Ultimately it will be up to the affected families to judge the risks - they are the ones who will take the risks.'The Bishop of Carlisle, the Rt Rev James Newcome, said the Church of England was not opposed in principle to mitochondrial transfer.'But at the same time we have always counselled a degree of caution given the potential implications of this development,' he said.He said research tests into safety should be completed and reported before the change was approved and expressed disappointment over the 'element of rush'.The Bishop said: 'Both personally and as a representative of the Church of England I am basically very much in favour of this development.'But I cannot ignore the compelling arguments against pushing this through in haste.'Tory former Cabinet minister Lord Tebbit told peers: 'There is only one absolutely safe way to ensure that this genetic disease is not handed down from generation to generation and that is for those women who are carriers of the genetic fault not to have children.'That may be an appalling thing for me to have said, many people would think, but there are many people who for various reasons cannot have children.' The UK's fertility sector regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, said it would now develop a licencing framework for clinics planning to offer this treatment. Sally Cheshire, Chair of the HFEA, said: 'After many years of scientific and ethical debate, Parliament has decided today to permit the use of mitochondrial donation to give families with serious mitochondrial disease the possibility of having their own healthy genetic children. 'Britain is the first country in the world to permit this treatment, and it is a testament to the scientific expertise and well-respected regulatory regime that exists across the UK that Parliament has felt able to approve it. 'The HFEA now have to develop a robust licensing process, which takes into account on a case by case basis the technical and ethical complexities of such treatments to ensure that any children born have the best chance of a healthy life.' "
telegraph,27/06/2015 08:00,news,"The US health watchdog has clamped down on 23andMe, the affordable DNA-testing service. Anne Wojcicki, its founder, is sticking to her guns  Anne Wojcicki, the founder and CEO of the genetic-testing company 23andMe, is at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History to speak at the annual Personalized Medicine World Conference about genetics and the revolution that she feels her company has begun. ‘I think your genetics are going to be a blueprint of your health,’ she tells me. ‘My dream is that one day you’ll know what type of diet is right for you; or if, like Angelina Jolie, you're at a higher risk of breast cancer, you could potentially have a double mastectomy. I think there’s no better opportunity to have a positive impact on someone’s life.’  Wojcicki, 42, founded 23andMe in April 2006 with two aims: supplying people with affordable genetic testing so they can take appropriate steps to improve their health and divert illnesses they may be susceptible to; and using the resulting data to arm doctors and scientists in the fight against genetic-mutation diseases.  ‘One of the most important things we’re going to do in the next 20 or 30 years is change how we approach research,’ she says. ‘I think what’s interesting about the UK is that there is quite a culture of research and prevention.

The email alerts you to your results, securely detailed online: 11 ‘genetic risk factors’ are analysed (how at risk you are to Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s disease, for example); ‘drug response’ reports provide information on how your genetics may affect responses to certain medications; you will find out how likely you are to pass on 43 ‘inherited conditions’ (from cystic fibrosis to sickle-cell anaemia); and you will discover your genetic inclinations towards 38 ‘traits’ (from male pattern baldness to lactose intolerance). For the ‘genetic risk factor’ results, 23andMe provides the percentage chance the customer has of contracting the conditions or diseases based on the tests. These are shown next to the national average so as not to cause undue alarm. Customers can also elect not to discover some of the more potentially distressing results. ‘There are still a lot of questions over whether consumers can handle the information,’ Wojcicki says.

(They have a seven-year-old son and a four-year-old daughter, but in August 2014 announced their separation.) Six months later 23andMe began selling its $999 testing kits on the American market, and within a year it had been crowned Time magazine’s Invention of the Year, had featured on Oprah Winfrey’s talk show, and had been awarded a $1 million grant by the US National Institutes of Health, the US government’s research agency. As the investment kept pouring in, Wojcicki was able to steadily drop the price of the testing kit; by 2012 it was down to $99. By the end of 2013 23andMe had attracted $126 million of investment and more than 400,000 customers. Then came the FDA’s suspension.  .tg-pullquote__global__group{zoom: 1;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:before, .tg-pullquote__global__group:after{content: ''; display: table;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:after{clear: both;}.tg-pullquote__inline{float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content{margin: 0 20px 10px 0px; font-size:18px; line-height:23px; font-family:georgia; width:260px; float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content--mobile{float: none; font-size: 18px; margin-left: 4.687%; margin-right: 4.687%; width: 90.626%;}.tg-pullquote__title{font-family:arial; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px; border-top:1px dotted #000000;}.tg-pullquote__quote{color:#007A8F; font-style:italic; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__attribution{color:#787878; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__source{}.tg-pullquote__source__link{color:#234B7B; outline:0; text-decoration:none;}.tg-pullquote__source__link:hover{border-bottom: 1px dotted #122842; color: #122842;}.tg-pullquote__share{float:right;}.tg-pullquote__share--icon{background-image:url('http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.png'); background-image: url('http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.svg'), none; width:26px; height:26px;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink{border-bottom:none;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink:hover{border-bottom:none !important;}.tg-pullquote__share--twitter{margin-right:5px;}.tg-pullquote__share--facebook{background-position: 26px 0;}        'Health care is the ultimate equaliser of humanity.

In 2010 it informed the company that its genetic tests were now considered medical devices and as such required federal approval to market them. 23andMe filed applications for clearance in July and September 2012, but was unsuccessful. In November 2013 the FDA ruled that 23andMe had not demonstrated that it had ‘analytically or clinically validated the Personal Genome Service for its intended uses’ and stated that it was ‘concerned about the public health consequences of inaccurate results from the PGS device’.  There has been concern in the UK, too. When 23andMe was debated in the House of Lords in December last year Lord Howe, on behalf of the Government, said, ‘The Government has advised that no test will be 100 per cent reliable, that 23andMe should be used with caution and that the information provided by 23andMe should not lead consumers to make any changes of medical significance, such as changes to medication, without first consulting their health-care professional.’ On its launch in the UK, the Alzheimer’s Society commented, ‘If you are worried about your memory, your GP should be the first port of call – not a home DNA-testing kit. Research has identified a number of genes that may play a role in the development of dementia but we don’t know enough to use these as a diagnostic tool.’ The Department of Health urged people to think carefully before using private genomic services as ‘no test is 100 per cent reliable’.   Registers to 23andMe are sent a kit for collecting a saliva sample  ‘I don’t think we’re playing God,’ Wojcicki says when I ask about the criticism. ‘We’re trying to help people really understand. In the same way that if you look in the mirror and you see a mole that looks funny, you want to do something about it, so you will also look in your genome. I have mothers with small children come to me and say, “You found that I had early breast cancer – because of you I don’t have cancer.” You’ve just prevented that person from dying early, and to prevent an early, unnecessary death is incredibly meaningful. We have so many of these stories now, people writing in just to say thank you. I love that.’  The new frontline of genetics  After screening her own genetic data, Wojcicki reduced her alcohol intake to minimise her heightened risk of breast cancer, quit coconut water as she is slightly predisposed to diabetes, and wards off anaemia with extra iron in the form of beef burgers. ‘I discovered that I need meat,’ she says. ‘It’s interesting, I think genetically there are people who need different things, like exercise. I need the exercise, others not so much, and I think more and more we’ll start to understand why people’s bodies function in certain ways. I look at my mother, for example, and she doesn’t need much sleep. She’s super high energy all the time and can’t stand coffee. I think that we’ll start to understand all these types of variations, and then this will help individuals manage their life.’  .tg-pullquote__global__group{zoom: 1;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:before, .tg-pullquote__global__group:after{content: ''; display: table;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:after{clear: both;}.tg-pullquote__inline{float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content{margin: 0 20px 10px 0px; font-size:18px; line-height:23px; font-family:georgia; width:260px; float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content--mobile{float: none; font-size: 18px; margin-left: 4.687%; margin-right: 4.687%; width: 90.626%;}.tg-pullquote__title{font-family:arial; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px; border-top:1px dotted #000000;}.tg-pullquote__quote{color:#007A8F; font-style:italic; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__attribution{color:#787878; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__source{}.tg-pullquote__source__link{color:#234B7B; outline:0; text-decoration:none;}.tg-pullquote__source__link:hover{border-bottom: 1px dotted #122842; color: #122842;}.tg-pullquote__share{float:right;}.tg-pullquote__share--icon{background-image:url('http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.png'); background-image: url('http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.svg'), none; width:26px; height:26px;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink{border-bottom:none;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink:hover{border-bottom:none !important;}.tg-pullquote__share--twitter{margin-right:5px;}.tg-pullquote__share--facebook{background-position: 26px 0;}        'I have mothers with small children come to me and say, “You found that I had early breast cancer – because of you I don’t have cancer”'          Anne Wojcicki        (function(){var meta=document.getElementsByName('DCSext.Platform'); if( meta.length===0) return; if( meta[0].getAttribute('content') !=='mobile')return; var targets=document.querySelectorAll('.tg-pullquote__content'); var len=targets.length; while( len-- ){targets[ len].className +=' tg-pullquote__content--mobile';}})();document.getElementById('tg-pullquote143516181055153').innerHTML = '<div id='tg-pullquote__shareContainer' class='tg-pullquote__share tg-pullquote__global__group'><a class='tg-pullquote__inline tg-pullquote__shareLink' target='_blank' href='http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text='I%20have%20mothers%20with%20small%20children%20come%20to%20me%20and%20say%2C%20%E2%80%9CYou%20found%20that%20I%20had%20early%20breast%20cancer%20%E2%80%93%20because%20of%20you%20I%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20cancer%E2%80%9D'&amp;url='+window.location.href+'?WT.mc_id=tmgoff_pq_tw_20150423'><div class='tg-pullquote__share--icon tg-pullquote__share--twitter'> </div></a><a class='tg-pullquote__inline tg-pullquote__shareLink' href='http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u='+window.location.href+'?WT.mc_id=tmgoff_pq_fb_20150423' target='_blank'><div class='tg-pullquote__share--icon tg-pullquote__share--facebook'> </div></a></div>'; She and Brin had their daughter’s DNA tested antenatally, and their son’s when he was an infant. Brin’s own results showed a high risk of Parkinson’s. His mother, Eugenia, suffers from the disease, and he possesses the same LRRK2 genetic mutation, putting his odds of inheriting Parkinson’s at anything from 20 to 80 per cent. (The average person, according to 23andMe, has a 1-2 per cent chance of developing Parkinson’s.) He has since upped his coffee intake and workout regimen – two behaviours thought to stem the disease. The couple donated $50 million to the Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, and 23andMe began its own Parkinson’s Research Community, enrolling more than 10,000 people to form the largest group of genotyped people with Parkinson’s in the world. The resulting data have allowed scientists to analyse and better understand the relationship between environmental and genetic factors in the development of the disease.  ‘If you can collect enough data – and I think understanding human health is a data question, so you need to collect enough data, which is part of the beauty of the system that we have – then we’re all helping each other learn about ourselves,’ Wojcicki says. ‘Your data might help us understand something about someone else on the other side of the world but, collectively, we’re all going to understand much better about human health.’  Research is a key component of the 23andMe model. People who register for DNA testing on the website are invited to share their data, and so far 80 per cent of its 950,000 users have opted in. In 2013, before the FDA ruling, 23andMe received more than $500,000 from the National Institutes of Health to crowd-source studies on allergies, asthma and other conditions. Through this and the website’s seemingly infinite range of surveys, more than 200 million questions have been answered, providing the company with an unprecedented bank of information (user anonymity and data protection are paramount, Wojcicki emphasises). As a result, 23andMe has published 16 peer-reviewed studies in the past three years.   Samples are sent to a lab in California, where they are analysed. PHOTO: Spencer Lowell  ‘What we’re trying to do is invent a new way of doing those massive studies,’ says Wojcicki, who has previously stated that agreeing to share information is comparable to a charity donation. ‘There’s a huge long tail of human variation and so we want to run massive studies and really start to understand how disease, genotype and environment all interact.’  Despite the positivity around its research work, 23andMe still has its hands tied when it comes to health-related services in the States, although in February this year the FDA did grant the company authorisation to market its test for one rare disorder, Bloom disease. The company describes this as ‘the first step in 23andMe’s commitment to returning health information to their US customers’.  Wojcicki remains positive. And very confident. ‘The goal was a million people [to have taken the tests], so we’re almost there,’ she says. ‘Do I want 25 million? I want almost everyone. When I lived in New York I really couldn’t stand the financial inequalities I saw, and the thing about health care is that it’s the ultimate equaliser of humanity. It doesn’t matter how rich or poor you are, when you’re sick you want the exact same thing. My mother said to me in her first discussion with me about genetics, when I was about my son’s age, “There’s genes and there’s environment and they both influence each other.” You must understand that you’re dealt this deck of cards, but you can influence it. And I’ve definitely seen a lot of people who are sick that are unnecessarily sick – they got sick early and there’s nothing you can do. And so, how do you prevent that in the future?   Wojcicki says: 'If you look in the mirror and you see a mole that looks funny, you want to do something about it, so you will also look in your genome.'   ‘You don’t do new things and try to change the system without generating debate. So we’ve encouraged that debate, that discussion and those opportunities to really engage with individuals as we are trying to change it. We’re trying to be more radical, and we understand that will definitely make people concerned. But it’s our job then to be as communicative and available as possible, so people can feel comfortable with what we’re doing. Medicine is clearly changing quite a bit and it’s changing in that consumers are taking more control over it. The US and the UK are super different and I think it’s all because of the payment system. One of the reasons I was excited to come to the UK was the NHS. Because of the NHS and the single-payer system there is much more of an incentive to understand who gets what care and at what time.’  Back in Oxford Anne Wojcicki is soon due on stage to thank the attendees who have supplied saliva to 23andMe (many of whom are sporting the company’s 'I SPAT' badges handed out on entry). We talk about Angelina Jolie. ‘The second editorial she wrote [for The New York Times in March] ends with “knowledge is power”,’ she says. ‘It’s a really powerful statement that we use a lot. I do think that, ultimately, knowledge is powerful for people. Not everyone wants the information, and that’s a personal choice, but having information can be incredibly powerful for individuals. You can be proactive once you have the information.’ "
telegraph,12/12/2008 17:11,news,"The Vatican has denounced artificial fertility treatments and the morning after pill as immoral but backed stem cell experiments using adult cells.  In its first major statement on reproductive science in 20 years, the Roman Catholic Church also condemned human cloning, designer babies and the use of embryos in medical research.The document, approved by Pope Benedict XVI, reaffirms the church's view that human life is sacred at every stage of its existence, and that babies should be created simply by married couples having sexual intercourse.The 32-page document, called Dignitas Personae, has been drawn up by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to give the church's authoritative view on recent developments in medicine and science.It says that human cloning – illegal around the world – is 'intrinsically illicit' because it involves the creation of life without loving parents.The document also condemns the creation of hybrid human-animal embryos – demanded by researchers looking to cure diseases because of a shortage of human eggs – which is now legal in the UK thanks to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. But the Vatican says that stem cell research 'should be encouraged' if the tissue is obtained from adults, umbilical cord blood or foetuses that have died naturally. This comes just weeks after British scientists successfully created a replacement windpipe for a woman using adult stem cells.The document restates Catholic doctrine that IVF is immoral because it involves the 'discarding' of embryos, and also condemns fertility treatments that involve the freezing of embryos or the injecting of sperm into eggs because they 'substitute for the conjugal act'.It also declares the screening or modifying of the genes of embryos – creating so-called 'designer babies' – immoral and warns that those who try to create new types of human are playing God.Birth control methods such as the morning after pill, abortion pills and the coil are also called sinful.However, hormone treatment for infertility and one form of gene therapy – somatic – is permitted.

telegraph,30/03/2002 00:01,news,"THE world's first cloned rabbits were unveiled yesterday by a team of French scientists.While cloning might seem redundant in view of the bunny's ability to reproduce naturally, the use of cloning combined with genetic modification could lead to the development of GM rabbits that model human disease and can be milked for drugs. The animals will also help understand the health effects of cloning. Dr Jean-Paul Renard, head of the team, said: 'The two first clones, now one year old, have normally reproduced, to respectively seven and eight kits, and their offspring are growing normally.' He added: 'The rabbits are in good health.'He said that the team decided to wait before announcing the cloned rabbits to ensure that they were normal and fertile.Previous attempts by scientists around the world to clone rabbits had been disappointing.He said: 'To achieve this success, we have designed a specific cloning procedure adapted to the physiological characteristics of rabbit oocytes [eggs] and early embryonic development.'The announcement was made in the journal Nature Biotechnology by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), BioProtein Technologies, a French biotech company specialising in the production of protein drugs in the milk of transgenic rabbits, in collaboration with Vivalis, which specialises in stem cells and making protein drugs in eggs.The cloning was achieved using the Dolly the sheep method - nuclear transfer from adult cells.By using cells that have been successfully genetically modified in the cloning process, it is possible to carry out much more precise genetic modification.Rabbits can produce up to eight litres of milk per year. From the annual production of 400 rabbits, 5-10 kg of proteins can be isolated and purified to a very high quality. The proteins can be used as drugs.Vivalis has an exclusive rights option from INRA for applications of this technology in animal models for research purposes and therapeutic applications other than those exploited by BioProtein.The rabbit offers several advantages over other laboratory species in the study of some human disorders. Because of its larger size, they are easier to manipulate than mice and, in evolutionary terms, rabbits are closer to primates than rodents.Both Bioprotein Technologies and Vivalis, in conjunction with INRA, stressed that cloning requires careful step-by-step validation of its applications, including ethical implications, and that they will carry out a public consultation exercise.Franck Grimaud, Vivalis's chief executive officer, said: 'This new development achieved by one of the world's leading teams in cloning will allow us to offer our customers rabbit models genetically identical for experimental purposes.' He added: 'We are also conducting further research into the use of this technology for specific therapeutic applications.' Marc Le Bozec, BioProtein Technologies' chief executive officer, said: 'Today's announcement highlights the cutting edge cloning science that we are able to access from our scientific partner INRA.'He added: 'Thus, we are able, by using transgenic rabbits, to offer our customers a number of commercially important advantages over other animal or cell based systems currently used for therapeutic protein production.'"
telegraph,24/10/2010 07:45,news,"The XCell-Center, which would be banned in the UK, has been able to thrive in Germany due to a legal loophole about to be closed under new European legislation. The law governing stem cell clinics is extremely complex.The UK classifies stem cell treatments as medicines. This means that before   procedures can be licensed, the therapies must undergo the same kind of   rigorous trials as those used for other medicines. The stem cell therapies must first be shown to be safe and effective before   they can be licensed for use by the general public.Experts predict a stem cell treatment for multiple sclerosis for example could   be between five and ten years away, given the regulatory hoops that must be   jumped through first.The time it takes to prove scientifically that the treatment both works and is   safe has allowed clinics like XCell to spring up abroad attracting foreign   patients in large numbers. Such treatments are also currently unavailable in   the US and in many other countries in Europe.But how much longer XCell will be allowed to operate in Germany is not clear. A European Union regulation passed in 2007 now defines stem cell   transplantation as a medicine and Germany has come into line with that.   Under the regulation, XCell has until 2012 to show its treatments are   effective and safe."
telegraph,25/05/2008 00:01,comment,"This life is full of disappointments, but last week was quite something. After two days' debate in the Commons, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill got its second reading. Every measure I'd hoped to see struck down got through, and every amendment I'd hoped to see passed got struck down.         Some issues mattered more than others. I'm all in favour of children having fathers or, at least, father-figures, but the requirement that would-be IVF parents should have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of a fertility clinic functionary that there would be some sort of fatherly presence in their children's lives seemed more a matter of form-filling than substance - though fair play to Iain Duncan Smith for making an issue of it. That got nowhere.         Creating animal-human hybrids was quite another matter. I could see that MPs, pragmatic creatures that they are, might take a breezy approach to creating embryos with just a teeny-weeny animal element. But a proper half-and-half hybrid - an animal-human from the sperm of one species and egg of another - that's quite something. It's an embryonic Minotaur. Tory health spokesman Andrew Lansley put forward an amendment to ban the creation of half-and-half hybrids; that got nowhere.         Saviour siblings - creating a child specifically for the purpose of harvesting their bone marrow or umbilical fluid - were approved, and with them the principle that a human being can be instrumentalised, created simply as a means to someone else's ends.         Then there were the votes on late abortions. Each amendment to restrict the time limit was voted down: 12 weeks, 16 weeks, 20 weeks, 22 weeks. We're left with the status quo - whereby something that looks like a baby and acts like a baby can be given a lethal injection in the womb on the say-so of its mother - which most hospital doctors simply refuse to do.          The news presenter on the BBC, where I was a commentator that night, said brightly to me: 'Well, a series of defeats for the social conservatives and a victory for the social progressives, don't you think?' That's one way of looking at it.         Lisa Jardine, the ubiquitous history professor fronting the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which will implement this bill, took an even more upbeat approach to the votes. 'It shows that we're a society that goes where the evidence leads us', she said.          Yet that's precisely what last week's votes don't show. What they do suggest is that MPs are sentimentalists, swayed by arguments that a moral leap in the dark may result in progress of some kind, so let's just go for it. In other words, old-fashioned utilitarians.         On the abortion issue, for instance, there's actually quite an interesting body of research that suggests that a foetus can feel pain prior to 26 weeks' gestation, on the basis that it uses parts of the brain formed much earlier in its development - that it doesn't rely on fully formed neural connections between thalamus and cortex to register sensations.          But the arguments from MPs like Chris McCafferty against a change in the time limit for abortions were almost entirely based on the mother's wishes and circumstances - meaning that the humanity of the foetus effectively depends on whether or not its mother wants to continue with the pregnancy. Going with the evidence? Really?         I could go on - there is actually very little evidence that the creation of human-admixed embryos, hybrids, are necessary to the future of stem cell research. Most advances in that field are the product of adult-derived stem cells, and there are entirely non-controversial new sources of stem cells.          Naturally, MPs talked instead about the ghastly degenerative diseases that the technology might possibly help cure - but that's lawmaking on the basis of optimism, not on scrupulous examination of evidence.         The only good thing about the arguments that preceded last week's votes is that they demonstrated just how nuanced these questions are. They don't break down into God-botherers versus scientists, progressives versus reactionaries.          It's scientists arguing with scientists, women with other women, ordinary people with the experts. And those arguments haven't been resolved in the few days alloted to them - Socrates couldn't have done it. David Cameron has said that he is 'open' to the possibility that these issues could be raised again in a Conservative parliament. He's right - he should make that a commitment.                     Don't be squeamish, boil a bunny today                  There's been an awful fuss about Gordon Ramsay's decision to show a rabbit being hunted by ferrets and then having its neck broken on his Channel 4 show, The F Word. Agitated viewers called the RSPCA to complain about bunny slaughter, especially as it took place in front of Mr Ramsay's young son.          Presumably they think ferreting is, like fox-hunting with dogs, a wicked thing to do. Yet by all accounts, the bunny was quickly despatched.          Actually, Mr Ramsay is doing us all a favour by eating rabbit. It is low-fat, iron-rich and nutritious meat. Nutritionist Jane Clark calls it the new superfood, which makes a change from blueberrries and spinach.          The meat is more environmentally friendly than beef, which Mr Ramsay's viewers presumably eat without a qualm, and rabbits have free-range lives that the battery chickens featured in most British takeaway sandwiches could only envy. They are also a pest the Department of the Environment wants to control, with or without ferrets.          Mr Ramsay is to be applauded. We should all do our bit for the environment and the farming community by eating as many wild rabbits as possible. Fergus Henderson does a very good recipe for braised rabbit in his latest cookbook. And another, equally good, for wild grey squirrel stew - even environmentally friendlier. I shall be interested to read how Gordon Ramsay serves them.                     I blame the bridegroom's mother                  Just as well that Peter Phillips and his bride, Autumn, are somewhere far from England, what with all the fuss about their wedding photographs in Hello! magazine. Apparently his cousins, William and Harry, are 'very unhappy' that their girlfriends' pictures are all over the '100-page special', though I fancy the girls themselves aren't so put out, given that the photos were so very flattering.          That one of the two of them giggling in the chapel stalls - didn't it remind you a bit of Diana and Fergie? Ahem. As for the Queen, she is said to be anything but pleased.         'There is a great deal of difference between being aware of what is happening and giving one's approval,' said one courtier.         Well, yes indeed. Though you'd have thought that if she was aware of the deal, she could have insisted that no photograph of her was going to appear as part of it. What I really want to know is why it was necessary at all.         Apart from motives of greed, obviously. We were told, affectingly, that the bride's divorced parents couldn't pay for the £50,000 reception. Stuffed wild mushrooms with crisp leeks in a brioche crust and carpaccio of beef en croute does not come cheap.          However, the Queen lent her grandson Frogmore House and St George's chapel, which must have helped. Hello! paid the happy couple half a million pounds for their photos and interviews - so that leaves £450,000 for those household items that every young couple can do with, even in a home they have shared for two years.         Some commentators have been quick to blame the bride and groom for dragging the Royal family into the deal, with 'insiders' saying it was largely Autumn's doing. Personally, I blame Princess Anne. She has a forthright way of expressing herself and could have deployed it to tell her son that he was making them look like fools, and that she would, if necessary, pay for a simple reception, like her own last one, involving sandwiches.         As for Princess Beatrice's flock-of-butterflies hat and dress - a friend who knows these things says the dress was by Alexander McQueen, the cutting-edge designer, and the hat by Philip Treacy.

Go for Roundup,' read one placard at another French protest in the western city of Rennes.In Burkina Faso, around 500 people marched in the capital Ouagadougou against the US giant, which introduced GM cotton into the west African country in 2003.Demonstrators demanded a 10-year moratorium on the planting of Monsanto seeds so 'independent research can be conducted' into the effects of the technology.Up to 1,000 anti-Monsanto activists also gathered in front of the European Parliament in Strasbourg as the sun was setting for a minute's silence 'in homage to the existing and future victims poisoned by pesticides,' according to the organisers.There were similar scenes in Los Angeles and Rio de Janiero.Up to 500 protesters, including families with small children, took part in a colourful and good-natured rally under the sun in Los Angeles.'I'm not a science experiment,' read the sign of a young girl in a pushchair, while demonstrators chanted: 'Hell no GMO!''Monsanto is doing terrible things and that's why we're here,' said protester Carole Walker.Megan Cliburn added: 'We should be able to know what's in our food when we are eating; what we are putting in our body.'Another 250 people danced and sang in a noisy demonstration in Rio, accusing Monsanto of 'bioterrorism.'About 1,000 people in Chile's capital Santiago demanded the withdrawal of Monsanto from the country and the end of production of genetically modified foods.'We do not want GMOs on our plates,' said Ivan Santandreu, president of the movement Chile sin Transgenicos.Monsanto did not immediately reply to a request for comment."

A team of British scientists has succeeded in making stem cells develop into simple tissue structures that work like human heart valves.            Sir Magdi Yacoub, a leading heart surgeon at Imperial College London, head of a team working on ways to overcome the shortage of donated hearts for transplant, said the breakthrough was a significant step on the way to growing whole new organs. Yesterday, scientists welcomed the development but cautioned that the work was 'very preliminary', and that tests in animals were unlikely before 2010.            Asked to predict how long it would be before researchers could grow a whole, beating heart, Sir Magdi said: 'It is an ambitious project but not impossible. If you want me to guess I'd say 10 years.'         The human heart has four valves designed to ensure blood flows in only one direction through the heart.         Heart valve disease, which can be either inherited or acquired, occurs either when the valve leaks, allowing a backwards flow of blood, or when it will not open fully, impeding the flow of blood.         In 2003 almost 10,000 people needed surgery to replace heart valves with artificial ones made of plastic or metal.         While artificial valves do save lives, children need to have them replaced as they grow and patients must take drugs for the rest of their lives to prevent complications.         A patient who had heart tissue grown from their own stem cells should not need to take drugs to avoid the body rejecting it. Valves grown from a patient's own cells should mean that he or she need not take drugs to stop the body rejecting it.         Sir Magdi's team, based at Harefield Hospital in west London, extracted adult stem cells from bone marrow, cultivated them into heart value cells and put them on collagen scaffolds where they grew into discs of heart valve tissue an inch wide.         At present the engineered tissue is not strong enough to withstand the strains of circulation and do not contain vital nerves.         Dr Adrian Chester, one of the leading researchers in the team, predicted that it would be three years before they produced valve tissue strong enough to test in animals.         Dr Chester said: 'We are attempting to grow a valve that will be functional in adults and children and will be made entirely of living -tissue.                                                                  'We are trying to make sure we have as many characteristics in the tissue as accurate as we can before we do animal tests. Realistically that will take us maybe three years.'         Dr Stephen Minger, a leading stem cell expert at London's King's College, said: 'If the valves they've engineered prove successful in experimental animals, this could open the door to generating complex tissues from stem cells for a wide variety of clinical application.         'But, as they stress, this is very preliminary work and the direct translation to human is still some way off in the future.'         Heart disease is the UK's biggest killer. More than 200,000 people died from heart disease and strokes in 2004.

dailymail,20/04/2015 18:07,health,"Thousands of women whose breast cancer has become resistant to standard treatment could benefit from a new drug combination, claim researchers.It is hoped the new approach will target cancer stem cells that evade conventional drugs and cause the tumour to re-grow.Cancer that has spread and is incurable, known as secondary breast cancer, kills 1,000 women in Britain every month.Researchers from Manchester University working with drug development company Evgen Pharma, have developed a new combination of drugs which could overcome this problem.They are testing the drug Sulforadex in the most common type of breast cancer, affecting 70 per cent of patients.These ‘oestrogen receptor’ (ER) cancers are currently tackled using hormonal treatments such as tamoxifen  to reduce oestrogen levels or block ER function.However, many women go on to develop resistance and the disease comes back, often because cancer stem cells which cause tumours to regrow and spread are unaffected by these treatments.The combination therapy, tested in mice and samples of tissue from secondary breast cancer patients, combines Sulforadex with standard hormonal treatments.This targets both the oestrogen-sensitive cells and the remaining cancer stem cells at the same time, says research presented at the American Association of Cancer Research annual conference today.Dr Robert Clarke, from the University’s Institute of Cancer Sciences, said: ‘The hormonal therapies we use today are very good at treating breast cancer tumours driven by oestrogen.‘However, they don’t completely solve the problem. 'This combination of drugs potentially allows us to target oestrogen-sensitive cells, while also mopping up the cells which cause treatment resistance.’The next step will be to recruit patients for a trial in the next few months.Dr David Howat, head of research and development at Evgen Pharma said: ‘We are really excited about the data presented at the AACR. 'Dr Rob Clarke and his research team have demonstrated the efficacy of Sulforadex.‘We now intend to extend this collaboration and advance Sulforadex into a clinical trial with breast cancer patients.’ Katie Goates, at Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘While it’s important to remember that at this stage research has only been carried out in mice, this new combination of drugs shows exciting potential to overcome resistance to hormone treatments, such as tamoxifen.‘Combining tamoxifen with Sulforadex resulted in fewer breast cancer stem cells surviving treatment compared to tamoxifen alone, lowering the likelihood of breast cancer returning or spreading to other parts of the body.‘Interestingly, Dr Clarke’s team has also shown that this combination of drugs reduces the number of cancer stem cells in secondary breast cancer samples. ‘This means that the combination also has the potential to extend how long tamoxifen treatment can work for women with secondary breast cancer (cancer that has spread), the incurable form of the disease.‘Secondary breast cancer still kills 1,000 women in the UK every month so research that helps us to discover improved treatment options for women living with this form of breast cancer, or to help prevent cancer spreading, are vitally important.‘We hope that planned clinical trials will follow quickly to tell us whether using tamoxifen with Sulforadex is safe and can deliver similar results in humans.’ "
telegraph,10/11/2000 0:00,finance,"TRANSPLANTING brain stem cells to treat brain damage could happen as early as 2008, the biotechnology company ReNeuron said yesterday as it raised £19.5m to develop the technology.The company, which is floating on the Alternative Investment Market (Aim) via a placing at 195p, capitalising it at £66m, hopes to be able to combat the effects of strokes, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.Dr Martin Edwards, the company's chief executive, said: 'We are trying to replace dead and damaged areas with new human brain cells. There is a great deal of scientific evidence for this. It works very well on animals.' Stem cell technology was voted breakthrough of the year by the journal Science.ReNeuron was founded by three scientists from the psychiatry department of King's College London. They discovered the technology while studying the effect of implanting cells into rats' brains to see if they could restore them. It is backed by the venture capitalist concern Merlin, which will remain the main shareholder in the business.Dr Edwards, who trained as a medical doctor before working in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, said the cash raised would be used to take the brain stem cells into clinical trials to treat strokes in the second half of next year.He said: 'This is like a transplant but it will be regulated like a pharmaceutical, so it will be several years before it could be available.' Dr Edwards said the money would last two to 2.5 years, and that the company would need to come back to the market after that. Dealings in the shares are expected to start on November 16."
dailymail,25/03/2015 14:39,wires,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — The global pharmaceutical industry is pouring billions of dollars into developing treatments for rare diseases, which once drew little interest from major drugmakers but now point the way toward a new era of innovative therapies and big profits.The investments come as researchers harness recent scientific advances, including the mapping of the human genome, sophisticated and affordable genetic tests and laboratory robots that can screen thousands of compounds per hour in search of the most potent ones.'It's a very, very promising time,' said Jimmy Lin, a National Institutes of Health cancer researcher who co-founded the Rare Genomics Institute.By definition, a rare disease is one that strikes fewer than 200,000 Americans, sometimes only a few dozen. But with 7,000 rare diseases known to doctors, and more emerging all the time, nearly 1 in 10 Americans has a rare disease. For most, there is no treatment, let alone a cure. Just getting an accurate diagnosis often requires a medical odyssey, and 30 percent of children with a rare disease die before age 5.For decades, drugmakers were reluctant to invest in rare-disease treatments, preferring to focus on mass-market drugs for cholesterol, heart trouble and other common problems. Then, starting a decade ago, patents on some of the industry's most lucrative medicines began to expire, and cheap generic drugs started wiping out tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue.So many companies shifted money to rare-disease drugs, knowing that those medicines cost less to develop and will face limited competition. Some already sell for $100,000 or more for a year of treatment, although drugmakers usually give financial aid to patients and big discounts to insurers and government health programs.'They're recreating the blockbuster,' said analyst Steve Brozak of WBB Securities. 'There's more money, fewer patients and it's 10 times easier to defend high prices to payers.'Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved a record 17 medicines for rare diseases. More than 450 others are in development to treat a wide variety of ailments — rare cancers, sickle-cell disease, the hormonal disorder Cushing's disease and a bleeding ailment called thrombocytopenic purpura, as well as hemophilia, Hodgkin's lymphoma and pulmonary fibrosis.Patient-advocacy groups are getting better at raising money for research and building registries of patients that could be used to recruit participants for drug studies, a process that otherwise can take years.In the 1970s, only a handful of rare-disease drugs got approved. Then the 1983 Orphan Drug Act helped rouse interest by providing expedited drug reviews, tax credits and other benefits for drug companies.Since then, about 220 medicines have been approved — 93 in the last decade.For diabetes, heart and other common medications, drugmakers must test treatments on thousands of patients, usually through three rounds of studies lasting roughly seven years total. Counting initial cell and animal studies, and regulatory review at the end, the process easily takes a decade and more than $1 billion.But for rare diseases, the drugs are tested on much smaller groups, sometimes just a few hundred or few dozen. And patient testing can wrap up a couple of years sooner. That, plus government financial incentives, can cut development costs by one-third to one-half, and approval is nearly assured.Big drugmakers do not disclose how much they invest in rare diseases. The returns can be huge, though.Pfizer Inc. made $3.53 billion last year selling rare-disease treatments, not counting its 10 cancer drugs for patients with specific genetic mutations. By 2019, 34 rare-disease drugs could have annual sales exceeding $1 billion each, according to a forecast by research firm GlobalData.Other companies leading in the rare-disease field include Baxter International Inc., Bayer Corp., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Celgene Corp., Novartis AG and Novo Nordisk A/S.One financial model for rare diseases is the groundbreaking 'venture philanthropy' pioneered by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, which funded early research on four key medicines for the genetic disease. Those drugs and better care raised average life expectancy from 10 years in the 1960s to 41 today.Over the years, the foundation raised millions through walkathons, gala dinners, golf tournaments and the like. With drug companies still not biting, it turned to paying for specific research projects.Since 2000, the foundation has committed $150 million to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., which spent 11 years screening 200,000 possibilities to find the best drug to test. The result was Kalydeco, approved in 2012 for 1,650 patients with a specific mutation.Kalydeco is the first drug to target the cause, not just symptoms, of cystic fibrosis, which causes sticky mucus to clog the lungs, triggering frequent infections and other complications. Kalydeco slows the disease's progression and eases breathing. Its list price is $311,000 a year, but Vertex says most patients pay $50 per month.In December, the foundation sold its royalty rights on Kalydeco and other treatments developed by Vertex for $3.3 billion to speed up new research by Vertex, Pfizer and others. A second drug awaits approval, and Vertex is developing others. The company hopes to have treatments for roughly 90 percent of patients by around 2020.Meanwhile, patients and their families are seeking help and money by telling their stories on social media. One of the best-known fundraising efforts was last year's Ice Bucket Challenge, in which people around the world doused themselves with ice water, raising $115 million for the ALS Association.Glenn and Cara O'Neill started the Cure Sanfilippo Foundation to save daughter Eliza, now 5. The disease kills brain cells, causing hyperactivity and autistic-like behavior, then seizures. Patients eventually lose the ability to walk, speak and eat and usually die by their teens.The Columbia, South Carolina, couple tried charity events to fund research, but amassed only $250,000 in five months. They knew they needed millions.So they got volunteers to make an emotional video of Eliza and started a GoFundMe campaign. The video, posted at www.CureSFF.org, went viral and raised $2.2 million in eight months.Now the O'Neills are working with a children's hospital and a biotech firm to test a potential gene therapy, though manufacturing difficulties have delayed patient testing. The parents hope the therapy shows enough promise to attract a well-off drugmaker that can fund larger studies needed for approval.'If it works in humans as well as it does in mice, it'll be incredible,' O'Neill said. 'It's Eliza's only chance, but we are nearly out of time.'Laurie Eallonardo of Torrance, California, faced similar fears when one of her twins, Jenna, started having hundreds of seizures daily at five months and stopped laughing, smiling and interacting with her.A doctor misdiagnosed Jenna's condition, wasting months on an ineffective treatment. Then Children's Hospital of Los Angeles doctors diagnosed infantile spasms, which often cause autism and mental disabilities.Jenna got the only approved treatment, adrenocorticotropic hormone costing $125,000 over 2½ months. The cost was partly covered by the National Organization for Rare Disorders.'We knew within five days it worked,' Eallonardo recalls.Jenna did not talk until she was 2½, but with years of medication and therapy, overcame developmental delays. She's now an outgoing first-grader starring in her school play.'She's ahead in spelling and reading,' beams her mother. 'I'm in tears when I see her play or speak.'___Follow Linda A.

telegraph,15/04/2004 00:01,finance,"Two biotechnology firms linked to science and innovation minister Lord Sainsbury of Turville are facing serious financial difficulties, it emerged yesterday.          Diatech Limited, which holds several patents for techniques which could be useful to the genetically modified food industry, has gone into liquidation, while biotechnology investment firm Innotech is making huge losses.          Filings lodged at Companies House show that Diatech entered voluntary liquidation November 2003.          Innotech Investments is still trading but its most recently  accounts, for 2002, reveal that it made a pre-tax loss of £7.4m compared with a loss of £4.1m the previous year.          They show that the company currently has net debt of £48m compared with shareholders' funds of just £20.7m and that the company saw a net cash outflow of £1.4m in 2002.          Innotech's net asset value per share, a measure of how the company's investments have performed, tumbled to £1.24 from £2.72.          During that year, the company was propped up with £25m of financing from the blind trust set up to oversee Lord Sainsbury's financial interests when he became a minister.          The company's accounts show that the trust has provided the company with £62m in financing over the past three years.          Lord Sainsbury, who receives no ministerial salary, is a strong supporter of GM technology and his interests in Innotech and Diatech have proved highly controversial.          Innotech has a stake in the US-based Paradigm Genetics, which has close links to Monsanto, the controversial GM food company.          He is also responsible for Britain's biotechnology industry. However, he has always said that he has absented himself from government meetings on GM and plays no formal role in policymaking.          Despite his financial interests being controlled by the trust, over which he has no control, the minister has faced repeated attacks from opposition MPs who have voiced concerns over potential conflicts of interest.          In addition to his biotechnology interests, Lord Sainsbury is a member of the Sainsbury retailing family, which controls 38pc of the supermarket group's shares.          He owns two properties in Westminster which are currently used as offices and an adjacent residential property next door which is unoccupied. His wife owns a house in Stratford-upon-Avon and has a partnership in a nursery school.          Judith Portrait, the trustee for the blind trust, said: 'Lord Sainsbury was required, under the ministerial code, to transfer all his investments into the blind trust when he was appointed a minister.          'The whole purpose of the blind trust is that the minister cannot know anything about his investments or assets and I, therefore, cannot comment because to do so would unblind the trust and defeat its very purpose.'          A spokesman for the Department of Trade & Industry said: 'His assets are in a blind trust. He has no knowledge of it and no control over it.' Lord Sainsbury was said to be on holiday yesterday."
telegraph,14/04/2005 00:01,finance,"Two British biotechnology companies gained a cash injection in one of the biggest-ever deals in the European sector yesterday when Swiss drugmaker Novartis took on an experimental treatment for smoker's lung.          Recently floated Vectura, and privately-owned Arakis, said that Novartis had agreed to develop and commercialise their AD 237 drug for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) which is primarily caused by smoking. The deal is expected to hasten Arakis' road towards flotation.          Each company will receive an initial $15m and could get up to a further $172.5m if the drug achieves its objectives. The two companies would also get a level of royalties on sales, which analysts estimate at between 10pc and 15pc.          Novartis will develop AD 237 both on its own and with a Novartis-owned product. This, Vectura's chief executive Chris Blackwell said, would give the company more protection from the problems that sometimes hit biotechnology companies when their products are abruptly dropped by big pharmaceutical businesses.           Sam Fazeli, analyst at Nomura, called it a 'transforming deal for both Vectura and Arakis'.          Sir Chris Evans, the biotechnology entrepreneur who founded both Arakis and Vectura, said the deal was part of a pick-up in the biotechnology market.           'There is a new wave of companies coming through to replace the ones that had gone,' he said. 'These were my babies. I put money into both of them at the beginning.'          He said it was too early for the current climate of fear over drug safety to affect biotechnology companies, because many of the problems only became evident when products are being prescribed to large numbers of patients.           It was vital that biotech companies should structure their clinical trials as well as possible. 'Biotech has got to have a good look and do things properly,' he said.          Vectura shares rose 5½ to 81½p yesterday."
telegraph,29/05/2006 00:01,comment,"University strike action would have dramatic consequences         Sir - While I entirely agree with your call to 'Free the universities' (Leader, May 27), I have to say that you are sorely misinformed about academic contracts and work. Most importantly, our work has not 'risen with the great increase in the number of students' we teach: it has risen with the expansion of the university bureaucracy to Stalinist proportions (and with a mindset to match).          I wish our unions had the nerve to call a strike on that issue - this is, after all, destroying the very nature of our jobs, and of higher education.                      Dr Heinrich Härke, Earley, Berks          Sir - Your leading article makes the admirable suggestion that universities should be set free to pay lecturers what they are worth. However, this proposal will find little sympathy in common rooms across Britain.          Lecturers know full well what the job prospects are for graduates in media studies and computer science. They know that after graduation, many of their students would kill to get their jobs - even at half the salary.          Yet setting our universities free would certainly be a good thing. The Government regards higher education as an industry, and it is becoming just as shoddy as any other nationalised industry. Educators are selling their wares with blatantly false promises of lucrative careers in 'creative' occupations. If they were selling insurance or pensions, many of our dons would have been locked up by now.                      Tom Burkard, Norwich          Sir - I find it hard to believe that lecturers can be so selfish as to take industrial action.          The students affected may not get the degree class they were going to get, or get their degree at all. This will have severe consequences for their careers and further training prospects, especially where these are contingent on their grades or degree class this summer.          The lecturers have gainful employment for better pay than in a lower-skilled and lower-paid jobs. Their careers are - at least on the face of it - in full swing. University students affected by these strikes are just starting out in life. Getting started in the world of work is difficult enough, even for those with a degree. While they are entitled to take industrial action, engaging in action that jeopardises other people's futures is not the way to do it.                      Steven Crake, Shrewsbury          Sir - I am a finalist facing the prospect of a degree ceremony without a degree classification. The vice-chancellors, the media and the Government must take some action now. This situation has been going on for long enough and is now about to affect very real lives.                      Rachel Cooper, Burton-on-Trent, Derbys          Genome way to go         Sir - So Craig Venter has sequenced his own DNA, beginning to end (report, May 26). We now know that he has a lot of money, a massive capacity for self-publicity, and considerable technical skill. Fascinating stuff, but we knew it all without his genome. Because, apart from very rare odds and ends, his complete genome tells us mercifully little about the essential Dr Venter. That is because science still does not know much about what most genes do, how they interact with each other and with environmental factors, and therefore how they influence what we become.           That knowledge will take many more years to gather, in part through studies such as the UK Biobank which collects long-term information on people's health and exposure to environmental agents as well as their genetic variation. Venter rubbished that study, too.                       Martin Bobrow, Emeritus Professor of Medical Genetics University of Cambridge           Don't scrap the scrum          Sir - Playing prop forward for Oundle School 45 years ago at the age of 17, I suffered damage resulting in admission to the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital Stanmore, a bone graft to my lower back and the loss of two discs. I spent three months in a head-to-toe plaster cast, a further month in hospital, then six months wearing a steel corset. My school career ended prematurely, my A-level courses had to be abandoned and my sporting activities were severely curtailed.          Should the scrum be abolished in its present form (report, May 26)? No: it is an essential part of a fine game. The number of accidents strikes me as minimal in relation to the popularity of rugby. In any case, surgical procedures are thankfully now much improved.          If the rugby scrum is seen as too risky, then what about other 'dangerous' sports? A visit to the local point-to-point horse races reveals the large number of people reduced to a wheelchair by riding accidents; a visit to the ski slopes evidences the high risk of injury from that splendid sport.                      Crombie Glennie, Hawksworth, Notts           Method in the mayhem          Sir - I agree with Andrew Gimson's analogies (Comment, May 26). Recent acts by the Home Office are born of desperation. However, they have been employed so often that they are now blindingly transparent.           It is my theory that Tony Blair thrives on chaos and administrative disasters because without them there would be nothing to legislate on, nothing to 'reform'.           A period of rest is needed after the blizzard of initiatives that has harassed the Home Office and every other department in portfolio.          When will it come?                      Peter Goves, London W12         Humility is becoming          Sir - In the recent Royal Society statement on evolution, some remarks are made, almost in passing, on the theory of intelligent design.           As with remarks on creationism and evolution itself, there is a definite attempt to disparage anything that does not fall within the parameters of mainline Darwinian thinking. There are plenty of open-minded theists who, while not wanting to be classed with red-neck fundamentalists, find more than a whiff of something interesting in teleology.           Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking, scholars with liberal street cred, both engage seriously and sympathetically with issues such as 'fine tuning' and the anthropic argument. Intelligent design itself can be seen as a perfectly legitimate offshoot of the classic design argument first set out by Plato in the Timaeus.           It would be helpful to continuing debate, therefore, if all sides refrained from too rapid a demonisation of their opponents. There is plenty of truth to be found in traditional scholarship, and a certain humility is becoming for all who seek to probe the mysteries of creation.                      Rev Andrew McLuskey, Staines, Surrey          Bad taste          Sir - Cherie Blair has no idea of the offence she has caused by signing the Hutton report (report, May 27). I can only compare it to a pseudo-celebrity signing the coroner's report of a death in the family, so it can be auctioned for money.                      Jeremy Clark, Caythorpe, Lincs          Doing time out          Sir - Your report ('Prison with a holiday camp regime', May 27) came as no surprise. A friend who was a prison officer at a notorious jail resigned in disgust at what he saw. The only discipline enforced at the jail was on the prison warders; the convicts were at liberty to do as they pleased. He left when he realised that they had more recreational facilities at their disposal than he did on his annual holiday at Butlins.

I was on an Army exercise in Germany at the end of the 1990s. In the bar, a Scottish signals squadron had seized control of the TV to watch Scotland v Germany. Every German goal was cheered by the English squadrons.                       Adrian Tear, Romford, Essex          Essex girl          Sir - It is fitting that Boadicea is charging the Houses of Parliament (Letters, May 27): independent, strong-willed Essex folk rising up against an oppressive, pan-European political elite.                      Douglas Carswell MP, Clacton-on-Sea, Essex           Five-ring circus          Sir - Before he is accused of being an old killjoy, I write to support Prince Philip in his views on Olympic ceremonies (report, May 27). They have become an international competition of profligacy that we certainly cannot afford.          We should re-set the tone with a more low-key and dignified event emphasising Olympic athletic prowess above shameless extravaganza.                      Michael Hutchinson Meonstoke, Hants          Make it snappy          Sir - Given the current fad for eating crocodile meat (report, May 26), culinary novices should be aware that it does not, in fact, taste like chicken. It tastes like alligator.                      John Miller Orpington, Kent          Bring back the gilded dragons         Sir - It is good news that the pagoda in Kew Gardens has been reopened to the public (report, May 26).           How extraordinary it must have looked in the 18th century when, beside the pagoda, amid the groves, stood the 'Alhambra' and mosque that, thanks to George III, William Chambers also built. It is sad that they were demolished in the 19th century. We think ourselves enlightened today and careful of our heritage, so would it not prove popular if the 80 gilded dragons and the brightly coloured roofs that once adorned Chambers's spirited structure were restored?                      Mary Leslie, Jarrow, Newcastle         Our future lies in research investment         Sir - Sir John Rose asks how we can compete with India and China, which produce hundreds of thousands of science and engineering graduates (Money, May 24). His analysis hits the nail on the head. Investment in research is the key to our future.          We must, above all, strive to maintain the areas in which we currently excel. Medical research is one. Recent figures from the Office of Science and Innovation show that the UK now leads the G8 group of industrialised nations, even the US, in the productivity of biomedical and pre-clinical research. But brilliance in research and academic publication are not enough.          Britain is often caricatured as making scientific breakthroughs that others turn into products and profits. That is changing. The pharmaceutical industry invests hugely in research and development in this country, and biotechnology is better developed and more successful here than anywhere else in Europe.          Multinational companies in these areas choose the UK for their own research because of the strength of publicly funded research. They benefit from the flow of well-trained young scientists and collaboration with leading academic researchers. And, increasingly they work with the relevant research councils, health departments and medical charities in a coordinated approach to innovation, wealth creation and health benefit.          Scientists at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of monoclonal antibodies. But they didn't leave the translation into products to other countries. Sir Gregory Winter, also at LMB, developed the methods for making antibodies into effective drugs.          The resulting spin-out company, Cambridge Antibody Technology, is a UK success story. This sequence of discovery, translation and exploitation has led to the new generation of biological drugs, including Herceptin, Avastin and Humira.          There are many lessons from this story. The arms-length management of research councils, independent of ministerial control, has been the key to building a strong science base. Investment in research can take many decades to yield economic benefits. And it is important to recognise that benefits to the quality of life are as important as those to the economy.

telegraph,3/11/2012 8:00,news,"Vigorous daily exercise could repair damage caused by a heart attack, a new study has suggested.Researchers found for the first time that regular and strenuous exercise can   make dormant stem cells in the heart spring into life, leading to the   development of new heart muscle. Scientists had already discovered that stem cells could be coaxed into   producing new tissue through injections of chemicals known as growth   factors, but the new study is the first to suggest that a simple exercise   programme has a similar effect. The findings suggest that damage from heart disease or failure could be at   least partially repaired through 30 minutes of running or cycling a day, at   enough intensity to work up a sweat. An early-stage study on healthy rats showed that an equivalent amount of   exercise resulted in more than 60 per cent of heart stem cells, which are   usually dormant in adults, becoming active. After two weeks of exercise the mice had a seven per cent increase in the   number of cardiomyocites, the 'beating' cells in heart tissue,   researchers reported in the European Heart Journal. The team from Liverpool John Moores University said they would now study the   effects on mice which had suffered heart attacks to determine whether it   could have an even greater benefit. Dr Georgina Ellison, who led the study, said: 'The exercise is increasing   the growth factors which are activating the stem cells to go on and repair   the heart, and this is the first time that this potential has been shown. 'We hope it might be even more effective in damaged hearts because you   have got more reason to replace the large amount of cells that are lost.'Although some patients with severe heart damage may not be capable of   intensive exercise, Dr Ellison said a significant number would easily be   able to jog or cycle for 30 minutes a day without risking their health. 'In a normal cardiac rehabilitation programme patients do undertake   exercise, but what we are saying is maybe to be more effective it needs to   be carried out at a higher intensity, in order to activate the resident stem   cells,' she said. Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director of the British Heart   Foundation, which funded the research, said: 'This study adds to the   growing evidence that adult hearts may be able to make new muscle from   dormant stem cells. 'However, much more research is now needed to find out whether what’s   been seen in this study can be translated into treatments for human   patients.”"
telegraph,7/11/2013 0:01,news,"Volunteers for a new 'open access' project could help the advancement of science – but also risk discovering how their genome might raise the risk of incurable diseases Up to 100,000 British volunteers are being asked to publish their genetic code   online in the name of scientific research, despite the risk of discovering   they have the biological triggers for incurable diseases like Huntington’s   or Alzheimer’s. The Personal Genome   Project UK (PGP-UK) is aimed at building a trove of genetic and health   information, which can be accessed by researchers, drug companies, or anyone   with an internet connection. Scientists hope that sequencing the full genomes of volunteers and making them   free to access can help speed up the drive for new treatments in areas such   as cancer, diabetes and dementia. Paired with information about their health and other traits, the data could   help scientists learn how genetic and environmental factors drive disease,   and why medicines affect people differently. But those taking part also risk the terrifying prospect of learning that they   are at high risk of conditions such as Huntington's disease, for which there   is a well-known genetic cause but no cure. Researchers insist their data will not be up to a medical standard – meaning   any concerning results would have to be retested by a doctor before being   confirmed. But anyone volunteering will be warned about a host of 'scary'   scenarios that could occur, including the risk of discovering genes linked   to diseases such as Huntington's or Alzheimer's. Although the data will be anonymised, they accept that it could be possible   for volunteers' identities to be discovered, and once published online their   information would be impossible to permanently erase from the internet. Volunteers are also encouraged to consider scenarios which could be possible   in the future, such as the risk of having their DNA planted at a crime   scene, or even of being cloned without their permission. The ethical and psychological risks are such that all participants must   complete a test proving that they understand the potential ramifications   before signing the 19-page consent form. But researchers revealed that they have already been approached by 450 willing   volunteers, despite the fact the project did not launch in Britain until   today. It follows a US version, which launched in 2005, and a Canadian branch which   began last year. Prof Stephan Beck, one of the UK project leaders from University College   London, said: 'Donating your genome and health data to science is a   great way to enable advances in the understanding of human genetics, biology   and health.  'This project is important for a number of reasons. It will establish   the practice of open consent in the UK and enable medical advancement   through meeting science's need for richer data.' Anyone taking part will donate saliva and skin or blood samples, and in return   receive a report detailing any significant findings linked to disease,   whether they are treatable or not. The report will be updated each year if findings change in light of new   scientific discoveries. A total of 25,000 human genomes have been sequenced around the world in   various projects, but just a fraction are available to the public and only   four per cent of volunteers concerned have access to their own data. Sharmila Nebhrajani, chief executive of the Association of Medical Research   Charities, said the project was an 'exciting initiative' but also   a 'real ethical challenge'.  'Those who do decide to make their genomic data available on an open   source basis, such as the PGP, should understand the implications of that   decision,' she said.  'That the data revealed is a permanent marker of them as individuals and   indeed not only of them but also of their families; that the genomic data   may show the presence of late onset diseases that have yet to manifest   themselves.'

dailymail,23/04/2015 08:16,wires,"WASHINGTON (AP) — New technologies account for one way that the government is tracking a life-threatening outbreak of listeria linked to Blue Bell ice cream products.Texas-based Blue Bell Creameries recalled all its products this week after listeria was found in a variety of the company's frozen treats. The massive recall followed several smaller recalls as health officials across the country rapidly worked to track the outbreak, which is linked so far to 10 listeria illnesses in four states, including three deaths.The investigation has been helped by technology called whole genome sequencing, which maps all an organism's DNA. While the sequencing has been a staple of medical research, it has only recently been used regularly to track listeria outbreaks. With help from that technique, federal and state officials realized the outbreak was not just a recent event — the ice cream had likely made people sick since 2010.Questions consumers may have about the outbreak and how it's tracked:___WHAT IS LISTERIA?Listeria is a hardy bacteria found in soil and water that can be tracked into a plant or carried by animals. It can be very difficult to get rid of once it contaminates a processing facility, partly because it grows well in refrigeration. It is commonly found in processed meats, unpasteurized cheeses and unpasteurized milk, and it is sometimes found in other foods as well — listeria in cantaloupes was linked to 30 deaths in a 2011 outbreak.___WHAT HAS BEEN RECALLED?As of Monday, Blue Bell ice cream has recalled all of its products. That follows more limited recalls of Blue Bell products made on production lines in Texas and Oklahoma after the ice cream was linked to deaths and illnesses in Kansas and Texas. The company issued Monday's recall after two samples of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream tested positive for listeria.___HOW DID THEY LINK THE ILLNESSES TO THE ICE CREAM?The first indication of listeria contamination in Blue Bell products came in January, when the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control collected samples from a Blue Bell distribution plant as part of a random sampling program. The South Carolina officials had no reason to suspect the ice cream was contaminated, but they found that two of Blue Bell's products contained high amounts of listeria. South Carolina notified the Food and Drug Administration, which began an investigation that led to Monday's massive recall.___WHAT ELSE DID THEY FIND?Testing in Texas and Kansas found more contaminated samples that could be linked to illnesses in those states. The CDC also found past cases of listeria illnesses that could be linked to the Blue Bell products using whole genome sequencing.___WHAT IS WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING?Whole genome sequencing maps all an organism's DNA, instead of just part of it, as other tests do. Dr. Robert Tauxe of the CDC says it has enabled health officials to get better results when trying to link a person's listeria illness to a particular food. Government investigators take stool or blood samples from patients and use the tests to link them to strains of the pathogen — listeria in this case — found in the food.Tauxe says the whole genome sequencing gives officials hope that future outbreaks can be tracked faster and more accurately.___WHAT ARE SYMPTOMS OF LISTERIA?When a person contracts the disease, it can cause fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal symptoms and even death.___AM I AT RISK?Listeria generally only affects the elderly, people with compromised immune systems and pregnant women. It can cause miscarriage, stillbirth and premature labor for women and serious illness or death in newborn babies. Healthy, younger adults and most children can consume listeria with no ill effects or only mild illness.___HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?State and federal inspectors are still investigating the outbreak and have not released a cause. In past outbreaks, contamination has been the result of dirty equipment or unsanitary conditions in a plant.Blue Bell says it is expanding its cleaning and sanitization system, beefing up its employee training, expanding its swabbing system by 800 percent to include more surfaces and sending daily samples to a microbiology laboratory for testing. The 108-year-old company said it will also test all products produced at its facilities before sending them to retailers.___Find Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick"
dailymail,1/4/2015 19:12,wires,"WASHINGTON (AP) — With recent government approval of potatoes that don't bruise and apples that don't brown, a new generation of genetically modified foods is headed to grocery shelves.What could be next? Cancer-fighting pink pineapples, heart-healthy purple tomatoes and less fatty vegetable oils, among other products, could receive government approval in the coming years.The companies and scientists that have created these foods are hoping that customers will be attracted to the health benefits and convenience and overlook any concerns about genetic engineering.'I think once people see more of the benefits they will become more accepting of the technology,' says Michael Firko, who oversees the Agriculture Department's regulation of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs.Critics aren't so sure. They say there should be more thorough regulation of modified foods, which are grown from seeds engineered in labs. The Agriculture Department has the authority only to oversee plant health relative to GMOs, and seeking Food and Drug Administration's safety approval is generally voluntary.'Many of these things can be done through traditional breeding,' says Doug Gurian-Sherman of the advocacy group Center for Food Safety. 'There needs to be skepticism.'Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. has engineered a pink pineapple that includes lycopene, an antioxidant compound that gives tomatoes their red color and may have a role in preventing cancer. USDA has approved importation of the pineapple, which would be grown only outside of the United States; it is pending FDA approval. Some gardeners already grow conventional purple tomatoes, but a small British company is planning to apply for U.S. permission to produce and sell a new genetically modified variety that have high levels of anthocyanins, compounds found in blueberries that some studies show lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. FDA would have to approve any health claims used to sell the products.Seed giants Monsanto and Dow AgroSciences are separately developing modified soybean, canola and sunflower oils with fewer saturated fats and more Omega-3 fatty acids. The Florida citrus company Southern Gardens is using a spinach gene to develop genetically engineered orange trees that could potentially resist citrus greening disease, which is devastating the Florida orange crop. Okanagan Specialty Fruits Inc., the company that created the nonbrowning apples, is also looking at genetically engineering peaches, cherries and pears to resist disease and improve quality.A few genetically engineered fruits and vegetables are already available in grocery stores: Hawaiian papaya, some zucchini and squash and a small amount of the sweet corn we eat, for example. But the bulk of the nation's genetically engineered crops are corn and soybeans that are eaten by livestock or made into popular processed food ingredients like corn starch, soybean oil or high fructose corn syrup.The engineered corn and soybeans have faced resistance from environmental groups and some consumers who say not enough is known about the technology. The FDA has said engineered foods on the market now are safe, but the groups have called for the labeling so consumers know what they are eating.  According to a December Associated Press-GfK poll, two-thirds of Americans favor those labels.Facing that concern, companies developing the new products say their strategy for winning over consumers is to harness the increased interest in healthy eating.'This is a new wave of crops that have both grower benefits and consumer benefits,' says Doug Cole of J.R. Simplot, the company that developed the potatoes. Many modified types of corn and soybeans are engineered to resist herbicides, which is of little use to the consumer.A potential benefit of Simplot's potatoes is fewer black spots, a plus not only for farmers seeking higher yields but also for consumers who wouldn't have to soak them before cooking. Small amounts of both the potatoes and the apples could be in stores in the next two or three years.British scientist Cathie Martin has developed the modified purple tomatoes and hopes to eventually sell them as a juice in the United States. She says some of those same health-conscious consumers concerned about GMOs should be attracted to a product with potential to help lower the risk of cancer.Retailers are still uncertain. McDonald's buys Simplot's conventional potato products but said the company does not have 'current plans' to source any GMO potatoes. Other retail chains have already pledged not to sell a genetically engineered salmon that is pending approval at the Food and Drug Administration.Cathleen Enright of the Biotechnology Industry Organization says the industry worries that opposition from advocacy groups will slow development.'At the end of the day, the marketplace is going to determine what is going to succeed,' Enright said.___Find Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick"
telegraph,22/06/2003 00:01,comment,"We have to look at the benefit for the embryo,' a spokesman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) said last week, explaining the Authority's decision not to allow the pre-implantation screening of embryos. Michelle and Jayson Whitaker had appplied to the HFEA for permission to use that procedure. Their son Charlie has a rare form of anaemia which will kill him in early adolescence if not treated.The only treatment involves transplanting stem cells into his body from someone of an identical tissue type. The best way to obtain such cells is for doctors to screen embryos created by Charlie's parents, and to identify the one which has the best chance of being the closest match to his cell type. The chosen embryo would then be implanted into the mother's womb. When the baby is born, the stems cells to be used in treating anaemia can be taken from the umbilical cord.That is what has happened in the Whitakers' case, although they had to go to Chicago for their pre-implantation screening. The HFEA's refusal to allow the procedure to take place in Britain is not easy to understand, especially since embryo selection is a standard feature of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), a technique which has resulted in the birth of nearly a million children since it was first successfully performed more than 20 years ago.Weirdly, the HFEA has also ruled that there is a 'benefit to the embryo' in being screened when the result of the screening is to ascertain whether the embryo would grow into a child which had a handicap or chronic illness. If that would be the case, then the HFEA has decided that it would be appropriate to 'screen it out' - that is to kill the embryo.There is a certain baroque unreality to the HFEA's insistence on the importance of a 'benefit to the embryo', not least because the HFEA evidently does not regard continuing to stay alive as a benefit to someone who will be born with a handicap. The HFEA's view is in sharp contrast to the way most handicapped people see their own lives. We doubt if anyone from the HFEA has ever encountered a handicapped person who believes it would have been in his or her interests not to have been born at all.There is also a grotesque irony in insisting on the critical importance of protecting the interests of one-day-old embryos - entities which may contain fewer than a dozen cells, and which are microscopically small - at a time when there are more than 187,000 abortions every year in Britain. A concern with the interests of embryos invisible to the naked eye appears hypocritical in a country where abortions are legally performed up to 28 weeks after conception, and even up till birth when doctors suspect that the baby may be born with severe handicaps.The HFEA insists that it prohibits pre-implantation screening because it might be 'psychologically damaging' for a child to discover that it was born in order to help its sibling. Yet whether a child will be happy is demonstrably unrelated to the motives of its parents at the moment of conception. What is important is that the child should be, and feel, loved - and that is just as likely (or unlikely) to be true whether or not the child's embryo was pre-selected before being implanted in the womb. The HFEA is using a purely hypothetical risk not only to ensure that children with curable diseases die from them, but to prevent the babies which could save those sick children from being being born.The HFEA's 'reasons' for preventing pre-implantation screening of embryos seem to be a way to evade the real issue which the technique raises: the creation of babies for the harvesting of body parts. It may not be long before fathers or mothers need stem cells from their children to treat their own conditions - Parkinson's disease, for example, is one candidate for stem cell therapy. It may also turn out that transfer of stem cells cannot take place without serious risk of physical harm to any child created for the purpose. We take it that the creation of babies solely for the medical benefit of adults should not be permissible. It is not, however, easy to frame a law which will permit pre-implantation screening for embryos while always prohibiting any slide on the downward slope towards organ-farming. As the passing of the 1967 Termination of Pregnancy Act showed, that downward slope can be very slippery. When opponents of the Act claimed that it would lead to abortion being used as a form of contraception, they were derided as 'fantasists' and 'scare-mongers'. Yet that is precisely what has happened.The reasons which the HFEA has given for insisting on prohibiting pre-implantation screening strike us as fatuous. For the time being, however, the prohibition itself makes good sense. It is not and cannot be an absolute prohibition on the freedom of parents to take advantage of pre-implantation screening overseas - but it at least prevents the passing of a law here which might end up being used to licence horrors which all but medical Dr Strangeloves are eager to prevent."
telegraph,27/06/2000 00:00,news,"WHEN Hollywood comes to rewrite the history of the genome, screenwriters will be hard pressed to come up with two better rivals in the race to read the code than Craig Venter and John Sulston.                               Poles apart: John Sulston [left] and Craig Venter.          One is a Vietnam veteran, a former high school drop-out turned ruthless billionaire with a taste for fast living and fine cars. The other is a vicar's son, a former hippie and peace campaigner with a social conscience and a taste for runner beans and sandals.In almost every way Venter, the maverick American head of the profit-seeking Celera, and Sulston, the British head of the Sanger Centre in Cambridge, are opposites. Both were children of the Sixties but each personifies a different facet of that decade.Venter, 54, is brash and aggressive. He dropped out of school to enjoy the surf and sun of southern California in the mid-Sixties but found himself drafted into Vietnam. Sulston, 57, is quiet and understated. He went to Cambridge and then California in the wake of the summer of love and discovered the peace movement.For Venter, his time as a medic, tending the dying and injured in the Tet Offensive, changed his life. He pledged to return to his studies and never to let the grass grow under his feet. Today his motto is 'speed matters - discovery can't wait'.Sulston on the other hand, became committed to public research and rigorous science. He spent the best part of 30 years studying a worm one millimetre long. The Guardian-reading grower of runner beans has retained a Left-wing idealism.During the Seventies neither of the men's careers were spectacular. Venter went back to college, trained as a doctor and began teaching at the State University of New York. Sulston had returned from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, at the end of the Sixties and moved to the Medical Research Council, studying the nematode worm.In the Eighties, Venter joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Washington. He began to recognise the potential of decoding gene sequences but was increasingly frustrated by the slowness of the research.As Sulston continued his slow, rigorous and thorough work, at one point spending 18 months watching his worms hatch in a small room, Venter sought ways to speed up his work. In 1987 he ordered his first automated gene sequencer and worked closely with its manufacturer, Applied Biosystems, to test and improve it.In the late Eighties he made his first major contribution to genetics. Instead of painstakingly examining long chains of DNA, he developed a crude but effective short cut, looking at the messenger molecule, RNA. James Watson, the discoverer of DNA's structure, was later dismissive of the work, claiming that 'any monkey' could do it. But it was effective.But by the time Sulston published his gene map of the nematode in 1990, Venter was getting fed up. Frustrated with the public sector, he left NIH in 1992 and set up the private Institute for Genomic Research. Three years later he unveiled the first complete genome of an organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a cause of ear infections and meningitis.He won his fully fledged maverick status in 1998 with the formation of Celera Genomics, based in Rockville, Maryland. His plan to decode the entire genome in three years for profit sent shockwaves through the academic world.Today, while Venter travels the globe in jets and Jaguars, Sulston prefers his secondhand car. Sulston describes himself as 'more of an artisan than an intellectual'. He believes sequencing for profit is immoral and is unhappy with the way companies are patenting genes.Venter is known to his many critics as Darth Venter. He is dismissive of the public sector approach. The rivalry between the two has been acrimonious and bitter. But most observers believe Venter has given the human genome project a sense of urgency, forcing the public sector to sit up and speed up."
telegraph,25/02/2010 13:02,culture,"When John Crowley learnt that two of his children had a rare, terminal disease, rather than accept the apparently inevitable he embarked on a race against time to discover a cure. Now his extraordinary story has been made into a film. On the day filming starts at Clackamas River Elementary School, in the tiny   Oregon town of Estacada, it feels as if the entire population of 2,855 –   along with some of the more star-struck residents of the neighbouring towns   Damascus and Boring – has gathered at the gates. The residents of this   little logging community at the foot of Mt Hood are determined not to let   the moment pass them by: some clutch autograph books, some binoculars,   others just stand and stare, in the hope of catching a glimpse of Harrison   Ford or perhaps his co-star Brendan Fraser. Inside the school hall, filming is under way. A child actress dressed as a   mermaid speeds on to the stage in an electric wheelchair, does a graceful   figure-of-eight around a boy in an octopus suit and the poor kid who got   cast as an oyster, then breaks into a relieved smile. She stares out across   a sea of proud, applauding parents to catch the eye of Fraser, cast in the   role of her father, John Crowley.The camera zooms in on his face: Fraser is a giant of a man, 6ft 5in and built   like a quarterback, but his eyes are full of tears. 'Not much acting   required,’ he says afterwards. 'Seeing kids do stuff like that, it’s   delightful.’Cinema has a habit of asking us to believe in incredible characters. Crowley   is no exception. The hero of this new film, Extraordinary Measures, is a   brilliant businessman who, at the age of 29, learns that two of his three   infant children suffer from Pompe disease, a rare neuromuscular disorder   that will, most likely, kill them both within two years. Instead of   accepting this bleak prognosis, Crowley goes into partnership with an   eccentric, exceptional scientist, Dr Robert Stonehill (played with gruff   charm by Harrison Ford), and founds a biotech company to develop a treatment   for his children’s illness. A little over a year later, the company has hit   on a promising new therapy and is bought out by a pharmaceuticals giant.   Less than two years after that, Crowley’s children – and other Pompe   sufferers around the world – are being treated, and their symptoms brought   under control, by a drug Crowley played a role in creating.What makes this story all the more incredible is that it is true – based on   the experiences of a man Harrison Ford describes as 'the most can-do guy   you’ll ever meet’. John Crowley was born into a close-knit Irish Catholic family in Englewood,   New Jersey, in 1967. Shortly before his eighth birthday his father, a   policeman, died on duty after a faulty exhaust pipe caused his patrol car to   fill with carbon monoxide. 'Being seven years old and waking up one morning   to find your dad’s not there any more – that’s the kind of experience that   shapes you,’ Crowley says during a telephone call from New Jersey. 'That was   the first moment that really changed my life.’The next came in 1998, after Crowley (the first in his family to receive a   college education) had racked up a degree in foreign service from Georgetown   University, a law degree from Notre Dame and an MBA from Harvard, and   secured his first job as a financial consultant. By then, he had also   married his high-school sweetheart, Aileen, and they were living with their   three young children, John Jr, Megan and Patrick, in a four-bedroom ranch just outside San Francisco. Crowley still recalls, with the   stubborn clarity of a truly awful memory, the moment on the afternoon of   March 13 1998 that changed everything. A doctor informed him and Aileen that   Megan, then only 15 months old and displaying a lack of upper-body strength   that had seen her referred to a hospital for tests, suffered from Pompe, a   fatal condition that prevents the body from breaking down glycogen, leading   to muscular dystrophy and leaving the heart and other vital organs   dangerously swollen. Within days they would learn that baby Patrick, born   only a week earlier, had also inherited the genetic mutation that causes the   disease.'I didn’t know what the hell Pompe was,’ Crowley says. 'I’d never even heard   of the word. It was a classic “wait a second, this sort of thing isn’t   supposed to happen to us” moment. You go through shock, grief, denial,   anger. When we got home to Megan that night I could hardly bear to look her   in the eye. Aileen went to bed upset but quiet, holding Patrick in his   little blanket. I just got on the computer and started searching the   internet for anything I could find about the illness. I printed out a bunch of academic research   papers then went in and woke Aileen at 2am and was rambling like an idiot,   showing her this stuff. She said, “What are you talking about? What does   this mean?” And I said, “It means we’ve got hope.” And that’s when we   started to say, “OK, let’s see what we can do about this.”'I didn’t know how to make a drug,’ he continues. 'I didn’t know how to treat   a patient. But I did know – or at least thought I knew – how to write a   business plan and start a business, and that was the only shot we had at   saving our children’s lives.’In 2000 Crowley founded Novazyme with Dr William Canfield, an Oklahoma-based   biochemist whom he had met at a Pompe research conference two years earlier.   Canfield had been independently working on a radical enzyme therapy for   Pompe for a decade but, until Crowley came along, he hadn’t been granted   sufficient funding for a clinical trial.'We were a young group,’ recalls Crowley, who took out a second mortgage on   his home to help finance the new venture. 'Of the 120 people in the company   only two were over 40, and I was the 32-year-old CEO. We didn’t know what we   were doing, we just made it up as we went along. We were really good at   raising money and we worked 18, 20 hours a day, seven days a week. What we   lacked in experience we made up for in passion.’Meanwhile, Megan and Patrick continued to deteriorate. Both were confined to   wheelchairs, lost the ability to breathe without ventilators, and, in time,   their facial muscle control deteriorated to the extent that they could no   longer muster a smile. Occasionally one or other child would succumb to some   sort of crisis – a bout of pneumonia, cardiac failure – that brought them   perilously close to death. Time was running out, but rather than spending   those precious days at home with his children, Crowley was caught up in the   quest for a treatment to prolong and improve their lives.That terrible gamble paid off on August 8 2001 when Novazyme was bought for   $137.5 million – and Crowley taken on as senior vice president – by Genzyme,   the world’s third largest biotechnology giant and the company that within 18   months would have a Pompe medicine ready to treat Megan and Patrick Crowley.   Without it, they wouldn’t be alive today.'If I knew everything I know now, I don’t think I would’ve taken the   risks I took,’ Crowley says. 'I can see now that much of what we did wasn’t financially prudent or   scientifically sound. I didn’t even know, setting out on this search for a   treatment, that it would be possible to succeed. I really didn’t know. I   wanted to believe. But more than anything I just didn’t want to get years or   decades down the road and regret not having done something. I wanted to   know, for our peace of mind and the peace of mind of everybody who loved the   kids, that – even if things turned out badly – we had done everything we   could, everything humanly possible. I just did what I thought I had to do.’Geeta Anand, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, was the first to introduce   John Crowley’s remarkable story to the wider public, in a 2001 article for   the Wall Street Journal and later in The Cure, a book on which the film is   based. When Harrison Ford came across the article he spotted in it the   potential for a film script. 'It found it to be a very compelling story,’ he   says. 'I thought if we could wrestle this into the shape of a movie, we   would be bringing a story to the screen which would enrich people’s lives.’Ford, who is an executive producer of Extra­ordinary Measures as well as   acting in it, took the idea to the producers Michael Shamberg, Stacey Sher   and Carla Santos Shamberg – a team with a better track record than any in   the business for making films 'inspired by a true story’ such as Erin   Brockovich and World Trade Center. They in turn approached the Crowleys to   seek their permission.'When Hollywood started calling within a month of Geeta’s article we told them   at first, “I don’t think we’re interested in doing this,”?’ John Crowley   says. 'Michael, Stacey and Carla seemed very sincere, and they had enormous   credibility and experience, but still, I told them, “Look, if I sign my life   rights away that’s it – you can make a movie about me and say pretty much   anything you want.” It took us many, many months to get comfortable with the   idea. Like it or not, this film is how the world will know our family. And   thankfully we do like it. I think they did a very nice job.’'We like to tell true stories,’ Sher says, 'and what we’ve found in developing   them is that what actually happened is always more interesting than anything   you could make up.’ Which isn’t to say that the film remains utterly   faithful to every aspect of the Crowleys’ lives. Far from it. 'It’s a very   complicated story and we boiled it down,’ Sher admits. 'We threw out a lot   of the stuff we didn’t need.’Yet while the film compresses the true sequence of events, and dispenses with   a number of the story’s key players, the producers were adamant that a   certain level of scientific accuracy remain. 'The labs you see in the film   are set up just like real labs, all the equations shown are correct,’ Sher   says. 'We’ve all been boning up on our glycobiology.’ They even sent Ford   and the film’s Scottish director, Tom Vaughan, on a crash course in   biochemistry. 'For three hours a bunch of scientists gave Harrison and me a   big PowerPoint presentation of pure science,’ Vaughan says. 'At the end we   both just looked at each other and Harrison said, “We’re gonna do some   drinking tonight.”’Michael Shamberg explains that Vaughan, 40, was chosen for the job over a   number of more experienced directors because his 2006 University Challenge   comedy, Starter for 10, had persuaded them that he knew how to handle an   emotional story. 'The Brits are very good at keeping things from being   sentimental,’ he says. 'They give you feeling without being sappy about it.’Perhaps the greatest liberty the filmmakers took – other than casting the 6ft   5in Fraser to play the 5ft 6in Crowley – was in the creation of Dr Robert   Stonehill, the pig-headed but ultimately big-hearted researcher played by   Harrison Ford. Ford describes the character as 'a composite of a number of   different scientists who played a part in the real story’. A crew member on set puts it more bluntly: 'He is an amalgam of every   scientist asshole who tried to stop Crowley saving his kids.’ In any case,   Stonehill’s stubbornness and initial reluctance to respond to the urgency of   Crowley’s plight conveys successfully that the road to the treatment was far   from smooth.'Biotech is two steps forward one step back every day,’ Crowley says. 'If   things were going great it was a complete high. I felt totally elated   because not only were my job and my career and my potential financial future   looking better, but I was also coming that much closer to saving Megan and   Patrick. So the highs were higher than in any job you could possibly have.   But equally the lows were about as low as you could get.’Crowley pinpoints the lowest point in the whole endeavour as a particularly   dark period, in the second half of 2002, when Genzyme’s new treatment   started undergoing clinical trials but he couldn’t find a way of getting his   own children on to any of them. The company’s board had decided that, with   the medication in extremely short supply, the initial trial would be carried   out only on patients younger than a year old, who would require the smallest   doses. A second trial was then instigated for children under three. Patrick   and Megan Crowley, then four and five, did not qualify for either.'I’d see scenes on television of parents of a Pompe patient in Italy   who’d chained themselves to the front of a hospital and had the bishop of   Naples show up and crowds chanting at the hospital, “We want the drug.” And   then I’d be instructed by my boss that Genzyme’s CEO had given us the   go-ahead to send the drug to these people,’ Crowley says. 'So I’d pack it up   on ice and put it in a FedEx box, and the next day on TV I’d see a motorcade   going to that same hospital to escort the medicine to save a kid’s life. Of   course, part of me was thrilled to save that little kid in Naples, but part   of me was torn apart that I couldn’t give it to Megan and Patrick.’After what seemed like an interminable wait – and following Crowley’s   resignation from Genzyme to pre-empt accusations of a conflict of interest –   Megan and Patrick were finally accepted on to a clinical trial in January   2003, becoming the 27th and 28th patients in the world to get the company’s   new enzyme therapy. They still receive it every other week, and continue to   respond well.'Their organs are now healthy – you couldn’t tell them from the organs of kid   without the disease, which is a remarkable change from seven years ago,’   Crowley says. 'In terms of skeletal muscle strength, the disease has   progressed much more slowly than it would have without the medicine, but   they’re still very fragile: still in their wheelchairs, on ventilators.’Asked what his future hopes for his children are, Crowley pauses. 'More than   anything I just want Megan and Patrick each to live as full a life as they   can,’ he says. 'We are now in uncharted territory. Kids have never lived   this long with this disease.’ As Extraordinary Measures makes clear, with its scenes of raucous birthday   parties and family outings, one of the Crowleys’ chief achievements has been   to maintain for their children as ordinary an existence as possible. Despite   their significant disabilities, both Megan and Patrick continue to attend   state school. And Megan, who has just turned 13 and according to her father   is 'totally excited about “her” movie coming out’, really did once star as a   mermaid in the end-of-year play.'On a typical morning,’ Crowley says, 'we wake up and there are the two Jack   Russells running around the house. John Jr, who has ADHD, will be tearing   about too, in need of his morning dose of Ritalin. And Megan will be   knocking chunks of plaster off the walls with her 300lb wheelchair.   Sometimes, on those mornings, you just want to bang your head against a   wall,’ he laughs. 'But sometimes, more often than not, you just step back   and say, “You know what? We’ve got another day together. And that’s OK with   me.”’'Extraordinary Measures’ is released on February 26"

But we could also … introduce bioactive compounds from other foods, such as ginseng.'He stressed the genome knife's importance as a tool that allows genetic engineers to make extremely precise mutations.'Scientists need to create designed mutations to determine the function of specific genes,' he said. 'Say we have a yeast that produces a wine with great flavour and we want to know why.'We delete one gene, then another, until the distinctive flavour is gone, and we know we have isolated the gene responsible for that characteristic.'He said the new technology also makes genetically modified organisms less objectionable.'In the past, scientists have had to use antibiotic markers to indicate the spot of genetic alteration in an organism, and many persons objected to their use in foods because of the danger of developing antibiotic resistance,' he said.'With the genome knife, we can cut the genome very precisely and efficiently so we do not have to use antibiotic markers to confirm a genetic event.'  "
dailymail,16/02/2015 23:12,health,"Women often say during pregnancy that they are 'eating for two'.But experts have warned overeating during this crucial period can increase the risk of the baby later developing health problems.Women who gain too much weight during pregnancy run the risk of giving their offspring health problems in later life, researchers found.Babies born to mothers who were overweight during their late pregnancy were more likely to develop illnesses such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke, experts said.Instead, pregnant women should ensure they lead a healthy lifestyle, with even the period just before birth being 'fundamental' to giving their children the best chance.The findings are published as part of a major European obesity project, which concluded that strategies must urgently be developed to prevent obesity in girls and in women of childbearing age.The importance of a healthy diet during pregnancy was highlighted by the project.As part of the study, researchers followed more than 13,000 people from birth in the 1930s and 40s until their present age.They found the placenta of mothers eating a high-fat diet offered weakened protection to the foetus against the stress hormone cortisol.This can mean that the growth of the foetus is reduced and these offspring are more likely to suffer mood disorders in adulthood, researchers at the University of Edinburgh found.Other key findings related to protective caps on the end of DNA which are known as telomeres.Having long telomeres protects the DNA to enable it to function and repair, while shorter telomeres are markers of disease and a shorter lifespan, scientists said.The team also discovered that obesity, combined with high weight gain during pregnancy, is associated with shorter telomere length in women's offspring and as they get older.Dr Patricia Iozzo, of the Institute of Clinical Physiology, in Pisa, Italy, who led the project, said that even if a pregnant woman was born with shorter telomeres herself and has a high body mass index (BMI) she can reverse the situation by being physically active and produce healthier children.She said: 'The project has underlined the importance of preventing obesity in pregnancy, preventing excess weight gain during pregnancy, and also maintaining healthy diet without too much fat - all of which can have short and long term effects on the health of the mother and her child.'In the context of maternal-offspring health, attention should be devoted to the prevention of overweight and obesity among young girls, representing 'tomorrow's mothers'.Targeted strategies are also needed to ensure pregnant women do not add excess weight and protect their physical and mental health, and that of their children.'Louise Silverton, director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, said women should try to be an ideal weight before they become pregnant.She said: 'This report adds more to our knowledge about the importance of the environment in which the foetus is nurtured.'After birth, women need support to develop healthy patterns of eating and exercise for themselves and their family.'For women who are overweight or obese they need support and signposting to access weight-loss services to ensure that they are an ideal weight before they embark on their next pregnancy.'The Developmental ORIgins of healthy and unhealthy AgeiNg: the role of maternal obesity (Dorian) consortium, as it was known, was funded by the European Commission’s Framework Programme. "

telegraph,13/07/2004 00:01,culture,"       James Le Fanu reviews His Brother's Keeper  by Jonathan Weiner   The brave new world of biology is in the doldrums. Ten years ago it promised to make clear all that was currently obscure. The discovery of the gene for this and the gene for that would tell us who we are, cure cancer, create perfect babies - and in the process make a fortune for the bright young scientists who possess the arcane skills to make all this happen.          Now, the biotech companies are floundering, Dolly, that triumph of genetic manipulation, is dead, her stuffed remains a museum exhibit, and the much-vaunted contributions of the new genetics to the practice of medicine is scarcely detectable.          Jonathan Weiner's His Brother's Keeper covers this period of biology's dramatic reversal of fortune and though the book will never be anything other than a curious footnote to those events, it offers - if at times unwittingly - a raft of insights into what went wrong and why.          This 'true story from the edge of medicine' concerns two brothers, the ambitious driven Jamie Heywood and his younger sibling, a laid-back carpenter, Stephen. Jamie is working for a neuroscience company when he learns that Stephen has developed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, a rapidly progressive untreatable muscular disorder similar to that which famously afflicts the astrophysicist Stephen Hawking.          By chance one of the defective genes involved in ALS had just been identified so Jamie quit his job to raise the funds for a research programme that will apply the techniques of gene therapy to 'cure his brother's incurable disease'.          Weiner himself becomes involved as a Pulitzer Prize winning science writer who sees in Jamie's mission a dramatic human-interest story from the frontiers of biology. So all seems set for a heady mix of schmaltzy sentiment ('what would you do to save your brother's life?') and utopian optimism ('now more than ever before, medicine may change human nature for ever etc etc').          But quite unexpectedly the tenor of Weiner's account changes. The dynamic go-getting Jamie emerges as one of those insufferable Type A personalities best avoided - but more interesting still are the motives of the scientists he persuades to collaborate in his scheme.          Now the principle of gene therapy is certainly very ingenious and, theoretically at least, it offers the only prospect of curing genetic disease. Technically it is immensely complex. Put simply, it would require injecting Stephen's spinal cord with a virus specially modified to carry the normal gene. This would (hopefully) infect the millions of his damaged nerve cells and in the process (hopefully) displace the dud gene that would then return their functioning to normal. It has been tried before in disease such as cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy and failed. But Jamie Heywood finds in Matt During, who runs the gene therapy centre at Philadelphia Jefferson Medical College, someone who was enthusiastic about his potential in treating ALS.          You know the enterprise is doomed, but there is still a grim fascination in Weiner's first-hand description - all the more compelling because he himself is caught up in it - as the combination of false promises, wilful self-deception and general clutching at straws gradually unravels. By the end the university has closed down Dr During's centre, Jamie's wife has left him, he has lost all his friends and the millions of dollars he has raised have evaporated.          Meanwhile Stephen is in a motorised wheelchair, scarcely able to move a muscle, speechless but able to communicate through a computerised keypad linked to a robotic voice. During the four years of his illness he has married and had a child and Weiner comments that, 'implausible as it seemed, he was happy and comfortable right where he was, it was Jamie I feared for'.          The significance of this book is that it takes place against the background of a more generalised crisis in all things genetic. It is not just that Dolly dies and everyone begins to wonder what the fuss was all about but, as Weiner is shocked to discover, most of the biologists he talks to are equally disillusioned. The director of the Rockefeller Foundation tells him that he despises 'the hype and flimflam around gene therapy and regenerative medicine'.          This poses a dilemma for writers like Weiner in their role as cheerleaders for the limitless possibilities of science. His article in The New Yorker 'Curing the Incurable: a brilliant engineer's race to save his brother's life' - written with none of the reservations and scepticism of this book - generated enormous publicity and generous contributions to the research programme. But as he subsequently remarks 'hope can be coercive'.          The future of science lies not in miracles but in a proper appreciation of the at times frustrating complexity of the problems that must be tackled. That frustration in genetics, now and for the foreseeable future, is that while medicine can pinpoint with great accuracy the nature of the defect in diseases such as ALS, the prospect of correcting it seems more insuperable than ever. Weiner has written a cautionary tale for our times.                      Dr Le Fanu's new book, 'Why are we Human? Confronting the Mysteries of Modern Biology', will be published later this year.         "
telegraph,30/03/2003 00:00,culture,"       James Le Fanu reviews Nature via Nurture by Matt Ridley   The dispute over the relative contributions of Nature (biology and, in particular, the genes) versus Nurture (the environment and, in particular, upbringing) in determining human personality and behaviour divides neatly on ideological lines - and is thus apparently no more resolvable now than it was 100 years ago. The Right favours Nature as the determining factor - exemplified by the Victorian savant Francis Galton's famous studies on the heritability of genius; the Left favours Nurture, as shown by innumerable studies on the malleability of personality - for good or ill - by circumstance.Historically both have provided a scientific rationale of a sort for a political programme whose logical consequence culminated, respectively, in fascist eugenics and communist social engineering. Confronted by two such equally unattractive options, sensible people tend to take fright and opt instead for a 'third way', with the answer lying somewhere in the middle in an interaction between Nature and Nurture.And no doubt it is a bit of both, but this foreclosing of the argument with a play on words is mere self-deception and, in particular, exonerates the nurturists (who have been very much in the ascendancy since the Second World War) from having to confront just how important in recent years Nature has turned out to be.Just how important it is has been shown, inter alia, by the remarkable observations on twins reared apart. Jim Springer and Jim Lewis, separated at birth, reunited at the age of 40, turned out to have almost identical medical histories - raised blood pressure, haemorrhoids and migraine; they both chain-smoked Salem cigarettes, followed stockcar racing and disliked baseball; they both had carpentry workshops and dogs named Toy; they both had second wives named Betty and had previously divorced first wives named Linda.Now some of these similarities were obviously mere coincidences but the two Jims spawned a series of studies in the 1980s that revealed patterns of heredity or genetic determinism that Galton could only have dreamt of. And now that the pendulum for the moment seems to be swinging decisively Nature's way, the question obviously arises as to how religiosity or carpentry or a predisposition to haemorrhoids can be transmitted through the genes from generation to generation.This surely is just the sort of question that the recently completed Human Genome Project should help illuminate and which the science writer Matt Ridley has done so much to popularise in his previous - and very successful - book, Genome. Ridley dislikes the 'third way', citing the Texan saying 'there ain't nothing in the middle of the road but a yellow line and a dead armadillo'.Personality and behaviour are of course influenced by both genes and environment but, he argues, their relative contribution is precisely the reverse of how they are usually perceived. Nurture's contribution in early childhood tends to be fixed and irreversible, while that of Nature - the genes - changes and responds to external circumstance.This heterodox and counter-intuitive view is immensely appealing for, even if Ridley is wrong, it promises along the way to shine a powerful torchlight into all those nooks and crannies of the dispute to reveal hidden facts, observations and inferences that challenge what we think we know about ourselves. Nature via Nurture opens exhilaratingly with an Olympian historical survey of those whose original ideas have influenced the debate over the past 150 years. They include, of course, Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud, but also the psychologists William James and Jean Piaget, the behaviourists B. F. Skinner and Ivan Pavlov, the sociologist Emile Durkheim and the animal behaviourist Konrad Lorenz. So, to what extent does our recently acquired knowledge of genetics illuminate their unique contributions?Consider, for example, that paragon of psychologists William James, brother of Henry, the first to point out that not only animals had instincts but humans too - and in yet greater abundance. There are the actions of babies - sucking, crying, standing and climbing; the fears and preferences of boys and girls and even the mature human emotions of sociability, modesty and love: 'Of all propensities, the sexual impulse bears the most obvious sign of being instinctive, in the sense of blind, automatic and untaught,' he wrote.There must, therefore, be some heritable factor that gives rise to physical or chemical changes in the brain that convey the emotion of falling in love - but what could it be? Well, astonishingly, there is a gene that when transferred from one species to another with a different pattern of behaviour, also transfers the propensity to form long-term attachments with a sexual partner.Now, visit, as it were, the other end of the spectrum where you would naturally think that Nurture must be determinant: the effects of physical abuse in childhood in predisposing to subsequent anti-social or violent behaviour. It does, of course, but not in all cases. Those who turn out to have a gene that expresses a specific type of brain neurotransmitter are apparently 'virtually immune to the effects of maltreatment'.Now it cannot be said that in either instance the discovery of the gene necessarily explains the particular pattern of behaviour of the love-struck or anti-social teenager, but it does show how the relationship between Nature and Nurture is much subtler and therefore much more intellectually interesting than it appears. In particular, Ridley claims, genes influence people's choice about the sort of world they create for themselves.So, at its simplest, those lucky enough to inherit a physique that allows them to be good at sport will make the most of one set of opportunities, while those with intellectual genes will seek out intellectual activities and so on. Nature thus becomes the agent of Nurture.This clever and ambitious book is full of novel insights and reflections, but it would have been better still if it had acknowledged that we don't quite yet know all the answers - and it looks increasingly as if we never will. Certainly the human genome clarifies some aspects of the forces that mould human personality and behaviour, but others become even more elusive.Thus while the remarkable similarity between the genomes of humans and their primate cousins - virtually 100 per cent - may be grist to the evolutionist's mill, it raises the embarrassing question of how to account for the genetic basis of those uniquely human attributes of language, culture, intelligence and creativity. This combined with the perplexingly small number of human genes - hardly more than an earthworm's - rather militates against genetic triumphalism, and makes one think that perhaps nurture may be the more important factor. . . and so it goes on.    James Le Fanu's new book, 'Why are we Human? Confronting the Mysteries of Modern Biology' will be published next year.  "

Take a tour of London's newest museum                              As our institutions and attractions dumb down in search of popularity - think of Kylie's hotpants at the V&A - it is exciting to find a new museum that is unashamedly 'braining up'.                                        Wellcome Collection - like Tate Modern, it modishly shuns the definite article - opened free to the public last week on the Euston Road in north London. Along with the new British Library building, the reglorified frontage of the former Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras and the arrival of Eurostar at King's Cross, it is part of the regeneration of a neighbourood.         It is also a wonderful addition to the capital's cluster of world-class museums. Combining three exhibitions, a café and bookshop, the Collection is 'very much about the connection between medicine and art and the rest of life,' according to Dr Ken Arnold, the head of public programmes.          Standing in the foyer, Dr Arnold demonstrates his point. In a glass box lies a work by the artist Marc Quinn: the figure of a woman, Silvia Petretti, who is HIV-positive. The sculpture has been cast from wax mixed with a day's dose of the drugs Silvia takes to stay alive. Nearby one of Antony Gormley's human figures hangs upside down from the ceiling.         There is, says Dr Arnold, 'a ricocheting of ideas' between the 'medicine and art' of Quinn's figure and the 'art and life' represented by the Gormley. This may sound a bit highbrow - pretentious even - but Arnold makes no bones about the complexity of his thesis. The Collection offers 'a generous, open-minded approach to medicine', embracing 'anthropology, art, history and design'. Unlike most science exhibitions, with their shiny interactiveness, it does not court the under-14s, though Arnold is quick to say they are welcome.         That it works is principally down to the startling juxtapositions of objects and concepts that cast familiar ideas in a new light. The first temporary exhibition, The Heart, celebrates the organ as the putative 'seat of the soul and the home of love' as well as the machine that pumps blood around our bodies.         In a display case fragments of papyrus show scenes from the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead in which the gods can be seen weighing the heart of a dead man against the 'feather of truth' in order to judge his suitability for the afterlife. Next to this display a sound chamber sunk into the wall plays Your cheatin' heart will tell on you by Hank Williams.         In a small dark room, a Leonardo da Vinci drawing of heart valves is shown next to a cabinet containing artificial heart valves used in surgery today. Most provocatively, an artwork combines bloody video footage of a chest cavity being sawn open, prior to heart surgery, with a recording of the evangelist Billy Graham talking of the metaphorical shedding of God's blood in the evil that men do.         One of the co-curators of The Heart, Emily Jo Sargent, indicates a space in the wall. 'We have a gap here where we're waiting for a human heart to arrive from a young woman with heart disease who has just had a heart transplant,' she says.          All this is very much in the broad-minded spirit of Sir Henry Wellcome, who died in 1936, and the charitable trust that takes his name.Wellcome was an American pharmacist and philanthropist who set up the trust to fund medical research. Its original headquarters now houses Wellcome Collection, while the trust has moved into new premises next door. The neoclassical façade of the old building is intact, but the interiors have been opened out in contemporary gallery style, with what Dr Arnold calls 'long sight-lines and a sense of transparency'.         Wellcome, who was also interested in archaeology and ethnology, was an avid collector of anything vaguely medically related. 'He collected collections rather than objects,' says Dr Arnold, and in so doing amassed 'one of the world's great museum collections'.         It is this hoard that forms the core of the permanent Wellcome Collection - though only a fraction (500 objects) of Sir Henry's entire collection of more than a million is on display.         This Medicine Man exhibition, celebrating the life and legacy of Henry Wellcome, features, inter alia, torture chairs, phantom limbs, strands of George III's hair, a 4,000-year-old trepanned skull with a finger-sized hole in it, an 18th-century metal-plated artificial nose, the death mask of Benjamin Disraeli, a shrunken head, a Peruvian mummy, Florence Nightingale's moccasins and a guillotine blade that beheaded one Jean-Baptiste Carrier during the French Revolution.         While the presentation is slick - you open discreet drawers and cupboards for background information on the exhibits - the atmosphere in Medicine Man is studiedly old-fashioned, with subdued lighting and wooden panelling to emphasise the eclectic Edwardian nature of the collection.         Next door, the third exhibition space, Medicine Now, is brash and bright in reds and whites. Here, as its title suggests, the subject is contemporary topics explored through science, art and popular culture. There are transparent and cutaway models of the human body and a giant pink sculpture by John Isaacs depicting human obesity, entitled I can't help the way I feel. If you sit on one of the white chairs facing the sculpture this will trigger a recording of an obese woman talking of her struggles with dieting.         Medicine Now also looks at genomics and genetics, which is fitting as the Wellcome Trust is the principal funder of the sequencing of the human genome in Britain. Dr Arnold points at a floor-to-ceiling bookcase of white ledgers. 'The 3.4 billion letters that constitute the human genome have been printed out in 4.5-point size and they fill 120 volumes,' he says.         I pull out one of the 1,000-page volumes, open it at random and, radically adjusting my focal length, read: 'caaacctgac...' and 'gacctggg...' and variations thereon: the secrets of the human body expounded in alphabetic terms. Revolutionary as this science is, it has an antecedent in art.         On the wall nearby are headphones in which one may hear a reading of the poem To His Mistress Going to Bed by the metaphysical poet John Donne.         This is the one where he compares his lover's body to a landscape: 'Licence my roving hands, and let them go/ Before, behind, between, above, below./ O, my America, my Newfoundland...' A wall panel explains that 'In the 21st century the Human Genome Project has mapped this land and located many of its secrets...' Ah yes, but which would you rather read, a minestrone of consonants, or Donne's sublime erotic verse? And how far does the answer to that question tell us we have come, as a species, since Donne wrote his poem 400 years ago?         Wellcome Collection, as we must call it, may make your brain hurt on occasion. But you will spill back on to the Euston Road feeling both exhilarated and ever so slightly more intelligent.         Essentials         Wellcome Collection (020 7611 2222, www.wellcomecollection.org) is at 183 Euston Road, London NW1 2BE (nearest tube stations Warren St and Euston Sq). The Heart exhibition is on till September 16. Open Tues-Sun, 10am-6pm (10pm Thurs). Admission free."
telegraph,25/01/2001 00:00,news,"     THE House of Lords voted by an unexpectedly large majority last night for legislation allowing the cloning of human embryos for medical research.                               Embryo cloning: the House of Lords voted to approve cloning on human embryos up to 14 days old          Despite an appeal from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, and other religious leaders, they approved regulations that will allow scientists to clone human embryos up to 14 days old. With peers allowed a free vote, the result had been hard to predict and ministers were immensely relieved when they won with a majority of 120.Since 1990 scientists have been able to experiment with embryos up to two weeks old for research into fertility. The Government's regulations will allowed these embryos to be used for therapeutic cloning. This involves the creation of a genetically identical embryo, from which scientists then take stem cells for research into conditions such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer and diabetes.Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, a health minister, said peers should consider the importance of this research 'to those people who shoulder the burden of these terrible diseases, their families and friends'. Lord Alton, a former Liberal Democrat MP who sits as a crossbencher, led the opposition to the Government's plans. He warned the Lords against believing in 'miracle cures'. He urged peers to back an amendment blocking the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Research Purposes) Regulations until a Lords select committee had 'reported on the issues connected with human cloning and stem cell research'.Lady Thatcher was among senior Tories who voted with Lord Alton. She was supported by Lord Tebbit, Lord Waddington, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, Lord Biffen, Lord Wakeham, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, Viscount Cranborne, Lord Strathclyde and Lord Lang of Monkton. Lord Alton was also supported by Lord Habgood, the former Archbishop of York, and the Bishop of St Albans.But the Alton amendment was defeated by 212 votes to 92. Peers then approved an amendment tabled by Lord Walton of Detchant, a crossbencher and former medical professor, saying that a select committee should investigate the regulations once they took effect. Lord Hunt said the Government would accept Lord Walton's proposal and 'listen to the committee and review the regulations in the light of the select committee report'.If the committee decided that stem cell research was unnecessary, it would be 'bound to take notice'. He also promised that the Government would introduce 'as soon as possible' a Bill to ban reproductive cloning, which is distinct from the therapeutic cloning covered by the regulations.Last month MPs voted for the regulations on a free vote by a majority of 192. But ministers thought they might lose in the Lords.Last week the Archbishop of Canterbury joined the Roman Catholic archbishops of Glasgow and Westminster, the Chief Rabbi and the President of the Muslim College in appealing to peers to block the regulations pending an investigation by a select committee. In an open letter, they said: 'These complex questions deserve to be examined in far greater detail than a brief debate on an unamendable order would permit.'Lord Alton questioned during the debate whether it was right to treat the human embryo as 'just another accessory to be created, bartered, frozen or destroyed'. He said: 'Since 1990, when miracle cures were promised for 4,000 inherited diseases, between 300,000 and half a million human embryos have been destroyed or experimented upon. There have been no cures, but our willingness to walk this road has paved the way for more and more demand.'Lady Warnock, who chaired the original inquiry into human fertilisation in the 1980s, acknowledged that there was a great deal of concern about the issue. Although she backed the Government because she was not opposed to the new research, she said that ministers were wrong to try to impose the regulations on the public in a hasty manner."
telegraph,1/6/2002 0:01,news,"   Dr Mark Tester, a scientific adviser to TV, is questioned by Roger Highfield over his condemnation of a new thriller.   You have accused the BBC of inflaming anti-GM hysteria with factual errors and bad science. Now Mr Rusbridger has rung you to defend the script. Did he convince you that it was plausible? He started by saying there must be one or two misunderstandings about what he was trying to do. I talked to him for half an hour explaining the implausibility of his story. I am sure he understood what I was saying, but he has not really taken it on board. It is a pity that he is not big enough to say he got it wrong, or that the science has moved on. Why do you reject the programme's claim that genes can transfer from plants to humans? Now that we have read the genetic sequences [genomes] of a range of organisms, we know that if it does happen it must be extremely rare. You can scan the genetic code of rice for signs of any transfer of genes between rice and human genetic codes. There is no evidence of a gene moving from a plant to a human, even though rice plants have been eaten by people for millions of years. There are no 'ghosts' in the genome of past gene transfers. Crops can be genetically modified by introducing rings of DNA, called plasmids, from bacteria. In the show, this was done in a food blender. Is that possible? No. And the deadly gene transferred with a plasmid was isolated from hospital waste. Is this possible? No. Bugs with this gene are very rare and such infections are notifiable and treated with great care. A lab working on the gene is the only plausible source. According to the show, the genes in a GM crop can be transferred to animals such as foxes because plasmids 'blow around'. That is crazy. Scientists have used antibiotic resistance genes in plants and there are concerns that they will lead to the creation of superbugs? Yes, there are theoretical concerns. A new EU directive now forbids the use of antibiotic resistance genes. Let's assume those 'blowing plasmids' could transfer a resistance gene to bacteria. Could that, as the show contends, really create an antibiotic resistant superbug that kills wildlife and the local elderly population? No. Just because a bug takes up an antibiotic resistance gene does not make it a superbug. The gene may even weaken the bug. Are you pro- or anti-GM? Both. I don't think GM food presents unusual risks but I am worried about the environmental impact of some GM crops. There are legitimate concerns; for instance, how insect toxin genes could spread from a crop to create superweeds. There are worries about how a small number of companies could control the food supply. But although rich Westerners can afford to oppose GM crops, as our food is cheap and plentiful, it is dangerous to oppose all uses of this technology, such as 'golden rice', a GM variety that can counter blindness.In the next 50 years there will be three billion more to feed. Increased food production will require many approaches, and GM will probably be one useful technology. Westerners have no right to deny others possibilities to improve their lot. What are you doing in your GM lab? In the Stress Laboratory at Cambridge University we are trying to employ GM to try to increase the tolerance of crops to salty soils. More than a quarter of the world's irrigated areas are so salty that agricultural productivity is restricted. This has galvanised a worldwide effort to develop crops to cope with high-sodium conditions. I am inspired by how biologists at the University of California and Toronto University have found a simple solution. By introducing into tomatoes a single gene that encodes a protein that pumps out excess salt before it does damage, they have created GM plants that flourish in salty water and produce edible fruit. We are trying to do similar types of things for rice. What do developing countries think of GM? More than three-quarters of the farmers that benefited from GM crops in 2001 were developing world farmers planting GM cotton, mainly in China and also in South Africa. The global area of GM crops for 2001 was 130 million acres, marking a 19 per cent annual increase. In 2001, four principal countries grew 99 per cent of the global crop: the US grew 68 per cent, followed by Argentina with 22 per cent, Canada six per cent and China three per cent. The number of farmers that benefited from GM crops increased from 3.5 million in 2000 to 5.5 million in 2001."
telegraph,20/11/2002 00:01,technology,"   European objections to GM food could have a devastating effect on the poorest countries of Africa, says Margaret Wilson       When Britain launched its public debate last week on genetically modified crops, the talk was of government indifference to the outcome. But the British response to GM has an importance that extends far beyond its shores. While this country's full-bellied citizens discuss the niceties of outcrossing and allergenicity, Africans are listening from countries where the issues are raw and overshadowed by starvation. Only last month one African country rejected GM food aid after consultations in Europe.Britain's - and Europe's - attitudes to GM are profoundly shaping the African response. Last week Gordon Conway, president of the development charity the Rockefeller Foundation, said that a European ban on GM crops would have a devastating effect on African agriculture.The repercussions of the British debate can be seen most acutely in Zambia, where three million people face the possibility of starvation because of drought. Some time after international relief maize began to arrive, the Zambian government discovered that it was partly GM and that accepting it had major environmental and perhaps health implications. Lacking the laboratories and protocols, Zambia turned to Europe for guidance and has now rejected 63,000 tonnes of American maize. It even turned down milled GM maize, free from seeds that farmers could plant.'We believe the government of Zambia has disregarded the scientific evidence and is rejecting the advice that accepting this safe maize to feed its hungry people would help avert human catastrophe,' the United States complained. But Zambia looks to Europe, not to America.Britain's pressure groups have had a hotline to the Zambian scientists entrusted with advising their government about GM relief maize. The Zambians have instinctively accepted their suspicion of the motives of the United States in flooding Africa with GM food - and they have been particularly moved by the health fears that erupted in Britain in 1999.In September, Zambia's scientists sped around Britain, Brussels, Holland, Norway, America and South Africa on a quest to understand GM issues. One of the seven-member team told me: 'I did see things differently from the way I saw them before I left: I got more scared.'Dr Mwananyanda Lewanika is a biochemist at Zambia's National Institute for Science and Technology, holds two degrees from American universities and has specialised in biosafety for five years. He explained that his team rejected the maize largely because of health concerns raised in Europe. His first concern is gene transfer - the idea that the foreign genes in GM plants could, while in the gut, transfer into the cells of the body or into bacteria in the gut. If the genes coded for antibiotic resistance, as they sometimes do, bacteria that picked them up could then rampage unchecked through human populations. Zambia's science minister, Abel Chambeshi, said a fortnight ago that donors are refusing to tell Zambia what kind of GM maize they have given.Dr Lewanika also fears unintended effects resulting from gene insertion - that the functions of genes are not fully understood, and they may produce unpredicted substances that could be poisonous or allergenic.How could Zambia's scientists have attached such weight to health risks that are mostly irrelevant to those who face starvation? During their three days in Britain, as well as meeting representatives from five government bodies, the team met a host of NGOs, many of whom pressed the health issues. According to the Zambia Daily Mail, Farming and Livestock Concern UK said that the virus used to create most GM varieties 'could form a retrovirus that could produce symptoms similar to HIV', a claim that will raise eyebrows among biologists. Genetic Food Alert raised the 'unknown and unassessed implications of providing large quantities of food containing resistance genes to a large population in Zambia'. The scientists themselves report that they met a host of groups, such as Econexas, the Natural Law Party and the Third World Network, as well as hearing the arguments of more well known organisations, such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Soil Association.These meetings convinced them that the health risks of GM are of even greater concern to Africans than to the First World.'The people of Zambia are in poor health,' says Dr Lewanika. 'Many are immune-compromised. If the health concerns are true, they are more likely to affect those in Zambia.'The fact that Zambians eat untreated maize, while Americans eat their GM maize in a highly processed form, was also important to the scientists. 'In Zambia corn is eaten as nshima [a porridge] for breakfast, lunch and supper. In America they eat it as cornflakes and tortilla chips, while corn on the cob is not genetically modified.' Foreign proteins in the maize would perish en route to becoming cornflakes, he argues, but might survive the mild simmering that turns maize flour into porridge.Kainyua M'bijjewe, Monsanto's spokesman in Africa, has accused groups such as Greenpeace of perpetuating starvation by helping to persuade African governments to reject GM foods. But Dr Lewanika dismisses such claims, saying that he is capable of assessing the soundness of research for himself.Instead, he says, it was the groups who thought Zambia should accept the GM maize that failed to provide scientific arguments. They came across as patronising and unsympathetic to the anguish that has characterised Zambia's GM trouble.Prof David King, Britain's chief scientist, appeared to Dr Lewanika to be dismissive. 'He said that Zambia doesn't have a choice [and must accept GM maize]. But he also said that he does have a choice so he would not eat it himself.'The Department for International Development said: 'You just accept it because you have no choice'. As a human being, I felt that these people actually didn't care. You are being told you are put in a position where it's given to you - so just accept it.'The pattern was repeated in the United States. 'We met no one who could put scientific arguments for accepting GM. We were just told, first, that they are tested and, second, that they are eaten in the States. But when we went to the National Academy of Sciences and obtained a copy of their report assessing the regulatory mechanism in the US it says it falls far short of what should be done.'The five other famine-threatened countries in southern Africa have accepted GM relief maize - four of them provided it is milled before distribution, a process that is expensive and time-consuming but eliminates environmental risks. But milling protects them only from an immediate invasion of GM. Mr Conway's argument is that Africa's agricultural future depends on Europe becoming more receptive to GM crops. If Europe rejects GM, then African countries that accept it could lose their export markets.'If in effect the EU says we will not buy any food from any country that happens to have GM crops growing in it, that will have enormous effect on African agriculture,' he said.Greenpeace has told Zambia that its burgeoning business selling organic produce to Europe could collapse if it accepts GM. The EU has denied this but Zambia decided to believe the NGOs. Peter Masunu, spokesman for the Zambian Department of Agriculture, said: 'The Zambian government does not have the capacity to detect whether food is genetically modified, we have not yet ratified the Cartagena agreement [covering the transport and use of modified organisms] and we have no legislation in place on biotechnology and biosafety.'Whether Zambia will weather its immediate storm, and feed its hungry without the help of GM maize, is debatable - no one can even agree how much non-GM maize is available. In the long term, Mr Conway argues, Africa's fate lies in European minds, shaped by debates such as that launched in Britain.'The developing countries, especially African, desperately need new crop variety, new medicines and vaccines. GM technology in Africa is not a silver bullet. But it is going to be essential if we are to produce crops resistant to pests, disease and weeds, tolerant of drought and of high nutritional quality.'"
telegraph,4/9/2003 10:13,news,"   Millie Forbes is seeking Mr Right - her life depends on it. And, reports Cassandra Jardine, she is match-making for other leukaemia victims   Millie Forbes has perfect, dark, Celtic-rose looks: a straight nose, high cheekbones, interestingly slanted eyes and chiselled lips. With a slender figure to match, she could easily be the latest aristocratic girl to follow Honor Fraser or Iris Palmer on to the catwalk.However, although Millie will soon be appearing in Tatler - possibly wearing clothes that she has designed herself - the story will not be about how the granddaughter of Lord Forbes, Scotland's premier earl, has become the new glamour sensation. When she appears on glossy paper, it will be because she needs a man. Even better, she would like a million men.'I had the idea of saying I am looking for Millie's Million,' she says, looking pale and a little nervous.It might seem odd that such an attractive 20-year-old should be so desperate for a date. But, Millie explains, she wants these men for one thing only - their stem cells. She hopes that they will be able to save her life and those of the 7,000 others in Britain waiting for tissue matches.Millie has acute myeloid leukaemia. Last year, she suffered through six months of intensive chemotherapy and believed she was cured. But the disease has returned, and her only chance of survival is to find someone with the same tissue type to donate blood stem cells.She has decided to meet me, with her sister, Bella, in tow, at the home of her friend, Val Rahtz, whom she has known ever since she went to primary school with Val's two sons.While her parents try to maintain some semblance of normality - Jonathan Forbes continuing his work for a security company and his wife Nicky giving her time to the Riding for the Disabled Association - Val has made her home the headquarters of an international campaign that has turned Millie from a victim into a fighting figurehead. Glamorous young girls, soon to return to university, are manning the phones as Val, Bella and Millie dream up more ruses for encouraging people to register their blood with the Anthony Nolan Trust - a charity set up in 1974 by a mother whose child had died for the lack of a stem cell transplant.Friends are about to do a charity bicycle ride from Inverness to Fort William and back. Her old school - St Leonard's in St Andrews - is organising a donor campaign. Millie herself is contemplating an auction or a dinner in England. There is talk of a concert. Bella has an idea for a Valentine's Day 'Are you a match-maker?' campaign. The names of those whom they might ask for help are constantly being batted back and forth - including Gary Lineker and Alastair Campbell, both keen supporters of leukaemia charities.'We're running it a bit like a Blue Peter appeal,' says Millie. In just four weeks, they have succeeded in encouraging 2,000 people to have blood tests. Calls of support are coming in from all over the world and Val is opening sheaves of envelopes containing cheques from those who are too old to be tested but who want to help fund the tests - they cost the Anthony Nolan Trust £70 each.Amid all this frenzied activity, Millie looks tired. Like any girl of her age, she is almost more interested in the new jeans she has just bought, which she is wearing with a sweatshirt proclaiming her membership of the Junior Scotland lacrosse team in 2001.'I love dressing up,' she says, 'but I haven't made the effort today.' For the photographer, she will bring out her 'slap and cement', as she calls the make-up she puts on to hide her pallor.She starts to talk about her illness. At this stage, she doesn't want to know too many facts and hasn't asked her doctor many questions for fear of getting straight answers. 'I don't need to be depressed - the facts are more useful as eye-openers for healthy people,' she says. Her last weekly blood test showed that her condition was stable, but she knows the disease could suddenly gallop.It has all happened very quickly. A year ago, she had just finished a gap year in Paris, doing an art foundation course, before going to Northumbria University to study fashion and marketing. Then, in August, she went on holiday to Ireland. 'I was swimming in a wide river with friends,' she recalls. 'I have swum in rivers all my life, but this time, I was way behind the others. I felt like I was having cramp but there was no reason why. I was so exhausted that I thought I would never reach the side.' 'This is the end,' I thought, but I managed to cling to the reeds and a friend swam with me to safety. When I got out, I was very cold and my lips were purple. It took me ages to get my circulation going.'She expected the doctor to say she had anaemia or glandular fever, but a blood test showed that her red cell count, which should have been 14 or 15, was down to five. She was sent straight to hospital, diagnosed with a quick-moving myeloid leukaemia, and began the first of five courses of chemotherapy at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.Those horrible six months were made bearable by the kindness of the nurses, the support of her family and the friendship of a 21-year-old patient who arrived in a far worse state but is so fully recovered that she is having a baby. Last February, Millie emerged hairless - 'I was only annoyed because, for the first time, I had grown my hair long' - and convinced that she had beaten the disease.This summer, she was feeling so well that she took a cookery course and began to make plans. The monthly blood tests had become so routine that, in July, her mother dropped her off and did the shopping. She returned in time to hear the doctor say that Millie's red blood cell count was down again, the white cells were multiplying and her only chance of survival was a stem cell transplant.Each person gets half of the six components of their tissue type from their mother and half from their father. The chances of a sibling match are one in four, but neither Bella nor Millie's younger brother, Jamie, proved a match. There was a two-thirds chance, the family were told, of finding a match from an unrelated donor on the register run by the Anthony Nolan Trust.'We just assumed it would be all right,' says Millie. But no match was found from the 340,000 on the British register. In August, having heard the news, Nicky Forbes drove to Val's house to give her some ball tickets that she would no longer be using - Millie was too tired for parties. What was needed was a campaign to find more potential donors, they agreed, and Val volunteered to run it.So, for the past month, Val's husband and two sons have had to look after themselves while she works round the clock to find more names to go on the Anthony Nolan Trust register to save Millie and all those in a similar situation. Although the ANT register was the first in the world, those in America and Germany are much larger. Shortage of funds and lack of publicity limit the numbers of young men and women coming forward to save the lives of those who suffer not just from leukaemia but also from lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, aplastic anaemia and genetic disorders that afflict children. (Male donors are slightly preferable because they don't have to go off the register to have children and are less prone to anaemia.) The website for what has turned out to be one of the biggest campaigns ever was set up in four days. Billy Connolly, who lives locally, kicked off the appeal by being photographed with Millie on the bronze bull in her home town of Alford, where the Aberdeen Angus originated. 'She wants your blood,' he bellowed. The campaign's supporters are wearing www.milliweb.net T-shirts, displaying posters, handing out flyers and putting stickers on their car bumpers.For Millie, the attention came as a shock. 'When I first heard about the website, I didn't want to see it,' she says. 'But I've warmed to it now. I want to help as many people as I can - as well as myself.'    Millie's Campaign, see www.milliweb.net. Cheques can be sent to Glenecht, Echt, Westhill, Aberdeenshire AB32 7AB; tel: 01330 860782. All funds go to the Anthony Nolan Trust.

telegraph,11/1/2004 0:01,finance,"   The biotech minnow is developing a diet pill with huge potential, but needs funds to market it, writes Lauren Mills  Alizyme, a small biotechnology company based in Cambridge, is fast mutating into one of Britain's most promising drug companies.Last year the company more than quadrupled in size, as its share price soared from 31.5p to around 170p, making it the Telegraph's best performing Equity View share recommendation for the past 12 months.It is intriguing that a loss-making company employing only 15 people can become such a stock market star. The explanation is simple.Towards the end of last year, Alizyme announced that the research data for its anti-obesity, irritable bowel syndrome and ulcer drugs looked promising. This promoted it into a select band of UK biotechnology companies that may be capable of delivering on promises.In an industry whose reputation is more miss-and-miss than hit-and-miss, this would be no small feat.So what precisely has Alizyme achieved? It announced that Renzapride, its treatment for irritable bowel syndrome, was ready to enter final stage trials.Also phase II trials for ATL-962, its anti-obesity drug, showed that the treatment aided weight loss without the damaging side effects of rival products. And ATL-962 has won patent approval for the treatment of obesity and type II diabetes in the important US market.Alizyme's arch rival in the race to launch a safe and effective fat-busting drug is Roche. The Swiss drug giant has already launched Xenical onto the market, but its unpleasant side effects, such as diarrhoea, have caused annual sales to dip from a peak of Sf1bn (£400m) to around Sf600m (£267m).Both drugs work by obstructing the body's ability to absorb fat, thereby reducing calorie intake. Given that Alizyme's drug could be described as 'Xenical without the side effects', Alizyme looks well placed to grab a large slice of the lucrative anti-obesity cake.So just how big could it be? Dr Richard Palmer, the chief executive, is optimistic. 'We knew we had to come up with something that had a better side-effect profile [than Xenical] so we set out to find a new chemical family that would achieve the same thing. And, yes, our theories have paid off. It is partly a case of luck and partly our experience and expertise.'We knew that as a 'me too' drug, it was unlikely to gain more than 25 per cent market share, but it's a very big market so the returns could be very attractive.'Most analysts agree that Alizyme's diet pill is a potential blockbuster. Some believe sales could exceed $1bn a year.There is a potential glitch though. Unless Palmer can find a joint venture partner - probably one of the big pharmaceutical companies - to fund the project through its costly final stage studies, his dreams of counting the profits may never be a reality.His chances of luring a partner seem good. Many of the world's largest drugs giants have gaps in their late-stage drug pipelines. This means they are keen to buy the rights to promising biotechnology products, which they can develop and launch on the market.Last August, Alizyme sold the Japanese rights for ATL-962 to Takeda, Japan's biggest pharmaceutical company, in its first revenue-generating deal. Alizyme receives an up front payment of $2m with another $40m payable as the drug passes further milestones.But the big question for Palmer is whether he should continue to license Alizyme's products to big drug companies, or sell the whole business while the going remains good.He is pragmatic on the issue. 'This is a risk business,' he says. 'We may not find partners. We may not find anybody to buy the company. We may not find new products to bring in to continue to leverage the skills and expertise that have built this company over the past seven years. This is the real world.'However, on the basis of experience, the likelihood of not finding a partner is low. The likelihood of not being able to find new products to develop the company organically is low.'But the likelihood of finding somebody who would wish to buy us at a price that would be fair to the shareholders, reflecting the value that has not yet been unlocked, is also low.'In plain English, this means Palmer would sell up, but thinks it unlikely anyone will offer the right price. The implication is that he would prefer to remain independent.Palmer says the big pharmaceutical companies have already shown a lot of interest in Alizyme's products. So far, though, there are no offers on the table and it is unlikely that any joint venture arrangements would be signed before the middle of this year.As with any biotechnology company, Alizyme's financial clock - as it eats its way through its cash resources - is ticking. Surely then, it is compromised when it comes to negotiating licensing deals with the big pharmaceutical companies?Palmer is adamant that this is not the case. 'If there is competition for a product or asset, our cash position becomes irrelevant. For all of these products we have more than one potential partner that is very interested.'Anyway, last October Alizyme raised £11m through an institutional placing in a bid to strengthen the company's hand as it negotiates licensing deals.But Palmer does not underestimate the challenge. 'Until a product has been on the market for a few years - so you can see how it behaves in the ordinary patient population - you don't know whether it will be a full success,' he says. 'People licence dreams.'"
telegraph,28/02/2003 00:00,news,"   The nobel laureates involved describe how they made their discovery and tell Roger Highfield and Matt Ridley about their vision of the future  Watson: 'Honest Jim' tells Roger Highfield about his hopes for human genetic enhancementJames Watson is one of the most passionate advocates of DNA manipulation, not just of plants and animals but of people, too. Even though no one knows the final destination of the DNA revolution, he wants us all to get there double quick.The youngest of the double helix Nobel laureates, Watson remains the most influential and will be feted in April at an anniversary dinner in London, at which the Prime Minister and other luminaries have been invited to toast the 1953 breakthrough.Watson's artless candour long ago earned him the nickname 'Honest Jim'. He made headlines for inviting Posh and Becks to the dinner, and for suggesting that plump black people have better sex lives than the model Kate Moss. Of his work as a fundraiser, he said: 'I really like rich people'; and, describing his colleague, remarked: 'I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood.'As a schoolboy growing up in Chicago, Watson was small, unathletic, and shy. He was also unpopular, and often bullied. His consolation lay in books and he was one of the junior geniuses who wrestled with brain twisters on The Quiz Kids, a halfhour radio show.In 1940, at the age of 12, he was confirmed. But, disillusioned by the war and how religious explanations seemed to be 'myths from the past', he gave up mass to go birdwatching: 'I came to the conclusion that the Church was just a bunch of fascists that supported Franco. I stopped going on Sunday mornings and watched the birds with my father instead.'His interest in ornithology would evolve, through a fascination with the then mystery of migration, into science. Like the other DNA pioneers, he was also deeply influenced as a teenager by Erwin Schrödinger 's book What is Life?, which suggested the idea of a molecular code that carried genetic information.Even though Watson entered the University of Chicago precociously, as a 15 yearold, his search for a graduate school almost came to nothing. Caltech turned him down. Harvard accepted him, though with no financial help. But he did make it to Indiana, which was strong in genetics.He moved to Sir Lawrence Bragg's biophysics unit of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge in 1951. After the triumphant discovery with Crick, Watson did not rest on his DNA laurels. He decided to leave Cambridge, despite its overwhelming influence on biology at that time. 'Francis being such a dominant person, I had to. My own career demanded I separate from Francis.'He would become an intellectual impresario, turning Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on the East Coast of America, where he is now president, into one of the world's principal centres of biology and leading the effort to read the human genetic code.Today, Watson believes in designer babies because he has faith in human genes in particular, those that underpin our ability to care for one another. He argues that much of the public paranoia surrounding human genetic manipulation is inspired by a legitimate recognition of our selfish side, where one person benefits at the expense of others.But this is only half the story: humans do not only compete, they cooperate and care for each other. In his new book, DNA: The Secret of Life, he goes further: 'So fundamental is it to human nature that I am sure that the capacity to love is inscribed in our DNA a secular Paul would say that love is the greatest gift of our genes to humanity.'The constellation of genes that makes us love one another will protect us. 'Love, that impulse which promotes our caring for one another, is what has permitted our survival and success on the planet. It is this impulse that I believe will safeguard our future as we venture into uncharted genetic territory.'By uncharted territory, he means the use of genetic manipulation to alter plants, animals and even people. 'If, some day, the genes linked with love could be enhanced by our science, to defeat petty hatreds and violence, in what sense would our humanity be diminished?'Watson is dismayed by the angst over GM technology, spurred by pressure groups 'who raise money by raising fears'. But even many of his peers are convinced that scientists should never attempt germline gene therapy, where the consequences of GM are passed to future generations. 'Whether based in ethics or unfounded fears of the unknown, such arguments are ultimately not compelling, in my judgment. Germ line therapy is, in principle, simply putting right what chance has put horribly wrong.'Germ line gene therapy has the potential for making humans resistant to the ravages of HIV. Some say we should focus on education about the dangers of promiscuous sex. 'I find such a moralistic response to be profoundly immoral,' Watson says. 'Education has proven a powerful but hopelessly insufficient weapon in our war.'Indeed, Watson goes further, advocating genetic enhancement. 'Having identified the relevant genes, would we want to exercise a future power to transform slow learners into fast ones, before they are even born? We are not dealing in science fiction: we can already give mice better memories. Is there a reason why our goal shouldn't be to do the same for humans?'All parents want to enhance their kids. I think you can be against it only because we can do it.' Is that influenced in any way by anguish over his own son, Rufus, who has a mental disorder? 'I am very much wanting people to have healthy children.' And he is passionate that this kind of decision should be down to the individual, not the state. Despite being pro germ line therapy, he is not in favour of cloning. 'You want a law. You don't want 50 people looking like Gwyneth Paltrow.'One field that fascinates him is neuroscience, as it does Crick. The big question he would like answered is: 'How a telephone number is stored in my brain.'Another fascination is cancer. Even though Rosalind Franklin died of cancer, his sister died of liver failure related to chemotherapy, and his father died of lung cancer due to a 'two packs of Camel a day habit,' this interest was and has always been driven by his intellectual curiosity.In 1998, Watson made headlines when he said that the research of Judah Folkman at Harvard Medical School, which had shown promise in mice, would cure cancer within two years. The throwaway comment at a dinner party typical of 'Honest Jim' would get him into hot water, as has happened many times.The problem with conventional approaches to cancer is that tumours contain many cell types, so that some always survive attack by a drug to launch a new invasion of the body. That is why Folkman's approach cutting off with drugs the tumour's blood supply, a stable target is so promising. 'I still see a lot of Judah,' he says. 'We are no longer satisfied by understanding cancer, as we were for a long time. We will only be satisfied if we stop cancer.'Crick: in an exclusive interview, Matt Ridley meets the 'brainiest' of the double helix pioneersAt 86 years old, Francis Crick is frail compared with the giant presence whose ideas, eyebrows and laugh have dominated two fields of biology for nearly half a century.By common consent the brainiest of the DNA heroes of 1953, and the obvious candidate to challenge Einstein for scientist of the century, Crick will miss all the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the double helix. He has ceased all travelling and these days stays in his flower-decked bungalow in the hills above La Jolla in California. A humming bird flits over the restless robot cleaning the swimming pool as I wait for him. Frail or not, he does as good an imitation of bounding into a room as a man leaning on a walking stick can do, settles into a chair and begins to talk at once. The loud loquacity that made him and Watson so irritating to colleagues in Cambridge is undimmed. 'They thought we talked too much. That's why we were put in a room by ourselves.' With fateful consequences.An occasional shadow of discomfort passes across his craggy features as he talks. He is wearing a strange, psychedelic-brown garment, a sort of cross between a cardigan and a dressing gown. The walls are filled with elegant drawings of nudes done by his artist wife, Odile, who first drew the double helix. But there is no time for small talk. The ideas are already tumbling out. He is still passionate, still hungry for new explanations of how the world comes to be the way it is.Born in 1916, the son of a Northampton shoe manufacturer, Crick's genius is almost entirely self-taught. At the age when his three future collaborators and rivals were apprentices to some of the great scientific minds of the day, he ran a team of engineers redesigning the circuits in magnetic mines for the Admiralty. At the war's end, he was in naval intelligence and, not wanting to make weapons in peacetime, he cast about for a new challenge. He could not decide between explaining consciousness and explaining life.Just this month he published a paper, with his collaborator Christof Koch, in which he draws a sort of virtual map for how to find the seat of consciousness in the brain. 'The question is easy to pose. We're virtually certain that much of the activity of our brains is unconscious. Some activities must be conscious. Question is, what is the difference between them?'But it was the secret of life itself that gave Crick a uniquely sudden scientific triumph in 1953. He had arrived at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge in 1949, at the age of 33, determined to find the structure of the molecule that carried heredity. Jim Watson's arrival in 1951 was the catalyst. 'Jim knew all the people in genetics. There was nobody else I could talk to about the subject.' Talk they did.Can he recall the moment he first saw Watson's base pairs that Saturday morning, exactly 50 years ago today? 'Oh yes. Of course, I realised immediately it obeys Chargaff's rules [that DNA contains the same amount of adenine as thymine and guanine as cytosine]. 'I'd been trying to do experiments the previous summer to try and show how the bases went together. It was Jim who didn't believe in Chargaff's rules. What Jim didn't notice was the symmetry - the bonds which go from the sugar to the base form the sides of an isosceles triangle. That showed the chains running in opposite directions. I pointed this out to Jim, I said, 'Look, it's got the right symmetry'. I had deduced that from the space group; the symmetry elements of the unit cell.'Crick can, apparently, think in three ways at once - in words, in algebra and in visual images. From the diffraction pattern of an X-ray of a crystal, he knows what geometry to expect among its atoms. 'It's a subtle thing,' he says. 'If the two chains are parallel then they repeat after half a turn, but if they're aniparallel they have to go round a whole turn before they repeat. I knew all this before the base pairs. The net result, going from one residue to the next, you went through 18 degrees if the chains were parallel; but if they were antiparallel, you went through 36 degrees. Jim was trying to build it with 18 degree angles - too tight. I said you can't build it like that. And he tried and tried and said you try - he went off to play tennis. And I built it at 36 degrees and said, there it is, 36 degrees, you see. So we had all this background - so when we had the base pairs, it all clicked into position.'Does he think they unfairly stole the X-ray information from the London scientists, Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins? 'No. We were trying to help them, remember, to get them to build models. Were we right to use models? Yes. Maurice had been converted to our point of view; he was waiting for Rosalind to go. Rosalind never came round to the idea of building models. She didn't even have the things to build the model with.'He has no hesitation in saying the current vogue for crediting Franklin with the most important part of the discovery has gone too far. 'She had no idea about symmetry. She didn't even know that in a biological molecule like DNA you can't get mirror planes - because it turns a left hand into a right hand and vice versa.' The major biological macromolecules are of only one hand. 'If I had gone to the talk she gave [in November 1951] instead of Jim, we would have got there much sooner, because almost all the things we needed were given in the talk, including the space group.' And if neither of them had seen the King's data? 'Rosalind would have left King's as planned, and Maurice would have taken up the job again. I would have encouraged him to build models and he alone would have got the structure.'That's why it's important not to put too much stress on who made the discovery. The important thing was the discovery. The whole thing was a chapter of accidents. That's the way many discoveries are made.'Over lunch by the pool - Arctic char, asparagus and strawberries - Crick adds that Franklin, who became a close friend afterwards, especially during her last illness, never complained that she deserved more credit. She was pleased at the recognition she got and she knew she had only done part of the work. Odile Crick interposes: 'And Jim was wrong: she wore very nice clothes.'Crick saw the possibilities of the double helix almost instantly. 'The funny thing was how nervous Jim was about the structure. He didn't like me explaining it to people. Didn't want to say anything in the paper. 'He wanted us to leave out any discussion of the implications. I said we can't do that. That's the reason for that funny sentence in the first paper. [It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.] Jim wouldn't let me put anything else in.'But nothing happened. The biochemists ignored the double helix for years. Virtually nothing appeared in the newspapers. 'I didn't get tenure after double helix. They gave me a seven-year appointment - thought it was a flash in the pan, you see. It didn't bother me at all.'It was no flash in the pan. More than any of the other three, Crick followed up the double helix with a series of vital discoveries. He was the first to predict the existence of transfer RNA, the key to protein synthesis, and he is especially proud of his 1961 experiment with Sydney Brenner, which used self-cancelling mutations to prove that the genetic code is written in three-letter words.He even beat evolution at its own game by devising an elegant hypothesis, the 'comma-free code', which encodes genetic information with fewer errors than the code Mother Nature turned out to use. 'It's a beautiful example of an idea that was very pretty but totally wrong. If we knew how the code evolved, we'd know why it is the way it is. But it evolved too long ago.' His reputation for theoretical speculation soon made him the most watched person in biology. By 1980, Leslie Orgel and he were predicting the existence of 'selfish' DNA, in the form of self-copying sequences: it is now known that genomes are riddled with the stuff, a bit like computer viruses.His only regret is championing a theory that life is likely to have originated on a different planet and travelled here in a primitive form. 'It was a nutty idea, but if you read my book [Life Itself], it explains it's a nutty idea. If I'd realised the reception it would get I'd have done it differently.'Crick's relationship with Watson remains one of the enigmas of scientific history. 'Jim and I hit it off immediately,' he wrote in his autobiography, but after 1953 they drifted apart. By 1968 they were enemies, Crick inveighing against Watson's The Double Helix ('not sufficiently scholarly'). Crick persuaded Harvard University Press not to publish the book. They have since patched up their friendship - mostly. 'We thought alike at that time; I don't think we think alike so much now. When Jim says he doesn't understand how the brain stores a telephone number, he's just speaking out of ignorance.' Crick does not approve of Watson's frequent forays into controversy. He knows that his name will be forever linked with Watson's as one helix is linked with the other. But the strands of DNA are antiparallel, not parallel.Unlike most scientists, including Watson, Crick never allowed himself to be promoted into management. 'I don't particularly like manipulating people: it's not to my taste.' He remains to this day an active scientist, sitting in on experiments, reading about discoveries, brainstorming ideas and writing papers. He retains a healthy distaste for philosophy - 'the only thing philosophers can agree on is the value of philosophy'.Asked if reducing life to a four-letter code and consciousness to a pattern of neuronal firings does not take some of the spiritual meaning out of the world, he robustly disgrees. 'Just the opposite. When you think of the way evolution makes things, the details with which even flowers are done, it's absolutely extraordinary, much more than the layman realises.'Asked to predict the future, Crick reels off his failures as a prophet. He never foresaw genetic fingerprinting, which he credits for DNA's present fame and the 'excessive' interest in the current anniversary. He never saw how easy genetic engineering or genome sequencing would become. 'You can see what will happen 10 or 15 years out, but never much longer than that.'So what will happen in 10 or 15 years? Crick is off immediately, thinking about a new problem, how genes work together. 'Getting the sequence right was easy. The hard part is working out what controls the rate at which genes act. That's controlled by proteins which are controlled by other genes. It is going to be difficult to unscramble. We can only hope that there may be a subclass of theories that apply to evolved systems. It's not unlike the problem of the brain.'If ever there was a brain that could crack it, it's Crick's.n  n  Nature via Nurture, by Matt Ridley, will be published by Fourth Estate in April n The third man: Wilkins feels his contribution was undervalued, writes Roger HighfieldEven though Maurice Wilkins was to share the Nobel prize for work on the DNA double helix, he did not share the limelight. Now aged 86, he still feels that popular accounts have underplayed his contribution, along with that of others who worked alongside him half a century ago at King's College London.Wilkins is now working on an autobiography - The Third Man of the Double Helix - in which he intends to correct the record, not least the account of events in Watson's famously indiscreet 1968 book, The Double Helix. Wilkins bears no malice towards Watson and Crick. They had asked him if he minded if they, too, worked on DNA; as his friends, they had invited him to co-author the Nature paper that unveiled the double helix in April 1953. Wilkins declined, because he had not helped them build their now famous model of DNA. Today, however, he feels that he made a mistake, because his co-authorship would have underlined the crucial cooperation with King's. 'That is my one regret,' he says.Wilkins was born in New Zealand; his family moved to Birmingham when he was six. While a teenager, he studied solar energy and built a series of telescopes in his workshop at home. He read physics at Cambridge, and during the war worked on uranium enrichment for the Manhattan Project in Berkeley, California. (Later, he said he was disgusted by Hiroshima and Nagasaki.)Like both Watson and Crick, the teenage Wilkins was inspired by What is Life?, written by the brilliant Austrian quantum mechanic Erwin Schrödinger. 'I did not understand most of what he said,' Wilkins says. 'But he wrote that a gene is an aperiodic crystal, and I had worked in that area. I thought, this is what I must work on.'He turned to biophysics, and ended up at King's College London in 1946. There, he became assistant director to Sir John Randall at the Medical Research Council Unit in 1950, then, with Raymond Gosling, began X-ray diffraction studies of calf-thymus DNA.The well-defined patterns of X-rays scattered by the crystals of the purified DNA, produced in the summer of 1950, gave the first insights into the structure of DNA. Even today, he believes the significance of this work has been underplayed.Working with Alec Stokes, a mathematical physicist, Wilkins came up with a key insight in 1951: the X-ray pattern suggested that DNA had a regular structure, a helix of some sort. He believes that the contribution of Stokes, who died earlier this month, has been overlooked. Stokes himself wrote: 'I sometimes think the result was worth perhaps 1 47;5,000 of a Nobel prize.' The rule that the prize should not be shared by more than three people is unfair, says Wilkins. 'The Nobel prize is outdated. It should have recognised all the people who worked on DNA.'That, of course, includes Rosalind Franklin. But, if the prize had to go to only three people, he believes that Franklin would not have qualified in 1962, even if she had lived. 'She only spent two years in our lab and we went on for a decade after the double helix to do the job properly.' Franklin is now seen as central to the breakthrough. Watson's accounts suggest her best DNA diffraction pattern (he was shown her picture 51 by Wilkins in 1953) was the defining moment in understanding DNA. Wilkins is 'very puzzled' by this 'over the top' recollection. Two years earlier, in 1951, he had written to Crick about the helical structure, with a sketch of the key part of a DNA X-ray pattern. And, in a letter to his mentor Max Delbruck, Watson even mentioned Wilkins's work, followed by three exclamation marks. 'They knew I was going on about helices all the time,' says Wilkins. 'They didn't seem to take much notice.''Watson agrees that 'helices were in the air'. DNA had to be a helix of some sort, otherwise they would have been stuck. But Stokes had not then published his analysis and picture 51 came as a revelation, because it 'was so perfect'.Wilkins agrees that Franklin's image was the 'nicest', but she did not seem to realise its significance, having sat on it for eight months without discussing it with anyone. Towards the end of her work at King's, she had been vehemently 'anti helix'. One American article even said that 'unscrupulous Wilkins' had stolen Franklin's results, as he had shown picture 51 to Watson. The claim was later retracted. She had handed Wilkins the image in anticipation of giving up her work on DNA. Did he regret showing it to Watson? 'No. I would have regretted it if I hadn't.'Wilkins is adamant that Franklin was not the victim of institutional sexism; indeed, he was one of the first to defend her reputation. He was offended by the account of Franklin's dowdy appearance and obstructiveness in Watson's 1968 book The Double Helix. Originally, he joined with Francis Crick to try to stop the book being published. 'Francis took the initiative because it was rather insulting to him.'Wilkins now acknowledges that The Double Helix was pioneering - it gave a vivid insight into the personalities and process of science. The public believes that scientists 'are straightforward rational people who keep their noses down on the bench, who think things out carefully and are sensible about it,' he says. 'The point is, when they get really excited, it is not true. That is what happened with DNA.'"

telegraph,20/06/2003 00:01,news," A couple banned from creating a test tube 'designer baby' in Britain to help cure their seriously ill four-year-old son have had a baby boy after treatment in America.Jamie Whitaker, who was born by caesarean section on Monday, was selected from nine embryos to be the best possible tissue match for his brother Charlie.His parents hope to use stem cells from his umbilical cord to treat Charlie's life-threatening blood disease.Jamie is only the second British baby to undergo 'tissue typing' tests as an embryo. In 2001, a couple used the same technique to create a suitable donor for a son with leukaemia.Yesterday's announcement triggered a debate over the ethics of screening embryos for desirable traits, and how far the state should interfere with parental choice.Charlie suffers from diamond blackfan anaemia, a rare blood disorder in which bone marrow produces too few red blood cells. The disease has to be treated with painful injections of steroids and blood transfusions.The only cure is a transplant of bone marrow stem cells from a donor with the same immune system cells. Neither of Jamie's parents, Michelle and Jayson, nor his 23-month-old sister, Emily, were suitable.A naturally-conceived sibling has a one-in-four chance of being a match. After giving birth to Emily, the couple wanted to improve the chances by screening embryos created by IVF.After their request was rejected by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, the couple were treated at the Reproductive Genetics Institute in Chicago. The baby was delivered by caesarean section at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield.Mr Whitaker, 33, from Derbyshire, said: 'We have always wanted four children, so we just combined having more with helping Charlie.'Blood tests over the next few days will reveal whether he is a perfect tissue match. Any transplant operation is unlikely to take place for another six months.The HFEA previously gave permission to Raj and Shahana Hashmi to treat their sick four-year-old son Zain. 'We have to look at the benefit for the embryo, not just the sibling,' a spokesman said.'We have to be quite strict in the way we issue licences. We look at the scientific, medical and moral issues before making any decision. HFEA policy states women are allowed to have treatment only for the benefit of the embryo. It is a tough decision to make.'Pro-life campaigners object to the deliberate destruction of embryos. Others have questioned whether the use of babies for 'spare parts' would be as acceptable if the recipient had been the baby's mother rather than a young brother. There is also a one in 50 chance that Jamie will carry the same disease as his brother.Pyschologists have argued that babies born to provide tissue to transplant may resent their siblings later in life.Jack Scarisbrick, of the anti-abortion charity Life, said: 'This is a heart-tugging story but it is wrong that of nine human beings created, eight have died. There has been a huge deliberate wastage of human life.'No doubt this boy will be very much loved but children should be brought into the world unconditionally and not to serve some other purpose.'Juliet Tizzard, director of the Progress Educational Trust which promotes reproductive and genetic science, said: 'In the real world, where babies are often unplanned and sometimes unwanted, it ought to be a cause for celebration that this couple have a new son who will be loved and cherished and could also help his older sibling.'"
telegraph,29/07/2006 00:01,news," A new way of promoting healing when fractured bones refuse to mend has been pioneered at a British hospital, saving patients permanent disability or amputation.          Three patients who had run out of treatment options have handed back their crutches. A total of five out of 10 are making progress but it can take some months for the treatment to begin to work.          Doctors at the Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital, Oswestry, Shropshire, are harvesting stem cells from the patient's bone marrow, growing them and then applying them to the fracture site, where they help broken bone grow again and unite.          Prof James Richardson, consultant surgeon, said yesterday: 'The stem cells then help to grow new bone and literally 'knit' the fracture site together.         The doctors are planning to use the treatment on another 30 cases and are looking for patients whose fractures are more recent so they can try the stem cell therapy earlier than in the 10 treated to date.          Jane Figgett, 45, from Alcester, Warwicks, broke her leg six years ago in a minor fall down some steps. She was a trainee nurse with four children, the youngest being two at the time of her injury.          It was a difficult fracture and she expected to be in plaster for eight or nine weeks.          But the fracture would not heal. The bone was first pinned, then plated. Then Mrs Figgett had external rods fixed to hold the bone in place as well as a bone fragment transplant from her hip.           Amputation was being considered.          Mrs Figgett was one of the first patients to receive a stem cell implant. It has taken six months for progress to be made but there are now signs that the bone is mending and her mobility is improving, a hospital spokesman said."
telegraph,19/06/2003 00:00,news," Britain's first genetic 'designer' baby has been born to a couple desperate to cure their young son who has a rare form of anaemia. Jamie Whitaker was delivered by Caesarean section on Monday after being genetically matched, while still an IVF embryo, to his four-year-old brother Charlie. Charlie has the rare Diamond Blackfan anaemia which only a transplant of stem cells from a sibling with a perfect tissue match can cure. His parents, Jayson and Michelle, travelled to the Reproductive Genetics Institute in Chicago for treatment after being refused permission to genetically select a tissue match embryo by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Mr Whittaker, 33, a business manager who has recently moved his family from Bicester, Oxon to a Derbyshire village, said: 'All we did was change the odds from a one-in-four chance of a tissue match to a 98 per cent chance. 'There was no selection on the basis of colour of eyes or hair or sex.' He added: 'There are blood tests being carried out now to see if Jamie is a perfect tissue match and we will know in a few days, but at the moment we don't want to think about the stem cell blood.' The vital stem cells have already been collected from Jamie's umbilical cord and tests will also be carried out to determine if the new baby has the same anaemia condition as his brother. "
telegraph,24/08/2000 00:00,news," DR LIAM FOX, shadow health secretary: 'There is genuine political unease about many of the medical techniques. Euthanasia, genetic research, cloning and infertility treatment have all raised considerable public concern. The questions that the medical revolution raises are too important to be left to scientists and doctors alone. Society must tackle them.'There are those who say that the ends justify the means. For those who have crossed the Rubicon and support the current legislative position, a move from fertility research to therapeutic cloning is hardly a quantum leap.'Yet for those of us who never accepted the moral legitimacy of the current legislation, it is merely the extension of an already unacceptable position.' Comment on Reproductive Ethics: 'Early human life is destroyed in massive numbers in embryo research, and no matter how worthy the objectives of the research, this can never be justified. Embryo research was immoral in 1990 and remains so.'It is unbelievably bad science to even suggest moving to human cloning when animal cloning is at such a primitive stage. A public worried about GM food and BSE should be told the absolute truth about cloning.' Life, the pro-life charity: 'The report is being hailed for recommending that the go-ahead be given to human cloning when, at the same time, it is giving excellent reasons why we do not need it.'It wants approval of stem cell research - that is, research into how the basic cells of the human body can be programmed to become organs or tissue for conquering diseases. But it is not recommending that any treatment be undertaken. Umbilical cords, for instance, are a very rich source, and using their cells poses no ethical or practical difficulties. So we do not need clones at all.' Christian Action Research and Education, Dr Andrew Fergusson, medical adviser: 'We are pleased that the Government said no to allowing cloned human children or adults but we're concerned that the development of cloning techniques and the use of cloned embryos will open the door to the possibility of cloned children in the future.' Cardinal Thomas Winning, Archbishop of Glasgow and chairman of the bioethics committee of the Catholic Bishops of Great Britain and Ireland: 'The recommendation will shock and disappoint many.'Human stem cell research is a scientific field that may offer promising new developments in health care, but science cannot operate in a vacuum. Obtaining stem cells from a human embryo is morally wrong because it involves the destruction of a human life.' Right to Life, Martin Casey: 'The report is a predictable charade. It is arrogance and irresponsibility of the worst kind to recommend the go-ahead for so-called therapeutic cloning.'It is being offered up to sufferers as a panacea to cure a whole range of serious conditions without any proof that this method is any more likely to produce results than the ethically and morally more responsible route of using adult stem cells.' The Campaign Against Human Genetic Engineering: 'The decision paves the way for unscrupulous entrepreneurs to produce a baby by cloning. Until there is a global ban on reproductive cloning there should be a moratorium on creating embryos by cloning.'"
telegraph,1/12/2002 0:01,finance," Lauren Mills examines the crisis in the pharmaceutical sector, ravaged by the cost of bringing new drugs to the market  A crisis is looming in Britain's cash-starved biotechnology industry which could see many smaller companies collapse and precipitate widespread industry consolidation.The sector is infamous for over-promising and under-delivering. In the past two decades, Britain has produced only two profitable biotech companies - Celltech and PowderJect Pharmaceuticals.Despite a $5bn cash injection into the sector in the past 20 years, only a handful of products have been successfully launched. So it is not surprising that shareholders and fund managers, increasingly risk-averse, are reluctant to invest in biotechnology.However, an announcement two weeks ago that Antisoma, a cancer drug specialist, has signed a lucrative alliance with Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, gives a glimmer of hope that sentiment towards British biotechnology companies may be about to improve.Roche has paid $37m for Antisoma's entire cancer drug pipeline. The companies say the deal could be worth up to $500m to the cancer specialist if 10 drugs make it to the market. But, given that only one drug in 10 survives clinical trials, this is unlikely. Even so, few analysts contest that Antisoma has pulled off something of a coup. The market agreed, sending Antisoma's shares soaring 128 per cent to 29p.The City's excitement about the deal marks a step change in its attitude to biotech. But, alone, it will not be a sufficient cure for the industry's deep-rooted malaise.Alan Kingsman, the chief executive of Oxford BioMedica, which develops gene-based medicines, is certain that the sector will recover. 'We all expect it to turn around in the UK - we have lived through downturns before,' he says.But why should institutions invest in loss-making companies that may never score a success in the clinic? The answer is not straightforward.Without speculative equity financing, Britain's scientists would be unable to fund new drugs discoveries - so a great deal is at stake. But investors need a degree of assurance that they stand to make a return on their investment.Here lies the problem. Biotechnology is, by its very nature, a hit-and-miss business. It takes at least 10 years for successful discoveries to move into profitability, if they are capable of being developed into marketable products.Kingsman is passionate in his belief that biotech companies deserve a place on the stock market because otherwise they would have limited access to much-needed cash.'It would be outrageous if the UK, with its scientific excellence in biological science, did not have a flourishing biotech sector, generating wealth for the economy and health for the nation,' he says.Kingsman has particular reasons for arguing in favour of equity financing. Oxford BioMedica, which was set up in 1996, is loss-making and has two promising cancer treatments in the clinic.MetXia, a gene-based cancer treatment, developed by the company, which improves the efficacy of chemotherapy in the treatment of tumours, has completed early stage trials and late-stage studies are planned for 2004.'We have had very good results with MetXia,' he says. 'We had a lady with an awful lesion on her shoulder and during the course of the trial there was very substantial improvement. The product met all the goals'.He is similarly optimistic about TroVax, a cancer vaccine designed to stimulate the body's immune system to destroy a tumour.All 18 patients in the recent early-stage trial developed an anti-tumour immune response. Kingsman says: 'This is remarkable for this type of product. People have been trying to develop [a cancer vaccine] for many, many years and we have seen clinical benefit'.While Kingsman is hopeful that his drugs will work, he is keen to stress that good early stage results do not necessarily guarantee success.'I can't conclude from this that TroVax is definitely going to work because the number of patients is too small to draw a firm conclusion.'The problem for Kingsman is that he is running out of cash. Oxford BioMedica has the resources to fund the next phase of trials, but it will not be able to proceed to the final evaluations unless it can attract further investment.Despite his earlier assertion that biotech companies are valid as listed entities, Kingsman doubts that he could raise the funds he needs in the market.Only two companies - Antisoma and Xenova - have launched successful rights issues this year. Meanwhile, one biotech company, Ark Therapeutics, was forced to abandon its flotation plans in May, proving just how tough market conditions remain.Kingsman is keen to explore other options, although he is slightly sceptical about doing a deal with one of the big pharmaceutical companies.'We could do a deal with a major pharmaceutical company, and we are talking to people, but the industry is very reluctant to spend money. It is in a bit of a state. Its cash consumption has rocketed and its number of product registrations has gone down.'He is concerned that the big drug companies are playing a waiting game in an attempt to pick up companies with products showing promise in the clinic on the cheap, when those companies run out of cash.So Kingsman has to consider merging with a company that has plenty of money but is short of products.A number of companies fall into this category. British Biotech, with £50m in the bank but whose name was tarnished by allegations that it misled the market over the potential of one of its cancer drugs in the late 90s, is one contender.It recently ousted Elliott Goldstein, the chief executive, after talks to merge with MorphoSys of Germany collapsed. Tim Edwards, Goldstein's replacement, might be attracted by a link with Oxford BioMedica.Oxford Glycosciences is another potential candidate for Kingsman. It is thought to have a cash pile of about £100m and David Ebsworth, the chief executive, wants to play an active role in industry consolidation.Ebsworth is especially keen to build his company's expertise in oncology, or cancer treatment. 'We want to carry out deals [in the oncology area] as we do not have anything in the clinic,' he says.Unlike many UK biotechs, who look to the more mature US sector for partnerships and collaborations, Ebsworth is looking in the UK and continental Europe for his cancer partner. So a deal with Oxford BioMedica would be a logical step.Given that the sector is a muddle of cash-rich and product-poor companies, consolidation seems inevitable.Charles Spicer, the head of healthcare corporate finance at Nomura, says: 'There will be M&A, but it is frustrating because biotech CEOs have a tendency to want to row their own boat. There is also a strange problem that cash-rich companies are so badly valued that it is hard for them to negotiate with well-valued companies.'Edwards believes the entire industry has to reposition itself in terms of how it communicates with the public and with investors before any real progress can be made.He says: 'It will have to demonstrate that it can follow certain rules. Companies will have to be very clear about the data they produce and they will have to kill programmes that are not being fulfilled.'"
telegraph,9/7/2007 0:01,news," Professor Dame Anne Mclaren, who died on Saturday aged 80 in the same car accident that killed her former husband, Donald Michie, was a leading authority on mammalian genetics and helped to develop the techniques that led to human in vitro fertilisation (IVF).         In 1991 she became the first woman in the Royal Society's 300-year history to be appointed its Foreign Secretary, and she went on to become the third woman to serve as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.         In her career as a scientist Anne McLaren used laboratory mice to elucidate what she described as 'everything involved in getting from one generation to the next', but always with a view to its relevance to human welfare.         Her research included areas of fundamental importance, such as egg transfer, hormonal control of ovulation, placental and foetal growth, and interactions between embryo and uterus during implantation.          Her early work contributed towards the development of new contraceptive methods that have improved the choice available for family planning.         In 1958, working with John Biggers at University College London, she achieved the first successful birth of mice that had been grown outside the mother's body for 24 hours as early embryos.          This achievement represented a huge leap in understanding of reproductive mechanisms and eventually to the birth of the world's first test-tube baby in 1978.         Her later research, at the Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Institute in Cambridge, focused on the development of mouse primordial germ cells - the embryonic cells from which eggs and sperm derive.          By understanding and eventually manipulating the factors that give rise to sex differentiation, she hoped to generate new tools which, applied to stem cells, might enable scientists to build replacements for human cells damaged by disease or injury in, for example, Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease.         It was all extremely tricky ethical territory, and Anne McLaren became deeply involved in helping to define the ethical and legal implications of new developments in genetics.          She was a member of the Warnock Committee which laid the groundwork for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of 1990, as well as for parts of the Family Law Reform Act of 1987, and she played a leading role in establishing the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, on which she served for 10 years.         She believed that if scientists were open and informative about the purposes of their research, they could trust the public's judgment about its ethical implications.         Her commitment to public debate, however, sometimes seemed at odds with her own instinct for self-effacement. She never used the titles 'Dame' or 'Professor', though entitled to do so, preferring to be known simply as 'Dr'.          Though clear and forthright in a scientific environment, her natural shyness and sense of privacy made her a hesitant interviewee, responding to conversations rather than initiating them.         These personal qualities endeared her to research students, whom she provided with unstinting support without invading their privacy.          Though intolerant of sloppy thinking, she encouraged her students to follow where the science led, even if she herself thought it unpromising, and was not one of those academics who automatically append their names to their research students' papers.         A mother herself, she always ticked off married students she found working late in the laboratory, insisting that they should spend their evenings at home with their families.         Anne Laura Dorinthea McLaren was born on April 26 1927, the daughter of Henry McLaren, second Lord Aberconway, and his wife Christabel. The Aberconway family were industrial magnates known for their devotion to Liberal politics and women's suffrage.          Anne's father had served as an MP and was the creator of the famous gardens at Bodnant in north Wales. Her great-grandfather was an inventor who, by designing a method of clarifying rosin, found a way to make pink and white soap.         Anne spent her childhood between the family's homes in London and Bodnant and was educated at Longstow Hall, Cambridgeshire.          Initially she wanted to study English Literature at Oxford, but found the entrance papers too difficult and decided on Zoology instead. After two terms at an Oxford crammer, she won a scholarship to Lady Margaret Hall.         As an undergraduate Anne McLaren was taught by the zoologists Alister Hardy and Willy Holmes; but it was her tutor, the geneticist E B Ford, who stirred her interest in genetics and evolution.          After graduation she embarked on postgraduate research in J B S Haldane's laboratory at University College London on the infestation of drosophila with mites. As a result she became the first woman to win a Christopher Welch scholarship and this, together with MRC funding, enabled her to go on to do a doctorate.          After a false start working, under the supervision of Peter Medawar, on the inheritance of acquired characteristics in rabbits (there were not enough rabbits to continue with experiments) she worked under Kingsley Sanders on neurotropic viruses in the mouse.         In 1952, after obtaining her doctorate, Anne McLaren married a fellow student, Donald Michie. The couple worked together at UCL under Medawar, and, from 1955, at the Royal Veterinary College, on the variation in the number of lumbar vertebrae in mice as a function of the maternal environment.         They had three children, but the marriage was dissolved in 1959. The pressures of pursuing a career and providing her children with a stable and happy home environment led Anne McLaren to become a strong advocate of more government assistance towards childcare.         After her divorce she moved to the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh, where she spent the next 15 years studying various aspects of fertility, development and genetics in mice, initially under Professor Conrad Hal Waddington.          In the 1960s and early 1970s her research included work, with Alan Beatty, on immuno-contraception; on DNA hybridisation with Peter Walker; and on chimeras, collaborating with Hans Grüneberg in investigating skeletal characteristics.         In 1974 she left Edinburgh to become director of the MRC Mammalian Development Unit at UCL, where she remained for 18 years until her official retirement. She was then appointed Principal Research Associate at the Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute in Cambridge and a research fellow of King's College, Cambridge.         During her research career, Anne McLaren published more than 300 scientific papers. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1975 and awarded one of the society's Royal medals in 1990. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1986.         She was Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society from 1991 to 1996; president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1993-94; and Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution from 1992 to 1996.         In 2001 she won a Unesco award for women in science and the next year was awarded the Japan Prize, with Andrzej K Tarkowski, for her contributions to developmental biology. Well known for her work to promote more women in science, she was also president of the Association for Women in Science and Engineering.         She was appointed DBE in 1993.         Anne McLaren is survived by her son - Jonathan Michie, Professor of Management and Director of the Business School at Birmingham University - and her two daughters."
telegraph,26/06/2007 00:01,news,"                                             Embryonic stem cells explained                                             Human-animal hybrid embryos conceived in the laboratory - so-called “chimeras” - should be regarded as human and their mothers should be allowed to give birth to them, the Roman Catholic Church said yesterday.          Under draft Government legislation to be debated by Parliament later this year, scientists will be given permission for the first time to create such embryos for research as long as they destroy them within two weeks.         But the Catholic bishops of England and Wales, in a submission to the Parliamentary joint committee scrutinising the draft legislation, said that the genetic mothers of “chimeras” should be able to raise them as their own children if they wished.          The bishops said that they did not see why these “interspecies” embryos should be treated any differently than others.         The wide-ranging draft Human Tissue and Embryo Bill, which aims to overhaul the laws on fertility treatment, will include sections on test tube babies, embryo research and abortion. Ministers say that the creation of animal-human embryos - created by injecting animal cells or DNA into human embryos or human cells into animal eggs - will be heavily regulated.         They insist that it will be against the law to implant “chimeras” - named after the mythical creature that was half man and half animal - into a woman’s womb.         The bishops, who believe that life begins at conception, said that they opposed the creation of any embryo solely for research, but they were also anxious to limit the destruction of such life once it had been brought into existence.         In their submission to the committee, they said: “At the very least, embryos with a preponderance of human genes should be assumed to be embryonic human beings, and should be treated accordingly.         “In particular, it should not be a crime to transfer them, or other human embryos, to the body of the woman providing the ovum, in cases where a human ovum has been used to create them.         “Such a woman is the genetic mother, or partial mother, of the embryo; should she have a change of heart and wish to carry her child to term, she should not be prevented from doing so.”         The draft Bill will also allow the screening of embryos for genetic or chromosomal abnormalities that might lead to serious medical conditions, disabilities, or miscarriage. It will permit doctors to check whether an embryo could provide a suitable tissue match for a sibling suffering from a life-threatening illness.          The Bill would abolish the requirement for fertility clinics to consider the need for a father when deciding on treatment. This means clinics will no longer be able to deny treatment to lesbians and single mothers.          The Catholic bishops said that most of the procedures covered by the Bill “should not be licensed under any circumstances”, principally on the grounds that they violate human rights."
telegraph,22/04/2008 00:01,news,"            A global food shortage threatens the lives of millions. Charles Clover reports on the possible solutions to the crisis                  The era of cheap food is over. In Britain, a standard white loaf costs more than £1, grocery bills are driving up inflation and land prices are going through the roof. But steep rises in the price of staples such as wheat and rice are having an even bigger impact on poor countries.          In Cameroon, 24 people have been killed in food riots since February, while in Haiti, protesters chanting, 'We're hungry' forced the prime minister to resign this month.         In the past month, there have been food riots in Egypt, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Madagascar.          The World Bank now believes that some 33 countries are in danger of being destabilised by food price inflation, while Ban Ki-Moon, the UN secretary-general, said that higher food prices risked wiping out progress towards reducing poverty and could harm global growth and security.         Why has this happened so quickly? Can science and technology get us out of the hole we appear to be in.         WHAT CAUSED THE PRICE RISES?         Bob Watson, the chief scientist at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, puts the rise in the price of commodity crops such as wheat down to a number of factors: higher demand for grain to feed livestock in China, where increasing affluence means more people want to eat meat; drought in Australia for three years, meaning it has had to import wheat; market jitters brought on by the sight of several countries stopping exporting grain; speculators seeing a chance to make money; and, of course, the sudden extra demand for food crops such as maize for use in biofuels, in both Europe and the United States.          A few years ago, he points out, no one could have predicted that we would be aiming to produce five to 10 per cent of our petrol and diesel from crops.         WHY SHOULD THE PRICE OF RICE HAVE GONE UP, TOO?         Since January 2007, the price of wheat has risen by as much as two and a half times, while the rice price has almost trebled.          This, says the International Rice Research Institute, is partly because rice-growing land in countries such as the Philippines is being lost to industrialisation and urbanisation, while the growing appetite for meat and dairy products among Asia's burgeoning middle class is leading farmers to abandon rice growing. Flooding in Indonesia and Bangladesh and cold weather in Vietnam and China have also hit production.         WHO IS WORST AFFECTED?         Food price inflation inevitably hits the poor hardest. Food represents about 10 to 20 per cent of consumer spending in the rich world, but as much as 60 to 80 per cent in developing countries, many of which are net food importers, according to Henri Josserand, of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.          Bob Zoellick, president of the World Bank, calculates that food inflation could push 100?million people back into poverty, wiping out the gains of a decade of economic growth.          The World Food Programme has warned that we could be living in a world of food supply imbalances until 2010 at least.         WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?         In the short term, farmers in the developed world are likely to be attracted by high prices and try to grow more staple crops. In Europe, Brussels has abolished set-aside, the practice of paying farmers to leave land fallow, and the signs are that Europe's farmers will grow 13 per cent more cereals this year.          In the developing world, things are less certain, because the poorest in Africa and India have been selling their tools, their animals and the sheets of tin over their heads just to buy food.          For the poorest, recovery is more difficult and aid will be needed. The balance will eventually be restored - nearly half of the world's potential agricultural land is unused.         CAN'T TECHNOLOGY HELP?         The development of better crop varieties, pesticides and fertilisers has kept the world's food supply growing faster than its population, even though the latter figure is set to hit nine billion by 2050.          However, the rate of progress has slowed. According to Dr Watson, who chaired the four-year International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), enormous improvements have been made in productivity, particularly in Asia, but food production in sub-Saharan Africa has decreased. More than 800million people still go hungry at night and, even in India, where the Green Revolution made some of its biggest strides, some 50 per cent of children in rural areas are malnourished.         COULD GM FOOD SAVE US?         To the exasperation of the big agroscience companies, and countries such as the United States, Australia and Canada, the 2,500-page IAASTD report, backed by the World Bank and UN, did not push for big technical fixes.          It came down on the side of 'multi-functional' agriculture, which incorporates goals such as poverty reduction, water conservation and climate change adaptation alongside conventional efforts to increase production.          It said that the biggest gains will come not from new 'miracle crops', but from making existing science and technology available to the small-scale farmers responsible for tilling a third of the world's land surface.          Only by helping them to feed themselves - partly by improving distribution and markets - will the challenges of sustainability, better health and poverty reduction be met.         WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE BIOTECHNOLOGY?         Partly in the cold. Biotechnology, in the sense of rapid development of plant varieties, will play a central role in feeding the world this century, says Dr Watson.          But whether transgenic crops and animals - those that have had genes inserted into them - have increased productivity at all is open for debate. Technologies such as high-yielding crops, agrochemicals and mechanisation have mostly helped the better-off.          With the right controls, he says, biotechnology could contribute to greater food production - but he adds that some forms of organic agriculture have a part to play in feeding the poor.          This has led to criticism from the US and other countries, who take a simpler view of GM crops. Sixty countries have endorsed the report. Britain, typically, has yet to decide.         SO, WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT BIOFUELS?         Watson's lot say using food crops for fuel is environmentally, socially and economically unacceptable. Some would argue that using maize for fuel achieves a 50 per cent reduction in carbon emissions once the fossil fuels used to make them are taken into account.          Others argue that there could be an increase in the greenhouse gases produced, because of the displacement of soya crops from the US into Brazil, where they are grown on land cleared from the forest and where livestock is then displaced on to forest land, which has led to a new peak in its destruction.         ARE ALL BIOFUELS EQUALLY BAD?         Some first-generation biofuels, such as sugar cane, look pretty good, according to Watson. Brazil has some 500 commercial varieties and, arguably, sugar cane does not displace livestock into the rainforest.          Everyone is agreed that the role for science and technology is to bring forward second-generation biofuels - using enzymes to break down cellulose in woody crops such as switchgrass and miscanthus, and farm wastes such as straw.          There are other plans to use plain domestic rubbish. Then there are third-generation biofuels such as algae and bacteria. Watson is pessimistic, believing that it will take five to 15 years for the first second-generation biofuels to become available in sufficient quantities.          In the meantime, Europe and America's targets for including more biofuels in what is sold on the forecourt will place greater pressure on food crops.         IS THERE A SILVER LINING?         The good news, believe experts such as Richard Murphy, a reader in plant science at Imperial College London, is that fuels made from wastes and woody crops grown on marginal land should eventually beat fuels made from food crops on price.          Cellulose breakdown, he points out, happens on the forest floor every day, thanks to the work of fungi and termites. If we could crack it on a large scale, it would make fuel from waste and woody crops as 'cheap as chips' - and the continent capable of growing the largest quantities of woody crops is Africa.          So the solutions to the present crisis may, in the end, help fight poverty and save the planet at the same time."
telegraph,29/09/2004 00:01,technology,"            A project to combat climate change is seeking to enhance the life-giving properties of the Earth's smallest creatures. Roger Highfield reports                   The Earth's atmosphere is so polluted that the planet is dying. But scientists around the world hatch a plan, one that offers a tantalising last-ditch hope: they ask for vast amounts of funding so that they can enlist some of the smallest creatures to renew the atmosphere and save all of humanity.          The proposal for a Hollywood sci-fi movie? No. This idea is under serious discussion. The US has already spent around $100 million to curb climate change by giving the Earth a new set of 'lungs'.          The lungs would consist of vast colonies of bacteria and other microbes that are able to scrub the atmosphere of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. As a bonus, they may even convert the pollutants to ethanol, which can be used as a fuel.          Last year, Spencer Abraham, the US Secretary of Energy, said he envisaged 'a colony of specially designed microbes living within the emission-control system of a coal-fired plant, consuming its pollution and its carbon dioxide'.          Others go even further. Dr Ari Patrinos, director of the US Department of Energy's biological and environmental research programme, is confident that microbes – and their extraordinary biochemistry – are up to the job of altering the atmosphere of the planet.          After all, we owe the oxygen in the air we breathe to a microbial pollution incident more than two billion years ago. These microbes had to dump oxygen to avoid being poisoned so this 'oxygen waste' became part of our atmosphere. 'Microbes have perfected many processes and, compared with them, we are neophytes,' said Dr Patrinos. 'They are marvels of efficiency.'          After four billion years of evolution, microbes now make up 60 per cent of the mass of living material on the planet. Each of us relies on several pounds - consisting of many thousands of species - in our gut to digest food. Trees breathe in carbon dioxide thanks to microbial colonies. The same goes for the oceans, said Dr Patrinos.          He concedes that the idea of persuading the planet's microbial lungs to take deeper breaths sounds 'too science fiction and far- fetched'. But Dr Patrinos stresses that the current focus of the 'Genomes to Life' project is in basic research: to understand how living things manage their astonishing metabolic feats.          Earlier this year, the US DoE brought together 80 scientists to discuss the plan, the outline of which is straightforward. Read the entire genetic codes - genomes - of microbes, trees and thousands of other creatures that deal with pollution, whether carbon dioxide, radionuclides or heavy metals. Then see if there is a way to harness them or their clever chemistry in clean-ups or even design one from scratch.          One of those present at the Washington meeting was Prof Jeremy Nicholson of Imperial College London, an expert at teasing apart the complex interactions between communities of cells. He felt as if he was 'part of a science-fiction movie', but added it was 'a most exciting and challenging scientific experience'.          'US scientists have probably hit on an idea that may just be practical,' he said. Although many believe that the Kyoto agreement to curb greenhouse gases is a start, there is scepticism about it preventing global warming, given rising fossil fuel use by developing countries.          Time is now running out. 'Some US scientists think we may have only about 30-40 years to find ways to develop a practical solution – otherwise we could have a catastrophic climate within a few generations beyond,' said Prof Nicholson.          Many creatures that could curb climate change are under study. Some are involved in cycling of the greenhouse gas methane. Last week saw the publication of the first complete genetic code of Methylococcus capsulatus by Dr Naomi Ward of the Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, Maryland, in the journal PLoS Biology.          Many others cycle carbon, such as Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a soil bug that converts carbon dioxide into cell material, nitrogen gas into ammonia and can make hydrogen. Other targets of the project are Nitrosomonas europaea and Nostoc punctiforme, which also take part in nitrogen fixation.          Of the many marine microbes, a diatom called Thalassiosira pseudonana plays a role in transferring carbon to the ocean depths. Others of interest include Prochlorococcus marinus, the most abundant photosynthetic organism in the oceans.          A study of this microbe by Prof Jim Barber at Imperial College London is helping to show how it influences carbon dioxide levels. 'What factors influence this bacterium's ability to regulate carbon dioxide is crucial for humans' continued survival,' he said.          And there is interest in the genetic codes of creatures that play host to the microbes. Dr Patrinos was particularly proud to announce that his team had cracked another genome, that of the poplar tree.          'Understanding the genetics of the poplar will help us focus on the microbial communities around its roots in its rhizosphere,' he said. This understanding could help them to absorb more carbon. 'A few small percentage improvements in the storage of carbon in the roots of these plants can make a huge dent in the carbon loading in the atmosphere because this plant is so ubiquitous.'          Perhaps the most extraordinary project of all being backed by Dr Patrinos is being led by Dr Craig Venter, the controversial former head of the private effort to read the human genetic code (notably his own) along with other species (such as his poodle, Shadow).          At the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives, Rockville, Maryland, Dr Venter has been working on the creation of a microbe with the minimum number of genes to survive, which could lead to the creation of artificial organisms to turn carbon dioxide to ethanol, or help make hydrogen fuel.          An effort to re-engineer the way that the Earth cycles greenhouse gases 'could be the world's most ambitious and scary science project – literally to re-terraform our planet's atmosphere, using a giant microbial supercolony', said Prof Nicholson. The ultimate projected cost could be 100 times greater than that involved in putting man on the Moon.          The lungs might have to be capable of capturing from the atmosphere 300 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, much more than could be achieved with Kyoto. 'You might need billions of tons of bugs to do this,' said Prof Nicholson.           'The question of what will happen to all this 'fixed' carbon is unclear,' he added. 'At this scale, you would probably need to use communities of self-regulating, interacting organisms, as you could not maintain a monoculture on this vast scale for very long – and, again, this poses huge technical problems.'          The communities that make up the lungs could be concentrated in mines, deep aquifers or deserts. Perhaps soil microbes could be persuaded to hang on to more carbon. Ditto those in the world's oceans.          There are concerns that this work will pave the way to a vast, uncontrolled experiment with GM microbes. Dr Patrinos said: 'We may have contemplated something like that in the early days, but find that nature is already doing certain things very well, thank you very much, and it is just a matter of helping her along without necessarily manipulating her genetically. That is my conviction.          'Regardless of the endless wrangling over Kyoto, nobody will dispute the need for better technology,' he said. The Genomes to Life programme 'is a no brainer'.           The initiative, though potentially useful, could divert resources from more pressing issues, commented Dr Keith Tovey, a carbon reduction expert at the University of East Anglia. 'I would say it would take 20 years or more before this would become viable and make the substantive reductions in carbon dioxide needed,' said Dr Tovey.          'It is a high-tech fix, which is diverting us away from some of the hard issues we ought to be addressing now, such as energy conservation and deploying renewables.'          Prof Nicholson is worried about diversions of a different kind. If America launches a vast programme in his field, it could destabilise related research in Europe: 'We might see a brain drain and the direct commercial spin-offs to the US as a result of these programmes will almost certainly be counted in billions or even trillions of dollars during the next century – this is where big investment in the science of very small things could have very big rewards, as well as saving the planet.'

telegraph,8/3/2007 0:01,news,"            A systematic attempt to find tumour genes bears fruit, says Roger Highfield                   Scientists have found more than 100 new genes linked with cancer in the first major systematic hunt through cancer cells for faulty DNA.          The search through a fraction of the entire human genetic makeup, or genome, will provide new targets for anti-tumour drugs, will help establish what caused a cancer, whether inheritance, sunbathing or exposure to chemicals and will speed the development of tests to diagnose cancer earlier.          The survey published today in the journal Nature, is hailed as the first milestone of a £10 million survey launched in 1999 that is the broadest yet to link DNA abnormalities with the way cells multiply out of control to more than 500 human genes with 200 cancers.          However, there is still a long way to go. The team has looked at 500 of 25,000 human genes and only focused on single letter DNA 'spelling mistakes'.          'The human genome is a vast place and this, our first deep systematic exploration in cancer, has thrown up many surprises', said Professor Mike Stratton, co-leader of the international Cancer Genome Project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, near Cambridge.           There was a wide variation in the numbers of mutations linked with cancers, with some malignant cells - such as from testicular cancer - containing surprisingly few, and some were in patterns not encountered before that are thought to be linked to exposure to agents that damage DNA. Patterns of mutations were likened by Prof Stratton to an 'archaeological record written into the DNA of each cancer' that can reveal the factors that caused the cancer in the first place, which were often active many decades previously.          Some of the patterns can be deciphered, such as the signatures of damage from ultraviolet radiation (sunlight) or cancer-causing chemicals in tobacco, but others are cryptic and will require decoding in the future.When a human cell becomes cancerous, it multiplies and divides out of control and a large number of genes are involved. The 1000 mutations uncovered by the survey in cancers can be divided into drivers or passengers, where only the former cause cancer cells to grow.          The team identified possible driver mutations in 120 genes, 100 of which had not been seen before - ten times more than expected. 'We have found a much larger number of mutated driver mutations produced by a wider range of forces than we expected. However, these are buried among many passenger mutations, which have just hitchhiked along for the ride' said Prof Stratton.          'This suggests that many more genes contribute to cancer development than was previously thought,' explained Dr Andy Futreal, co-leader of the Cancer Genome Project.   Because it is not yet practical to survey the entire genetic make up of each individual cancer type, the team focused more than 500 genes of a type called kinases, some of which have been previously implicated in causing cancers. Kinases can act as a series of molecular switches, turning on and off in our cells, in networks of activity that control cell behaviour, such as cell division, which goes awry in cancer.  One example is the BRAF gene: the 2002 pilot phase of the team's work showed that BRAF was mutated in more than 60% of cases of malignant melanoma.          That observation has driven discovery of new drugs to treat melanoma, some of which are in clinical trials.          The current study was much broader and included breast, lung, colorectal and stomach cancers, which are the most common cancer types.         Dr Futreal explains: 'For example, we found that a group of kinases involved in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor signalling pathway was hit much more than we expected, particularly in colorectal cancers.'"
telegraph,9/5/2007 14:01,news,"            And restore the plumbing of much more besides, reports Roger Highfield                  One day soon it should be possible to inject cells that can grow into new blood vessels to nourish an ailing heart, or help restore circulation in a leg that would otherwise have to be amputated.           These are some of the possibilities raised by the discovery and isolation of special a class of stem cells from human embryos, called hemangioblast cells, which can repair blood vessels, according to tests on animals published today.         American scientists now plan to apply next year for their use to treat diabetics, victims of heart attacks and others where new blood vessels are needed to repair the body.           However, the team believes the work has broader implications because it may be possible to use the cells to 'educate' the body's immune system that will tolerate laboratory grown cells used for repair. This would do away with the need to use cloning methods, which would rely on a vast supply of human eggs, to grow a patient's own stem cells to carry out repairs, so that lines of lab grown cells can be used instead.           The new opportunities arise because scientists have found a way to grow billions of 'hemangioblasts' in the laboratory, the stem cells that give rise to our entire blood and immune system as well to the blood vessels in our body, a class of adult stem cell that, though suggested more than a century ago, has not been described in the literature until now.           In the journal Nature Methods the company Advanced Cell Technology and its collaborators in Florida and New York describe an efficient method for generating large numbers of hemangioblasts from human embryonic cells that are capable of turning into blood vessels as well as into all blood and immune cells.           'The ability to repair vascular damage using these cells could have a profound impact on a large number of diseases that are major human afflictions,' said Dr Robert Lanza, Vice President of Research & Scientific Development at ACT, and senior author.         'Our results suggest the possibility of using nature's early cellular developmental components to restore vascularisation and function in patients with vascular disease. An injection of some of these cells might potentially be able to prevent a patient from having a leg amputated or a patient from dying after a heart attack.'           In the tests on animals the cells ' show an amazing ability to repair vascular damage in animals,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 'They could provide a therapeutically invaluable source of cells for vascular restoration of organs and limbs - in fact, we're planning to file with the Food and Drug Administration next year to use them in patients.'           'We also have studies under way indicating that the cells can also considerably accelerate wound healing, repair lung damage, and can even generate unlimited amounts of red blood cells for transfusion. We might also be able to use them to treat strokes, complications of diabetes (when tiny blood vessels become blocked), and possibly even reverse the progression of atherosclerosis, the furring of blood vessels.'           The use of the cells in treatments is made possible because the team has developed for the first time a simple and easy to scale up source of human hemangioblasts, added Dr Shi-Jiang Lu, first author. Because the human cells could be grown without the need for animal products, and in large quantities, they 'will be important for future preclinical and human studies,' said Dr Lu.           When the cells were injected into animals that had damage to their retina due to diabetes or lack of adequate blood flow, they homed to the site of injury and repaired the damaged plumbing within 24-48 hours.         'When injected into the bloodstream of mice with damaged retinas due to diabetes or other eye injury, they homed to the other side of the body and repaired the damaged vasculature within a few days. The cells are really smart, and amazingly, knew not to do anything in uninjured eyes,' said Dr Lanza.           The cells showed a similar regenerative capacity in animal models of heart attacks, caused when the cardiac blood supply is cut off, halving the mortality rate. And, where blood flow had been restricted to a hind limb, were able to restore flow to near normal levels within about a month.           'These cells were able to generate functional blood vessels in the presence of severe tissue injury as well as in chronic disease states' added coauthor Prof Maria Grant at the University of Florida. 'These cells have a robust vascular reparative ability under what is typically considered very adverse growth conditions making them potentially ideal for treatment of diabetic vascular complications where profound tissue compromise exists and healing is typically severely compromised.'         The researchers of the paper from Advanced Cell Technology collaborated with scientists from the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre, New York, New York."
telegraph,5/2/2008 0:01,news,"            At last week's annual party for scientists and the press, the two tribes traded theories, gossip - and played an experimental game of darts. Nic Fleming reports                                                               Scientists' predictions for 2008                                                                        Darts science experiment                                                                        In pictures: The Daily Telegraph - scientists meet the media party                                             Like soldiers temporarily leaving their opposing trenches for a kickabout on Christmas Day, mutual mistrust was put aside and a temporary ceasefire declared for one night last week, as scientists and journalists converged at the Royal Society, off Pall Mall, for the Scientists Meet the Media party, organised by The Daily Telegraph and Novartis.         Lord Rees, the Astronomer Royal and president of the Royal Society described how Wednesday's event 'brought together two species that do not mix easily - the nerds and the reptiles', adding that the gathering would certainly have met with the approval of one of the Society's founders, Samuel Pepys.         Prof Jim Al-Khalili, the nuclear physicist from Surrey University, had kicked off the proceedings in a suitably high-brow manner earlier in the evening, with the 2008 Michael Faraday Prize Lecture.          His controversial thesis was that Charles Darwin was beaten to the evolutionary punch by Abu Uthman al-Jahith, an intellectual living in Baghdad who speculated about the influence of the environment on species during the 8th century.          His eloquent discourse caused several brows to furrow with scepticism, including that of botanist Sarah Darwin, a relative, and Sir David Attenborough.         Sir David, whose latest series Life in Cold Blood began on BBC1 yesterday, momentarily freed himself from the crowd of mainly female admirers jostling for his attention to issue a challenge to aspiring natural history film makers. 'There is just one big prize left,' he said. 'The filming of the giant squid at depth. That is a film I would really like to see.'
