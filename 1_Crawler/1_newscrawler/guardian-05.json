Recent reminders include the 1995 volcanic eruption on Montserrat, and the devastating magnitude 7 earthquake that struck Haiti in January 2010. Occasionally the Caribbean produces even more powerful outbursts. Back in February 1843 the region was shaken by an estimated magnitude 8.3 quake, reducing Pointe-a-Pitre in Guadeloupe to ruins and killing one third (1,500) of its inhabitants. Meanwhile, 2,000 people are thought to have perished in a quake of unspecified magnitude which shook Jamaica in 1692. So when will the Caribbean\u2019s next major rumble be? This month scientists aboard a research ship \u2013 the RRS James Cook \u2013 will be taking measurements to try to gain some early warning clues . Led by Jenny Collier of Imperial College London, they will be following the seawater that is drawn down into the Earth east of the Caribbean islands, where the oceanic plate dives underground. Using seismic reflections and sensitive recording devices on the seafloor, the scientists will see if they can spot where water comes into the system and how this affects the surrounding geology. \u201cWater is a key component in causing the mantle to melt, which eventually forms magma at shallower depths, causing potentially hazardous volcanoes,\u201d explains Stephen Hicks from the University of Southampton. \u201cIt may also lubricate or increase the pressure along titanic faults that have the potential to cause huge earthquakes.\u201d By tracking the movement of water, down to hundreds of miles depth, they hope to better understand what causes the build-up of magma in some places, and why some parts of the plate boundary produce more earthquakes than others.

Effective darkness at the latitude of Manchester lasts for about 6 hours at present, but halves to barely 3 hours at the month\u2019s end, by which time night-long twilight bathes most of Scotland. The S sky at nightfall is dominated by Jupiter and, 30\u00b0 higher and to its left, Arcturus in Bootes. The latter is the brightest star in the sky\u2019s N hemisphere, being only just brighter than Vega in Lyra, climbing in the E, and Capella in Auriga, sinking in the NW. Outshining every star, Jupiter remains our most conspicuous planet as it tracks from about 30\u00b0 high at nightfall to set in the W shortly before dawn. Above and to the right of Spica, and moving slowly to the WNW against the stars of Virgo, it fades a little from mag \u20132.4 to \u20132.2 as it recedes from 678 million to 724 million km. Catch Jupiter just below the Moon on the 7th when a telescope shows its disc to be 43 arcsec wide and, since it is polar-flattened by its rapid rotation, 40 arcsec high. Its four main moons are easy through any telescope and may be glimpsed through binoculars. Venus is brighter at mag \u20134.5 to \u20134.3 but hangs low above our E horizon in the dawn twilight. It rises less than 90 minutes before the Sun, and shows a dazzling crescent through a telescope, shrinking from 38 to 25 arcsec in diameter as its phase grows from 27% to 48% sunlit. It stands left of the waning Moon on the 22nd. Mercury is too low in the dawn twilight to be seen from Britain though both it and Venus are well placed as morning stars for watchers in the S hemisphere. Saturn now rises in the SE in the middle of the night and is bright (mag 0.3 to 0.1) but low in our S sky before dawn. It lies above-right of the Teapot asterism as it edges westwards from Sagittarius to Ophiuchus. When Saturn is close to the Moon before dawn on the 14th, a telescope shows its globe to be 18 arcsec wide while its glorious rings span 41 arcsec and have their N face inclined 26\u00b0 towards the Earth. Mars, currently mag 1.6 and above-right of Aldebaran, is destined to be swallowed by our NW evening twilight this month as it tracks between the horns of Taurus.", "author": "", "lang": "en"},

In some cases, this is literally true, not just the hawthorn hedges, which are fattening up with fresh leaves and blossom, but also the jackdaws , whichjourney back and forth with great gobbets of moss and cattle hair in their beaks. Some are so front-loaded with construction materials that one wonders how they see to navigate. Corvids are generally great architects, and once the instinct has been unleashed it is remarkable how lavish their designs can be. The standard rook nest is a rough 15cm-deep stick platform, but recently I have come across some where the foundations are in a deeply forked situation. They have gone on until these twisting columns of sticks, which are known as \u201ccastles\u201d\u2019, are more than a metre tall. In his book Birds and Man , WH Hudson tells a great story about cathedral-going jackdaws at Wells, Somerset. He claimed that some of them were hoisting up two-metre sticks and then dropping them, only to return and start again. Much as I love the man I find it hard to believe that the bird could manage what would be a relative tree trunk for the species. Yet it is certainly true that one belfry-dwelling jackdaw pair in Gloucestershire assembled a nest that was 2.5 metres in height and diameter. More moving still are the ways in which birds can develop their building works through time. There are gyr falcons in Greenland whose nests have been renewed for so long that they have massive guano deposits in the footings. The carbon dating of some of this debris suggests that the oldest have been continuously occupied for 2,500 years. Occasionally this avian fidelity to place acquires cultural significance. There is a steep cliff ledge in Cressbrook Dale, Derbyshire, called Ravencliffe Cave , presumably for its long occupancy. When ravens returned to the region after a manmade absence of more than a century and a half, among the first sites that they nested was on the old ledge named after their ancestors.

Former cabinet ministers, senior foreign policy advisers and diplomats warned the Foreign Office against relying too heavily on the US president and urged the UK to completely redraw its approach to the region. Calling on Britain to forge new alliances in the Gulf region, the Lords international relations select committee described Britain\u2019s policy in Syria as being in \u201cconfusion and disarray\u201d and suggested influence with Iran and Saudi Arabia had dwindled. The report concluded Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, should support the Iran nuclear deal , loathed by the Trump White House, and seriously consider recognising Palestine as a state in order to boost the Middle East peace process. \u201cThe mercurial and unpredictable nature of policymaking by President Trump has made it challenging for the UK government to influence US foreign policy so far, a challenge that is not likely to ease,\u201d the committee said. The group is chaired by the former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Howell and includes former foreign policy advisers to William Hague and Gordon Brown, the former UK ambassador to the UN Lord Hannay, and the former Labour defence secretary Lord Reid. \u201cIn a world less automatically dominated by the US underpinning security in the region, it is no longer right to have a stance at every stage of \u2018if we just get on with the US everything will be alright\u2019,\u201d Howell said. He described the US as \u201cthe wild card\u201d, and said: \u201cWe really have to think for ourselves.\u201d He added: \u201cThe Middle East has changed and UK policy in the region must respond to that. As the UK prepares to leave the EU, and we have a new and uncertain American policy in the region, we cannot assume our strategies of the past will suffice. \u201cWe need a new UK Middle East strategy and set of policies that reflect the new reality in the region. We can no longer assume America will set the tone for the west\u2019s relationship with the Middle East and the UK must give serious thought to how our own approach will need to change. \u201cFrom inward investment to the UK, the impact of refugees from the region and our continuing reliance on gas and oil exports, our interests will continue to be intertwined with those of the region and the government must ensure it has the right plan for our relationship with it.\u201d Overall, the committee called for \u201ca new mindset in policy circles\u201d that questions the assumptions that have guided UK policy for the last century, including the power of external, rather than internal, actors to dominate the region. The findings will be seen as a warning to the foreign secretary, who has devoted considerable personal energy to the Middle East and set great store by his relationship with the Trump administration. The committee said the UK response to the Arab spring had been \u201cmuddled\u201d, sometimes supporting hereditary authoritarian family rulers, at other times siding with revolutionary movements fighting the old regimes. The government, the report said, had been over-reliant on Saudi assurances about how it is using UK arms in the war in Yemen , declaring this reliance \u201cis not an adequate way to implementing UK obligations under the arms trade treaty. The report called for the suspension of some arms sales if the Saudis were unable to be more transparent about their use of UK weaponry. It also urged a complete review by government of how it makes decisions on arms export licences. The report also suggested the UK more broadly must \u201cgo considerably further to improve transparency and accountability about its relationship with repressive regimes in the Gulf\u201d. \u201cOn key issues of public and parliamentary concern, the government has not been able to demonstrate that private diplomacy has been able to influence directions of policy,\u201d it added. Referring to an unpublished government strategy for the Gulf, the report said: \u201cThe UK has not taken the opportunity to set out a clear assessment of its objectives in the region to which it can be held to account.\u201d The committee was sharply critical of the role of the new US administration, saying it had the potential to destabilise the region further. On seeking a two-state solution in Palestine and on relations with Iran, the US president \u201chas taken positions that are unconstructive and could even escalate conflict\u201d, the committee found. The report said: \u201cThe mercurial and unpredictable nature of policymaking by President Trump has made it challenging for the UK government to influence US foreign policy so far, a challenge that is not likely to ease.\u201d Committee members condemned Johnson\u2019s decision to distance himself from French diplomatic efforts last year to reach a solution in the Middle East \u2013 with one describing it as childish. \u201cThe UK should support the initiative meaningfully this year both politically and financially,\u201d they said. The committee also said Johnson\u2019s position on whether President Assad could have a role in a future Syrian government was \u201cconfused\u201d, saying: \u201cHe set out a position that oscillated in the course of the one evidence session\u201d. \u201cThere are no good options in Syria,\u201d the report concluded, adding that \u201cthe removal of Assad as a prerequisite of any settlement is not going to be achievable with the current means and policy\u201d. In the case of Iran, the committee suggested the UK and Europe should ease banking regulations to open up new sources of finance for Tehran, even if Washington will not follow suit. It claimed Trump does not have the international support to tear up the existing Iran deal, but said \u201cthere is a dangerous escalatory logic to the US approach\u201d. The criticisms will sting the Foreign Office. Johnson has invested considerable energy in trying to influence US thinking, and claims the refusal to challenge Trump in public has led to changes in US thinking including towards Nato, Syria, Russia and even Iran. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \u201cThe Middle East remains a foreign policy priority and the UK will continue to work with international partners to achieve security and prosperity.\u201d", "author": "", "lang": "en"},

Since taking office, he has surprised many by staying away from the city that made him, while his wife, Melania, and young son Barron have remained in Trump Tower in Manhattan. But on Thursday, Trump will return to his home city for the first time since becoming president. He might not like what he finds. Despite having spent almost 70 years of his life in the Big Apple, stepping out on the town, cultivating and manipulating tabloid newspapers, and slapping his name on anything that didn\u2019t move, he is widely unpopular in New York City. Trump will be appearing with the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, aboard the USS Intrepid, an aircraft-carrier-turned-museum, in an event to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea \u2013 a naval battle waged by the US and Australia against Japan during the second world war. But blocks away, thousands of people will be staging a mass protest against the president and his government . \u201cWe want him to know, and we want the world to know, that Trump\u2019s values are not New York values,\u201d said Joe Dinkin, a director with the progressive Working Families party and one of the organizers of the demonstration. \u201cTrump has spent his first 100 days demonizing immigrants and Muslims and pushing a plan that would take healthcare away from millions of people,\u201d Dinkin said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want him to use a military setting, with New York City as a backdrop, as a kind of congratulatory press conference. We want the story to be about his real record.\u201d The president may well be expecting a hostile hometown reception. Trump\u2019s election sparked weeks of protests outside Trump Tower, where the president-elect was very publicly vetting people for his cabinet. The tower, with the president\u2019s name displayed in large gold lettering, had become a focal point for those fearful of what his reign would bring. The day after Trump\u2019s inauguration, more than 400,000 people marched up Fifth Avenue towards the president\u2019s home, while just this Saturday, hundreds of people held a \u201c100 days of failure\u201d rally outside the 58-story skyscraper. That Manhattan has been the center of the anti-Trump movement is likely to be particularly galling for a man who has made the borough one of the obsessions of his life. In The Art of the Deal , his insatiable desire to be a somebody in Manhattan is one of the few consistent themes. Trump grew up in a mansion in Queens but would sneak across the river on weekends. \u201cI believed, perhaps to an irrational degree, that Manhattan was always going to be the best place to live \u2013 the center of the world,\u201d Trump wrote. He was desperate to expand his father\u2019s huge but exclusively outer-borough real estate business into the hub of the city. \u201cI gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I\u2019ve gotta do it,\u201d Trump recalled telling his father, Fred Trump. He was also keen to engage in New York\u2019s high society \u2013 and in The Art of the Deal wrote about his numerous attempts to become a member of Le Club, a prestigious spot frequented by socialites, actors and sports stars. In the 1980s, he began planting stories about himself in New York tabloids \u2013 sometimes calling up reporters pretending to be his own publicist to brag about actors and celebrities who wanted to date him. He wanted to get his name out, to be famous, to make it in the city that never sleeps. During his primary campaign, Trump boasted about his popularity using a New York metaphor. \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose voters,\u201d Trump told a crowd in Iowa in January 2016. That may have been true in some parts of the country. But in December, just a month after his election, a Quinnipiac poll showed the president\u2019s favorability was just 23% in his home city, with nearly 70% of New Yorkers having an unfavorable view of him. The polling mirrored Trump\u2019s performance in the election, when he won just 18% of the vote in New York City, with 79% voting for Hillary Clinton. According to the New York City board of elections, there are 1,210 election districts in Manhattan. Donald Trump won one \u2013 Times Square , where a total of 14 people voted. Trump got seven votes, Hillary Clinton got six votes, and one person voted for the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson. Overall, Trump won 9.87% of the vote in Manhattan, compared with Clinton\u2019s 86.36%. The city he loved the most had shunned him. The daily protests at Trump Tower in the days following the election were not the only indicators of the president-elect\u2019s unpopularity. A week after Trump\u2019s victory, his name was removed from a series of buildings in Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side , after residents launched a petition against Trump\u2019s \u201cappalling treatment of women, his history of racism, his attacks on immigrants, his mockery of the disabled, his tax avoidance [and] his outright lying\u201d. Then, in January, there was an uproar after it emerged that protecting Trump and his family between election day and the inauguration had cost the New York police department $24m. Although the heavy police presence has probably lessened the chance of Trump\u2019s proposed shooting spree, the public\u2019s anger intensified further when Melania Trump announced she and the president\u2019s 11-year-old son, Barron, would stay in the city until the end of his school year. The youngest of Trump\u2019s children is enrolled at Columbia grammar and preparatory school in Manhattan, where alumni include the Nobel prize winner Murray Gell-Mann; Herman Melville, author of Moby-Dick; and Sarah Michelle Gellar from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The ill feeling toward Melania and Barron\u2019s extended stay has lingered \u2013 in no small part because it costs the NYPD between $127,000 and $146,000 a day to protect them and their home. The New York fire department expects the cost of protecting Trump\u2019s wife and son to be an additional $4.5m a year. About 550,000 people have signed a petition demanding that \u201cMelania Trump stay in the White House or pay for the expenses herself\u201d. When Trump himself visits the city, the NYPD says, it will cost $308,000 to keep him safe, and a visit to Trump Tower illustrates where the money is being spent. Metal barriers line two blocks of Fifth Avenue \u2013 one of Manhattan\u2019s most famous thoroughfares \u2013 outside Trump Tower. Large concrete blocks, branded with blue NYPD lettering, line the sidewalk, aimed at preventing cars from accessing the building. A coach-size NYPD \u201ccommand post\u201d vehicle is parked indiscreetly on a side street, while black Chevrolet Suburbans line the south side of the tower. At the entrance is a team of officers clad in black helmets and armed with high-powered rifles, while secret service agents scan visitors\u2019 bags. Inside, in the gold and marble lobby of Trump Tower, however, it\u2019s almost business as usual. The gift shop sells Donald Trump magnets, koozies, caps and onesies bearing the legend \u201cWhen I grow up I want to be just like Trump\u201d. But just as they are outside, police officers and security agents are everywhere \u2013 including in the bathrooms. Trump has seen flickers of support in New York. In March, there were two pro-Trump rallies in Manhattan . But neither was well attended, and both were overshadowed by anti-Trump demonstrations. Supporters held a third rally, outside Trump Tower, on Saturday, but were largely obscured by the \u201c100 days of failure\u201d crowd. Assunta Dell\u2019Elce, a Trump supporter from Long Island, was one of the organizers, but even she was downbeat. \u201cThey were, like, five times the size of our rally,\u201d Dell\u2019Elce said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a big crowd.\u201d Dell\u2019Elce and up to 100 Trump stalwarts are planning to show their support for the president again on Thursday, but will probably be outnumbered and drowned out by the naysayers. For a president who marked his 100th day in office with historically low approval ratings, the presence of this small band of supporters is unlikely to bring much joy. Trump\u2019s return to New York City looks almost certain to be an unhappy homecoming.", "author": "", "lang": "en"},

Street, 53, beat Labour\u2019s Si\u00f4n Simon, the former MP in Erdington, after he secured substantial majorities in Dudley and Solihull. Street won the incredibly close contest with 238,628 votes to Simon\u2019s 234,862. In his victory speech, Street said his campaign had reached every area of the region and hinted at a new direction for Conservative politics. He told the crowd at the Barclaycard Arena in central Birmingham: \u201cThis marks the rebirth of urban Conservatism. It\u2019s about economic success but about shaping a region which works for everybody no matter how strong or weak you are.\u201d He said his campaign could be a blueprint for future Conservative success. Simon admitted he was \u201cterribly disappointed\u201d by the defeat and suggested that Street had only won because of excessive funds spent on the Conservative campaign, which was reported to have cost about \u00a31m. Simon said: \u201cPersonally, a system whereby you can spend as much money as you like and don\u2019t have to account for it at all up until six weeks before election day does need to be looked at. \u201cThey admit to spending a million but who knows how much it really amounts to when you add it all up? We spent a small fraction of that and I said the turnout in Solihull, which is a Tory heartland and where the Tory millions have been poured into, was a third higher than the regional average and that accounts for the difference between the two parties.\u201d Simon, who remains a Labour MEP, said Labour voters had lost confidence in the party in its traditional heartlands. The former Erdington MP- whose campaign message was to \u201ctake back control\u201d of the West Midlands from London, said: \u201cI won\u2019t pretend that we didn\u2019t have coming back from the doorstep in areas that we did win, in our heartlands, a message from Labour voters that their confidence is waning in our strength of our traditional Labour values. \u201cWe should have been talking about transport, housing and taking back control of our region from London but we ended up talking about defence and immigration and Brexit and on those issues Labour voters in Labour areas were telling us, \u2018We don\u2019t feel confident that you\u2019re strong enough on Labour values\u2019.\u201d Labour stalwart, Khalid Mahmood, also claimed that Street had won the mayoral race due to \u201cthrowing money\u201d at the campaign. Mahmood, who has been MP in the Perry Barr constituency since 2005, said: \u201cThe reason he won is because of money, it is as simple as that. We spent less than 5% of what the conservatives threw at this and they were able to bombard households with slick literature as a result. It obviously makes a difference when you have so much more resource.\u201d Second preference votes were taken into account under the supplementary voting system after Street won the first round but neither candidate secured 50% . Street gave up his \u00a3800,000-a-year career to take part in the race to become the mayor of the West Midlands combined authority. He is expected to be paid around \u00a380,000 a year as mayor. The turnout was higher than expected at more than 26%, but it was the sixth worst turnout of the country\u2019s eight mayoral elections.

Addressing thousands of supporters in the grand courtyard of the Louvre, the vast Paris palace-turned-museum, Macron said he would defend France and Europe.

The anti-immigration, anti-EU Front National\u2019s supporters asserted that the party had a central place as an opposition force in France. Turnout was the lowest in more than 40 years. Almost one-third of voters chose neither Macron nor Le Pen, with 12 million abstaining and 4.2 million spoiling ballot papers. Macron, who has never held elected office and was unknown until three years ago, is France\u2019s youngest president. Next Sunday, he will take over a country under a state of emergency, still facing a major terrorism threat and struggling with a stagnant economy after decades of mass unemployment. France is divided after an election campaign in which anti-establishment anger saw the traditional left and right ruling parties ejected from the race in the first round for the first time since the period after the second world war. Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, an ex-minister and Macron\u2019s centrist ally, said: \u201cHe is the youngest head of state on the planet [which] sends an incredible message of hope. Macron is giving hope to people who had no hope. Hope that maybe we can do something, go beyond the [left-right] divide that no longer makes sense.\u201d Le Pen swiftly conceded defeat. She said she had won a \u201chistoric and massive\u201d score that made her leader of \u201cthe biggest opposition force\u201d in France and vowed to radically overhaul her Front National party . Her promise to \u201ctransform\u201d the far-right movement left open the possibility that the party could be expanded and renamed in an attempt to boost its electoral chances. It was a major step in the political normalisation of her movement. The outgoing Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who was once Macron\u2019s mentor and had appointed him economy minister, said: \u201cHis large victory confirms that a very great majority of our citizens wanted to unite around the values of the Republic and show their attachment to the European Union and show France is open to the world.\u201d On Monday Hollande embraced his successor as the two men attended a ceremony at Paris\u2019s Arc de Triomphe to commemorate victory over the Nazis in the second world war. Hollande walked beside Macron to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the monument, where they laid a wreath. Macron\u2019s victory came not only because voters supported his policy platform for free market, pro-business reform, and his promises to energise the EU, coupled with a leftwing approach to social issues. Some of his voters came from other parties across the political spectrum and turned out not in complete support of his programme but to stop the Front National. In a political landscape with a strong hard left and far right, Macron faces the challenge of trying to win a parliamentary majority for his fledgling political movement En Marche! (On the Move!) in legislative elections next month. Without a majority, he will not be able to carry out his manifesto promises. After the Brexit vote and the election of Trump as US president, the race for the \u00c9lys\u00e9e was the latest election to shake up establishment politics by kicking out the figures that stood for the status quo, ejecting the mainstream parties that have dominated French politics for 50 years and leaving the political novice Macron to do battle with the far right. His victory comes after a bitter campaign with Le Pen in which she accused him of being part of an elite that did not understand ordinary people and he said Le Pen represented the \u201cparty of hatred\u201d that wanted a \u201ccivil war\u201d in France. The runoff pitted France\u2019s most Europhile candidate against its most Europhobe. In Brussels and Berlin, there was relief that Le Pen\u2019s anti-EU, anti-globalisation programme was defeated. A spokesman for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said it was a \u201cvictory for a strong and united Europe\u201d while the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said French voters had chosen a \u201cEuropean future\u201d. The office of the British prime minister, Theresa May, said she \u201cwarmly congratulates\u201d Macron on his victory and \u201cwe look forward to working with the new president on a wide range of shared priorities\u201d. Trump, who will meet Macron on 25 May at the Nato summit in Brussels, tweeted: \u201cCongratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next president of France. I look very much forward to working with him!\u201d Earlier in the campaign, he had declared Le Pen the strongest candidate. In a congratulatory statement, the Kremlin, which was widely seen as backing Le Pen, urged Macron to overcome mutual distrust and join forces to ensure international stability and security. Hours before the end of campaigning on Friday night, Macron\u2019s campaign was hacked, which Paris prosecutors are investigating. Hundreds of thousands of emails and documents were dumped online and spread by WikiLeaks in what his campaign called an attempt at \u201cdemocratic destabilisation\u201d. Macron, a former investment banker and senior civil servant who grew up in a bourgeois family in Amiens, served as deputy chief of staff to Hollande but was not part of the Socialist party. In 2014, Hollande appointed him economy minister but he left government in 2016, complaining that pro-business reforms were not going far enough. A year ago he formed En Marche!, promising to shake up France\u2019s \u201cvacuous\u201d and discredited political class. Macron campaigned on pledges to ease labour laws, improve education in deprived areas and extend protections for self-employed people. The election race was full of extraordinary twists and turns . Hollande became the first president since the war to decide not to run again for office after slumping to record unpopularity with a satisfaction rating of 4%. His troubled five-year term left France still struggling with a sluggish economy and a mood of disillusionment with the political class. The country is more divided than ever before. More than 230 people have been killed in terrorist attacks in little more than two years, the political class is questioning Islam\u2019s place in French society and more than three million people are unemployed. The rightwing candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, once seen as favourite, was badly damaged by a judicial investigation into a string of corruption allegations, including that he paid his wife and children generous salaries from public funds for fake parliamentary assistant jobs. The ruling Socialist party, under its candidate Beno\u00eet Hamon, saw its score plunge to 6%, while the hard-left Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon finished fourth. The final round marks a redrawing of the political landscape, away from the old left-right divide towards a contest between a liberal, pro-globalisation stance and \u201cclose the borders\u201d nationalism. Le Pen has styled the election as being between her party\u2019s \u201cpatriots\u201d and the \u201cglobalists\u201d whom she says Macron represents. ", "author": "", "lang": "en"},

Titled The President Is Missing, the novel is being billed as a \u201cunique amalgam of intrigue, suspense and behind-the-scenes global drama from the highest corridors of power\u201d. Though publisher and writer were keeping tight-lipped about the advance paid for the novel, it is thought to have gone for a significant seven-figure sum. In 2004, Clinton was rumoured to have been paid a then record-breaking $16m (\u00a312m) advance for his memoirs. The novel, which will appear in June 2018, will draw on details that \u201conly a president can know\u201d, said publisher Penguin Random House . In a statement released through his publisher, Clinton, who left office in 2001, said: \u201cWorking on a book about a sitting president \u2013 drawing on what I know about the job, life in the White House, and the way Washington works \u2013 has been a lot of fun.\u201d He described working with Patterson, who is as famous for collaborating on books as he is for individual bestsellers, as \u201cterrific\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of his for a very long time.\u201d Patterson said that the collaboration had given him access to firsthand experience of the Oval Office, which had \u201cuniquely informed\u201d the book. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller, and President Clinton\u2019s insight has allowed us to tell a really interesting one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare combination \u2013 readers will be drawn to the suspense, of course, but they\u2019ll also be given an inside look into what it\u2019s really like to be president.\u201d Clinton, a keen reader of thrillers and mysteries, has known Patterson for 10 years, during which time they have become golf partners. They came up with the idea for the novel after the lawyer they both retain suggested they work together. They started working on the book in late 2016, and though details of the plot are being held back until publication, a source told the Guardian it would involve a sitting US president being kidnapped. In an unusual move, the book is being jointly published in the US by Clinton\u2019s publisher Knopf and Patterson\u2019s US publisher Little, Brown. In the UK, both men are published by Penguin Random House, which will release the novel under its Century imprint. Patterson has built a reputation as a fiction factory thanks to his extensive collaborations on books, which have also made him one of the most prolific authors in the world. This will be Clinton\u2019s first venture into fiction, but expectations are high after his 2004 memoir My Life became a global bestseller, selling in excess of 2m copies in the US alone. Announcing the deal in the UK, Susan Sandon, PRH divisional managing director, said: \u201cThis unprecedented collaboration, with its compelling mix of insider knowledge and edge-of-the-seat suspense, is utterly irresistible.\u201d The book\u2019s joint US publishers Sonny Mehta and Michael Pietsch added: \u201cThe pages we\u2019ve read to date are riveting, full of intricate plotting and detail. This is a book that promises to entertain and delight millions of readers around the world, and we are thrilled to be working on it together.\u201d", "author": "", "lang": "en"},

The sun is reaching through the trees, and plumes of mist rise from the river\u2019s surface as it warms. The golden reed along the river\u2019s edge vibrates with the pulsing, chattering songs of reed warblers and sedge warblers \u2013 the sound of a wetland summer. They began to return to Waltham Brooks about a month ago, and now I count more than 30 singing around the reserve. I hear a whirring from a sedge warbler in the brambles next to me, and I turn to watch as it inches up to the top of the bush. The small, brown bird \u2013 with dark streaks on its head and back, and a broad buff stripe above each eye \u2013 shrieks and whistles its hurried song, as if it is trying to squeeze as many different notes into as short a time as possible. The skulking reed warblers, with their more rhythmic, unhurried \u201cchett, chett, chett\u201d song, remain hidden lower down. I walk slowly around the Brooks, listening to the songs and calls of the birds. There\u2019s the profane, explosive outburst of a Cetti\u2019s warbler , the short \u201cseep-seep-sing\u201d of a reed bunting , and the pure trills and crescendos of a distant nightingale . There are four lesser whitethroats \u2013 two competing with each other from neighbouring willows. Their song consists of a short stuttering chatter that ends with a long, tuneful rattle of notes almost as pure as a nightingale\u2019s trill. I\u2019ve encountered lots of lesser whitethroats across different habitats in West Sussex this spring, hearing many more of them in the past two weeks than the more usual, larger common whitethroats. Perhaps the prevailing winds have meant a particularly high concentration in this area. Three swifts fly past me. The black scythes sweep fast and low, banking to feed on the first insects of the day to emerge from the water. These are the first swifts I\u2019ve seen this year, and I feel my pulse quicken and my heart lift to see them back again.

Then the blessing. The Supreme Leader cast her eyes around the congregation gathered in the Millennium suite of the Richard Herrod Centre on the outskirts of Nottingham. Every May Team candidate from the Midlands \u2013 even the apostates Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry \u2013 were gazing back at her in awe. \u201cTouch us,\u201d they murmured. \u201cHeal us. Make us whole. Give us the strength and stability to be strong and stable, so that we can spread thy Word of Truth.\u201d Once she was sure she had absolute silence, the Supreme Leader began to impart her message. Personally she was getting a little tired of saying \u201cstrong and stable\u201d over and over again , but as Supreme Leader she had to be mindful of her responsibilities. She knew that her high priests and priestesses had come to hear her say the holy words and it would be wrong to disappoint. \u201cWhat this country needs is strong and stable leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd only one person can deliver that strong and stable leadership.\u201d Morgan nodded her head vigorously, willing herself into a state of hysteria. There are none so openly devout as the forcibly converted. No one escapes the Inquisition. \u201cCan you picture Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street?\u201d Kim Jong-May enquired. A few of her disciples sniggered. The Supreme Leader was not best pleased. It was important to be seen to take the possibility seriously. Relax for a second and her whole edifice might begin to crumble. People might then see they had a choice between the barely credible and the barely competent. After a few more strong and stables and a final exhortation to do door-to-door searches for Team May refuseniks, the Supreme Leader took questions from the press about the decision by the CPS not to prosecute any Tory MPs over their 2015 election spending . She hailed it as a great day for the country. From now on 10 May would always be celebrated as the day when the Tories had been cleared of doing anything wrong even though the Electoral Commission had fined them \u00a370,000 for doing something wrong. An hour or so later, the Supreme Leader went to walk among the workers of a printing and design centre in Mansfield. She had said she would spread the gospel to the little people and she was a woman who liked to keep her word. A vote for her was a vote for a strong and stable leader of a strong and stable government. Only with a strong and stable government could the country have the strong and stable economy that would deliver strong and stable jobs. She didn\u2019t bother to mention any policies as she didn\u2019t really have any apart from one on energy price caps that she had nicked from Ed Miliband and most people thought was a bit crap. On and on she went, deeper and deeper into her inner mediocrity and inadequacy, repeating herself both by accident and design, such that she didn\u2019t appear to notice that she had lost the attention of almost everyone on the factory floor. Even her special advisers were rolling their eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s have some questions,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause you are the people who really matter.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean it, but she felt obliged to say so. Much to the Supreme Leader\u2019s surprise, no one was very interested in how strong and stable she was and instead had rather more real and pressing concerns. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing any TV debates?\u201d asked a woman. That was easy. \u201cBecause I am much too busy going out into the work place and other environments to talk to people,\u201d the Supreme Leader replied. She didn\u2019t specify what these other environments might be, but she would definitely be going there. To Brexit and beyond. Others had questions about homelessness and food banks. The Supreme Leader struggled with these. Homelessness would be solved by making fewer people homeless and she would halve the queues at food banks by stopping greedy nurses from stuffing their faces there. What did she mean by people aspiring to a better life and what levels should they aspire to? This was the Supreme Leader\u2019s existential moment. Her raison d\u2019etre. To everything there was a season. For some people it might be striving to be the best printer or the best taxi driver. For her it was about being the Most Supreme Leader the world had yet known. And that time would soon come.", "author": "", "lang": "en"},

Leaning even as it landed, its beak led it in a pitter-patter metre-dash for the pond. At the water\u2019s edge its head dipped then jerked back, and it tossed something very large over its shoulder on to the turf. In this droughty, wormless spring, our resident male blackbird had switched to becoming a fisher of newts . This was the seventh I had seen him catch in just a few days. The beached newt landed sunny side up and the sleek blackbird skipped over. The bird stood over the yellow-bellied, thrashing animal, shuffling his feet, as if readying himself to split a log. He stabbed three times, then hopped around to strike again. The newt writhed, wriggled, twitched, then lay unmoving. Still the blackbird continued his assault, twice spearing the lifeless body and hurling it about, as a dog might play with a soft toy. He pulled the newt over to the patio and pulverised the carcass a little more. Then he worked his beak like a pair of tweezers round the newt\u2019s middle and carried it off over the fence, the two halves dangling limply from either side of his mouth. The next day, I saw the exercise repeated, except this time the blackbird\u2019s begging baby was squatting right in front of the kitchen window. The adult gathered up the newt, whose underside was bloodied and discoloured. He threw the body in the direction of the fledgling\u2019s protesting gape, but it bounced off and fell to the ground. The parent bird made six more ineffectual attempts before he folded the newt like a sandwich and crammed it down the youngster\u2019s throat. Later that evening the blackbird returned to the pond, teetering on the rim, cocking his head on one side and giving the water a hard stare. He was there again today, fishing with his eyes, padding around the pond\u2019s edge. His nervous excitement and attention seemed to drain away with each fruitless search for yet more prey.

It is an early flowerer and will grow abundantly on steep cliffs, sometimes forming sizeable, rather untidy clumps of stemmed white flowers. There is something endearing about this unassuming yet resilient plant, whose presence here is so linked to the beginning of a fresh new season. Strangely, its scent is not mentioned in most of the plant identification guides, yet springtime walks with a warm breeze lifting and carrying up with it the sweet fragrance of the profusion of flowers unseen on the rocky faces below have always been a delight. Here on the accessible west coast of the island, there are no steep cliffs, only endless white beaches backed by dunes or short nibbled turf. But even here on the turf, scurvy-grass is to be found, albeit in much smaller patches, huddling low and almost stemless to the ground. Despite the second part of its name, it is not a grass at all but a member of the cabbage family; and its small white flowers bear the arrangement of four petals from which the descriptive Latin name of this group, Cruciferae , arises. However, the \u201cscurvy\u201d part tells us much more. Scurvy is a disease related to vitamin C deficiency, and in times past, the leaves, bitter though they are, were eaten to provide a welcome dose of vitamin C after a winter diet lacking in fresh greens. The leaves could also be prepared as an infusion, and even brewed as an ale, a possibly more enjoyable way of providing a much needed spring tonic. Down at the end of a track across an expanse of machair vibrant with the sound of skylarks and lapwing is a little low headland. But though it is often battered by winter storms, the hardy scurvy-grass still manages to grow here. By kneeling and pressing one\u2019s nose to even these dwarfed plants, it is possible to catch a faint trace of their evocative scent.

Even on one of his livelier days, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon , gives the impression of a sub-optimal, secondhand android, but for his performance on the Andrew Marr Show he was reduced to a state of near-catatonia. Marr began by challenging Fallon on the Conservative party\u2019s failure to honour its commitments to maintain the size of Britain\u2019s armed services. \u201cThe computer says no,\u201d said Mogadon Mike. The fact that he hadn\u2019t managed to meet his recruitment targets and numbers were falling were a sure sign his policy was working. What was happening was a tactical retreat to make the enemy think we didn\u2019t have a big military capability. And once we had lured them into a false sense of security we would conduct a massive recruitment drive and take over the planet. Not entirely convinced by Mogadon Mike\u2019s cunning plan, Marr moved on to how the Tories were going to fund their promise to increase defence spending by \u00a31bn more than the 2% annual target. \u201cBy growing the economy,\u201d said Mogadon Mike, who didn\u2019t appear to have read the government\u2019s own briefing papers that even the most optimistic Brexit forecasts suggest the economy is likely to take a five-year hit. \u201cThere\u2019s a black hole in the defence equipment budget of \u00a37bn,\u201d said Marr. There was also a black hole in the TV studio into which Mogadon Mike\u2019s personality had long since disappeared. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make \u00a37.3bn of efficiency savings by selling off some airfields,\u201d the defence secretary replied defensively. It was like this. Now that we only had about eight serviceable aircraft in the RAF we really didn\u2019t need the luxury of giving each plane two of its own airfields. So the plan was to flog all the airfields to the Candy brothers so they could build luxury gated communities for Russian oligarchs and Saudi princes in the middle of nowhere. And as for the remaining eight RAF planes, their takeoffs and landings could be neatly scheduled into the runway expansion at Heathrow airport. Marr then asked about whether Britain\u2019s nuclear subs might be vulnerable to the same cyber threat as the NHS . He might also have wondered if Jeremy Hunt had been recently appointed a submarine commander for all the media time the health secretary has taken up explaining the disaster. Mogadon Mike didn\u2019t want to go into operational details but he could put people\u2019s minds at rest. While the NHS was using Windows XP, the Vanguard subs were still on Windows 95 and so weren\u2019t at risk. \u201cIs there any wars you haven\u2019t supported?\u201d Marr asked. Mogadon Mike looked puzzled. Why would anyone pass up the opportunity to have a good war? Or a bad one. The intervention in Libya had been absolutely necessary, he insisted, because it was absolutely vital to prevent a humanitarian disaster by creating an even bigger one. The people of Britain couldn\u2019t keep funding the armed services if they never got to see them use their weapons. Sensing that Mogadon Mike was in clear and present danger of flatlining on the sofa, Marr brought along Labour\u2019s shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry , to apply some defibrillation. \u201cCan you remember where you were on 27 May 2007?\u201d Emily asked, after Fallon had brought up Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s associations with the IRA. Mogadon Mike can barely remember what he has done five minutes previously \u2013 a bonus for interviews like the one he had just given \u2013 but he was sure Emily would enlighten him. She would. He had been at a celebration party in Syria to commiserate with President Assad over only getting 99% of the vote and to wish him all the best with the genocide of his own country. \u201cI don\u2019t recall this,\u201d Mogadon Mike said angrily, finally showing a flicker of a pulse and choosing to launch a counterstrike. Hadn\u2019t she just just said Corbyn would hand over the Falklands to the Argies? \u201cThat\u2019s bollocks.\u201d Emily replied. Marr tried not to snigger. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. You can\u2019t make stuff up as you go along.\u201d Mogadon Mike didn\u2019t see why not, as his malware started spewing out garbled data about Corbyn\u2019s journey. He somehow managed to overlook the supreme leader \u2019s journey, which had been far more arduous than Jeremy\u2019s. From remainer to hard Brexiteer, from no election to election: all within a year. In the Battle for Britain, this had been Emily\u2019s finest hour.", "author": "", "lang": "en"},

Stable binoculars reveal its four main moons while telescopes show its disc, 42 arcsec wide and crossed by bands of cloud aligned parallel to its equator. Whorls, streaks and spots, including the Great Red Spot, are also seen, all carried across the disc as the planet rotates in a little under 10 hours. Jupiter is currently tracking westwards in Virgo, 11\u00b0 NW (above-right) of the star Spica. That motion reverses on 10 June following a stationary point 3\u00b0 SE of the celebrated double star Porrima whose two equal stars of mag 3.5 currently lie less than 3 arcsec apart as they orbit each other every 169 years. A much easier naked-eye double star lies almost directly overhead as Jupiter crosses the meridian and is identified on our chart which look northwards from Virgo to the zenith and beyond as the night begins at present. Mizar shines at mag 2.2 in the handle of the Plough, perhaps better known as the Big Dipper by US starwatchers, and has a mag 4.0 companion, Alcor, which is 12 arcmin (about a third of a Moon-width) away. Together they are dubbed the Horse and Rider, but whether they are tied together by gravity is open to question. A curving line along the Plough\u2019s handle extends to the red giant Arcturus in Bootes , the fourth-brightest star in the night sky, the second brightest ever seen from Britain (after Sirius) and the brightest in the sky\u2019s N hemisphere. There is a mnemonic that goes \u201c arc to Arcturus, spike to Spica \u201d since our curving line may be stretched further to reach Spica. I suggest that this year we could recast this to read \u201carc to Arcturus, jump to Jupiter\u201d, although the planet can hardly be mistaken. The region of sky to the N of Jupiter has been called the Realm of the Galaxies . Halfway between the stars Vindemiatrix in Virgo and Denebola in Leo, and at a distance of some 54m light years, lies the heart of the Virgo cluster of galaxies. Its brightest galaxies were spotted late in the 18th century and found their way into Messier\u2019s iconic catalogue of fuzzy celestial objects. Now we suspect that it holds in excess of 1,300 galaxies, all telescopic objects. On a still larger scale, the Virgo cluster is just one element of the Virgo supercluster of galaxies which spills over the entire area of our chart and even includes the Local Group cluster of galaxies to which our Milky Way belongs. Another supercluster, centred in the constellation of Coma Berenices (COMA on our chart), lies some 15\u00b0 further N and almost twice as far away. The only one of the 88 constellations to be named after a real person, Queen Berenice II of Egypt , Coma contains no bright stars but is distinguished by an inverted V of dim stars \u2013 actually a real star cluster called Melotte 111 at a distance of 280 light years.

Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions (RAL), which bought BHS for \u00a31 in 2015, has been accused of extracting an estimated \u00a317m from the retailer despite owning it for just 13 months before it went into administration in 2016. RAL was put into liquidation earlier this month after a high court ruling on the group\u2019s financial state, details of which were published on Tuesday. The ruling paves the way for liquidators to sift through RAL\u2019s paperwork seeking clarity on where funds taken from BHS were moved to and attempting to recover them. As the main director of RAL, Chappell could be personally liable for money owed by the company. Lance Ashworth QC, a barrister specialising in insolvency, said liquidators would now be closely examining RAL\u2019s accounts to establish if all the payments and agreements made by the company were legitimate. \u201cIf a payment has been made to somebody it shouldn\u2019t have been paid out to in breach of the directors\u2019 fiduciary duty, then the directors will be liable to make a contribution to the company\u2019s assets,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cThey will also seek to establish if the company had been trading while insolvent. That could lead to a charge of wrongful trading. The liquidators will look at the company\u2019s financial position at the outset and at the end of the day and could ask for a contribution for the difference between them.\u201d The registrar who judged the case dismissed Chappell\u2019s claim that RAL had about \u00a310m of assets and so was still a viable business. Chappell claimed that Green owed RAL at least \u00a35.5m related to the sale of BHS\u2019s headquarters Marylebone House. However, the registrar ascribed a nominal value of just \u00a31 to RAL for this asset. Chappell presented documents suggesting he was planning legal action to recoup up to \u00a38.5m from Green on the basis of a handwritten note dating from March 2015 when the retail tycoon sold BHS to RAL for \u00a31. However, the registrar found that a \u00a33.5m loan to RAL from Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, which includes Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, remained valid. Payment of that debt will depend on the amount of assets liquidators can recoup from RAL to pay back all the group\u2019s creditors. The ruling also confirms that BHS made a loan of \u00a36.2m to RAL on the day before it sent out proposals for an insolvency agreement known as a \u201ccompany voluntary arrangement\u201d in which it asked landlords to accept lower rents. The judgment also refers to a \u00a32.8m payment from BHS to RAL which went straight to its directors including Chappell. The documents outline how RAL then charged BHS quarterly management fees, which exactly matched the amounts owed in repayments on the \u00a36.2m loan from the retailer to its owner. Once BHS went into administration and these management fee payments dried up, RAL was unable to meet its loan repayments and the balance of the loan, \u00a35.98m, then fell due. The documents also reveal that Chappell tried to turn a \u00a31.5m loan from RAL secured against his parents\u2019 home into an asset. Chappell said the loan had been swapped for a 43% stake in a Portuguese development company called Chaplake held by his father. Chappell said this asset was worth \u00a35.08m. The judge said Chappell had provided no evidence to support that claim and the asset was more likely to be worth \u00a31.5m. Chappell had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. ", "author": "", "lang": "en"},

Increases in the cost of clothing, car tax and air fares were also blamed by the Office for National Statistics for the rise in consumer price inflation (CPI) that exceeded City forecasts of 2.6%, and soared above the previous month\u2019s figure of 2.3% . With wages increasing by just 1.9%, opposition parties and the TUC said the new inflation figure highlighted the growing pressure on living standards and consumer spending. The economy has grown over the last two years in response to a surge in consumer spending, fuelled largely by an increase in credit . But the fall in the value of sterling following the Brexit vote has pushed up the prices of imports, especially of food and clothing. The Bank of England predicted last week that inflation would peak at 2.7% in the summer. However, this forecast looks like it will need to be revised, especially after the ONS said producer output price inflation was above 3%, indicating that further rises in inflation could be expected. Liberal Democrat shadow business secretary Susan Kramer said : \u201cThese worrying levels of inflation show the Brexit squeeze is hitting shopping baskets across the country.\u201d The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said the government needed to protect workers from a slump in real wages . \u201cWorking people are still \u00a320 a week worse off, on average, than they were before the crash. That\u2019s why living standards must be a key battleground at this election,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the parties need to explain how they\u2019ll create better-paid jobs, especially in the parts of the UK that need them most.\u201d City economists were divided over the path of inflation over the next year, with some expecting a modest and brief rise above 3% while others said it would be more sustained. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, said he expected further electricity and gas price rises and that an acceleration in food price rises would push CPI inflation to 3.25% in the autumn. \u201cWe remain convinced that the market is underestimating the further upside for inflation from here,\u201d he said. Clarke argued that the retail prices index (RPI), which includes some housing costs, was already at 3.5% and would rise to 4.25% before the end of the year, putting extreme pressure on consumers to cut back spending on non-essential items. The National Institute for Economic & Social Research (NIESR) forecast last week that British workers will see their disposable incomes shrinking this year as a result of rising inflation that will peak at 3.4%, while average wage rises are capped at only 2.7%. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said rising inflation would put a further squeeze on real incomes and force Threadneedle Street to delay any move to raise interest rates. \u201cThe Bank of England will most likely sit tight on interest rates through 2017 and 2018 \u2013 and very possibly well beyond. \u201cWe suspect it will end up remaining tolerant on the inflation overshoot given likely limited UK growth and the prolonged, highly uncertain outlook that the UK economy will face as the government negotiates the exit from the EU,\u201d he said. But Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics , was more optimistic that inflation would be held in check. He said many of the elements pushing up inflation were one-off factors and their effect would wane over the coming months. \u201cThe sharp rise was mainly due to factors that, while they won\u2019t be reversed, shouldn\u2019t be repeated. Indeed, a large part of the rise in inflation reflected air fares reversing the previous month\u2019s fall as a result of Easter shifting from March last year to April this year. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, vehicle excise duty rates rose this April and tobacco and alcohol duty increased by more this year than they did last year,\u201d he said.", "author": "", "lang": "en"},

Step from rough ground over the cattle grids that mark the national park perimeter and the verges become thick with vegetation. In warm weather the roadside flowers are busy with flying insects, and I take lazy pleasure in knowing such diversity is beyond my naming abilities. Walking a familiar route along the moorland fringe I came across a bizarre-looking beetle lumbering from beneath the undergrowth on to the dusty lane ahead. Glossy black and roughly the length of a biro top, its front end was ant-like, with a rounded head and twitching antennae, while its vastly enlarged rear extended well beyond the wing cases. It resembled a tiny aubergine on legs. This is Meloe violaceus , the violet oil beetle , so called for the viscous toxic liquid it secretes to deter predators, and its carapace, which can have an attractive purple or blue sheen in sunlight. The life cycle of this threatened invertebrate \u2013 one of five oil beetle species in Britain \u2013 is as extraordinary as its appearance. The female I found, dragging her distended abdomen along the ground, would lay thousands of eggs in short burrows in bare soil. The larvae that hatch climb up flower stems and wait among the petals for flying pollinators to arrive. They grab on to solitary mining bees with hooked feet and hitch a ride back to their nests, where they gorge on the host\u2019s stores until ready to pupate and eventually emerge as adults. The loss of wildflower meadows, and the bees that depend on them, has caused a decline in oil beetles, with three species now extinct in the UK. The beetle in front of me was making steady progress, jointed legs paddling the ground as it hefted its giant abdomen onward. Despite container-lorry proportions, its purposeful demeanour gave it an endearing quality. I guided it back from the road into the safety of the verge and watched this idiosyncratic arthropod clamber off through the foliage, a lone traveller well over the baggage limit, dragging its luggage behind it.

The Resolution Foundation said that the downgrade to Britain\u2019s future productivity performance expected in next week\u2019s budget would have a negative impact on wage growth between now and 2022 and also limit the room for manoeuvre of the chancellor, Philip Hammond. In its pre-budget report, the thinktank said it believed the independent Office for Budget Responsibility would cut its long-term estimate of productivity growth to 1% \u2013 half its level before the financial crisis broke in 2007. The OBR has already signalled that it has given up on the notion that productivity will rebound to its pre-crisis levels and the Resolution Foundation said this would have an impact both on wages and on the state of the public finances. The thinktank said wages were on course to be \u00a324.50 a week lower in inflation-adjusted terms in 2022 than anticipated at the time of the March 2017 budget. This would leave them \u00a322.70 or just over 4% below their level in 2007 and delay the return to their pre-crisis peak into later in the 2020s. According to the foundation, the last time Britain suffered a decade of productivity growth as weak as that since 2007 was in the 10-year period which started in 1812 \u2013 the year of Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Russia. Wage growth over the past 10 years has been the worst since the period starting in 1825. Matt Whittaker, the foundation\u2019s chief economist, said weaker productivity would mean the economy \u2013 as measured by gross domestic product \u2013 being \u00a344bn smaller in 2022 than envisaged in the March budget. He added that GDP per person would be \u00a3650 lower in 2022 than the OBR was forecasting eight months ago due to the productivity downgrade. Whittaker said:\u201cBudget day looks set to bring bad news about what we have the potential to produce as a country. It looks likely that we are currently living through the worst decade for productivity growth since the start of the 19th century. \u201cThe focus so far has been on what these terrible forecasts are likely to mean for the public finances, despite the recent better-than-expected performance on borrowing. That is understandable given that the chancellor is likely to be much closer to breaking his fiscal rules, with additional pressure from higher interest rates and reversals on planned tax rises and welfare cuts. However, the chancellor does not look set to be in a materially worse position than chancellors have been used to since 2010. \u201cWhile anxiety on the public finances may have been overdone, there has been nowhere near enough focus on family finances. Weekly pay is projected to be almost \u00a325 lower in 2022 than previously expected, still \u00a322.70 below the pre-crisis peak. Addressing this unprecedented living standards squeeze \u2013 with action on housing and social security \u2013 should be front and centre of the chancellor\u2019s response.\u201d At the launch of the Resolution Foundation report, Rachel Reeves, chair of the Commons business committee, said only in London and the south-east had wages made up the ground lost during the financial crisis. \u201cWe need more well-paid jobs in the north of England,\u201d she said. Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, said the budget should be used to reform universal credit, which he described as a \u201crecruiter for destitution\u201d by depriving claimants of income for \u201chuge periods of time\u201d. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, said Hammond might need to consider delaying cuts in corporation tax as a result of the pressure on the public finances. \u201cWhat I would like to see is a real vision of a post-Brexit Britain,\u201d Morgan added. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk , or sign up to the daily Business Today email here .", "author": "", "lang": "en"},

The Scottish National party leader said that although the Conservatives did well \u201cby their standards\u201d, they did so by taking votes from Labour, not by eating into SNP support. The Tories\u2019 share of the vote in Scotland was no better than Labour\u2019s in England, which was regarded as a \u201cdisaster\u201d for Jeremy Corbyn, the first minister said. The general election for Scottish voters would be a straight choice between the Conservatives, who are likely to win power at Westminster on the back of their support in England, and the SNP, who would \u201cstand up for Scotland\u2019s interests,\u201d she said. Meeting victorious SNP candidates in Glasgow, where Labour lost overall control of the council for the first time since 1980, Sturgeon told Sky News on Saturday: \u201cYes, by their standards, the Tories did well \u2013 and I take nothing away from them \u2013 but they did well entirely at the expense of the Labour party. \u201cAs we go into the general election, the people of Scotland have a clear choice. It is pretty clear that Theresa May, on the strength of support in England, is going to win the general election. So for people in Scotland, if they want strong voices standing up for Scotland\u2019s interests and holding the Tories to account in Westminster, that can only come from the SNP.\u201d Thursday\u2019s council elections saw the Conservatives gain 164 seats in Scotland to achieve a tally of 276. Labour shed 112 councillors to trail in third on 262, losing control of three councils. But both were outstripped by the SNP , which added 31 councillors to win a total of 431 seats. Nationally, May\u2019s party gained more than 550 council seats and swept to shock victories in mayoralty contests in the West Midlands and Tees Valley. The results put the Tories on track to secure a significant majority in the general election. The prime minister insisted she was not taking \u201canything for granted\u201d but her party enjoyed a stunning day that was matched by a dramatic decline for Labour, which lost more than 300 seats. The results saw Labour lose control of a series of English councils, including Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Northumberland, as well as losing its grip on Glasgow. Paul Nuttall\u2019s Ukip was crushed as every single councillor facing re-election suffered defeat. It is understood John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, will be at the centre of Labour\u2019s pitch to voters in the next four weeks as the party tries to bounce back for the general election. Corbyn acknowledged there had been some \u201cdifficult\u201d results but quickly switched to Labour\u2019s core campaign message on Friday evening. \u201cWe will not be a government that presides over food bank Britain or asks teachers to go on the school gates and collect funds to pay the teachers\u2019 wages,\u201d he said. Sturgeon said on Saturday: \u201cIf you compare north and south of the border, the Tories polled less in Scotland than Jeremy Corbyn did in England, and yet Jeremy Corbyn has been written off as a disaster.\u201d The election results showed the SNP in the ascendency, with the Tories and Labour \u201cscrapping for second place\u201d, she said. \u201cThe day after my party has won by a considerable margin more votes, more seats and more councils than any other party and improved our position on the last council election, I think I\u2019m reasonably entitled to feel quite optimistic as we go into the next contest.\u201d Sturgeon rejected the suggestion that the SNP\u2019s share of votes indicated it would struggle to achieve a majority in a future independence referendum, insisting the two contests were not comparable. \u201cThe Tories put an independence referendum at the heart of their campaign. It was the only thing they spoke about,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet they lost the election yesterday. It was the Tories who tried to make it a referendum on an independence referendum and they came quite a distant second. If there\u2019s a message at all on that issue, it\u2019s a message for the Conservatives.\u201d Meanwhile, Nuttall said his party was \u201ccaught in a Tory tidal wave\u201d after losing all its 145 councillors in the local elections. Ukip\u2019s sole win was a gain from Labour in Lancashire, as its vote share collapsed nationally from from 22% to less than 5%. On a campaign stop in Skegness on Saturday, Nuttall claimed the results were not a disaster. \u201cIt was expected. We dust ourselves down and go on,\u201d he said. \u201cUkip does have a great future. It just has to stay on the pitch, hold its ground and people will come back to us. \u201cIt is very easy for [Theresa May] to talk the talk and act tough, but when she\u2019s asked to walk the walk, I think there\u2019s going to be problems,\u201d he told the BBC. Nuttall said he expected a revival of the Eurosceptic party\u2019s fortunes when the hard realities of the Brexit negotiations become clear and May was forced to make concessions over the terms of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. \u201cShe will buckle,\u201d Nuttall said. \u201cShe will start to barter things away. Fisheries will go, there will be movement on immigration, on freedom of movement \u2013 she will buckle on that. When people are angry and feel they did not get the Brexit they voted for, they will come back to us. Ukip could be bigger than it ever was before.\u201d", "author": "", "lang": "en"},

You can picture the scene: a red-faced student stands mortified in front of her fellow classmates, struggling to recite a poem she had barely an hour to learn. Except, they do things differently in Stoke. \u201cIt\u2019s fun because I use my hands,\u201d beams Mohammed Abouebaida, a year\u00a07 student at Thistley Hough academy, as he squishes and moulds a wet lump of clay. All round him, Mohammed\u2019s classmates make clay soldiers or create army tanks and barbed wire fences \u2013 symbols of the first world war poems they will later recite. The idea, explains their teacher, Alison Ward, is that children learn better when they\u2019re active: \u201cThey really enjoy it and engage. If you say they\u2019ve got to memorise a poem, that sounds dry. This gets them to use other techniques to\u00a0help them, aside from rote learning.\u201d In schools across Stoke, clay is being brought back into the classroom in an attempt to keep alive the city\u2019s proud pottery legacy \u2013 and keep creativity on the curriculum. Nearly 1,000 children in 15 schools across the Potteries have been introduced to clay for the first time this year under the British Ceramics Biennial\u2019s clay schools programme. It wants every child in Stoke to have used clay in the classroom by 2021, when the city hopes to be the UK City of Culture. It\u2019s more than a misty-eyed nod to the city\u2019s past. In the schools that have tested the programme, teachers report positive results for otherwise challenging students, particularly boys. \u201cThey really engage with the making and creativity and the ability to express themselves visually through clay,\u201d says Julia Rogers, director of design at Thistley Hough, a large secondary on the edge of Stoke city centre. Thistley Hough has children recently arrived from Afghanistan and Iraq, Cuba and the Philippines. Some 37 languages are spoken in the playground and for 309 of its 719 pupils, English is not their mother tongue. This means clay is a particularly valuable way of teaching, says Rogers: \u201cIt\u2019s a visual language so the literacy barrier isn\u2019t there. They\u2019ve come into a new country where the experiences are very new and it must be quite intimidating, but this is something they can visually excel at, and it\u2019s an expression for them that doesn\u2019t involve their use of language completely.\u201d Schools involved in the programme have worked clay into subjects across the curriculum, from science to English, history and art. In maths, students will use clay to learn geometry, shapes and angles. It is too early to say how the novel approach has affected exam results, but teachers say children appear more engaged and that there has been an increase in those choosing to study arts subjects at GCSE \u2013 bucking a national trend. \u201cIt\u2019s done wonders,\u201d says Alison Wilson-Hart, head of art at St Peter\u2019s academy, a secondary school on the other side of the river Trent. \u201cSome boys can be quite all over the shop. Give them a piece of clay and they\u2019re engaged.\u201d It is not only Stoke\u2019s skyline that has changed since its pottery heyday: every school in the city is thought to have had a kiln until recently, but as its main industry declined, so did the necessity\u00a0to teach it to the next generation. St Peter\u2019s switched its long-dormant kiln back on last month and Katie Leonard, the director of the clay schools programme, wants every school in Stoke to follow suit. Leonard says she is concerned that the arts are being squeezed out of the curriculum through government policies and education cuts , and that there is a \u201cnational tide of diminishing opportunity to work with ceramics\u201d in schools. By including clay work in core subjects, every child in Stoke should be able to explore a skill that might otherwise have been beyond their grasp. \u201cIt should be for every child in the city and I\u2019m concerned that art will become an after-school activity and then it becomes elitist again,\u201d she says. At St Peter\u2019s, clay\u2019s unlikely comeback appears to have fired up students\u2019 pride in the Potteries. The city, like many others in post-industrial areas, has struggled to overcome the decline of its industry. But there is now a real buzz about the city\u2019s future among children who are once again considering a career in ceramics, says Leonard. \u201cThe children over the years have been so negative about where they live, you know: \u2018Stoke: nothing goes on here.\u2019 A lot of them just want to leave when they grow up,\u201d she says. \u201cNow there\u2019s more of a buzz and children are starting to see a connection between what their grandparents did, or their parents, and the future. It\u2019s not just a dead industry, you can do something with it.\u201d For Lizzie Critchley, 13, an art student at St Peter\u2019s, pottery might well be something she pursues as a career, following in the footsteps of her grandfather, who worked in one of the city\u2019s many factories. \u201cIt\u2019s what we were known for \u2013 we had a skyline full of bottle kilns.\u201d Her classmate, Jorja Wright, 14, says she was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d when she turned over a plate on a family holiday in Florida two years ago to discover it was made in her home town. Ceramics is probably not in her future plans but Jorja is enjoying rolling her sleeves up for now: \u201cYou get to do whatever you want, there\u2019s no rules.\u201d", "author": "", "lang": "en"},

The survey showed his La R\u00e9publique en Marche party on 32% of the vote, up six points since the 7 May election and well clear of its centre-right Les R\u00e9publicains rivals on 19%. A day after Macron unveiled his cabinet \u2013 an equal number of men and women from the left, right and centre, plus many newcomers to politics \u2013 another poll showed 61% approval for his ministerial choices. The polls boost Macron\u2019s chances of securing an all-important majority in parliament to implement his promised reforms, although France\u2019s two-round voting system makes it notoriously hard to predict how many seats a party will win. L\u2019Obs cited three anonymous sources with knowledge of the emergency plan that would have been put into effect had Le Pen reached the Elys\u00e9e palace, saying it was devised by a small group of ministers, chiefs of staff and top civil servants. The magazine said the plan was aimed mainly at preventing serious civil unrest and \u201cfreezing\u201d the political situation by convening parliament in emergency session and maintaining the outgoing prime minister in office. Police and intelligence services were particularly concerned by the threat of \u201cextreme violence\u201d from mainly far left protesters in the event of a Le Pen victory as the country would have found itself \u201con the brink of chaos\u201d. Even before the first round of voting on 23 April , a confidential note drawn up by the intelligence services announced that \u201cwithout exception, every local public safety directorate has expressed its concern\u201d, Le Parisien reported . Regional police chiefs were asked on 21 April to detail their crowd control and deployment plans, l\u2019Obs said. Under France\u2019s ongoing state of emergency, more than 50,000 police and gendarmes and 7,000 soldiers were already on duty. On 5 May, two days before the second round that Macron won by 66% to Le Pen\u2019s 34%, the national public safety directorate warned in another note that protesters were ready to use \u201cfireworks, mortars and incendiary bombs\u201d. Fears of political instability if the anti-immigration, anti-EU Front National leader had been elected were equally acute. Although he subsequently denied saying so, French media reported before the election that if Le Pen won, Socialist prime minister Bernard Cazeneuve would stay on at least until the parliamentary polls. France\u2019s constitution does not oblige a prime minister to step down when a new president is elected. Under article 8, \u201cthe president appoints\u201d prime ministers \u2013 but only parliament can remove them from office, through a vote of no confidence. Le Pen could in principle have invoked article 16 of the constitution, allowing a president \u201cextraordinary powers\u201d in an acute emergency. But short of that, without a parliamentary majority she would not have been able to appoint a new premier. According to l\u2019Obs, the emergency plan also called for parliament to be convened in emergency session on 11 May, four days after the second round, to address the predicted \u201cnational crisis\u201d precipitated by Le Pen\u2019s election. Faced with mounting civil disorder and demanding France\u2019s 577 MPs step up to their \u201crepublican responsibilities\u201d, the government was then to have called \u2013 and, presumably, won \u2013 a motion of confidence. The will of the electorate would have been respected: the presidency would have passed from Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to Le Pen. But the government, officials said, would have assured \u201cthe security of the state \u2026 Government is about planning ahead.\u201d ", "author": "", "lang": "en"}
