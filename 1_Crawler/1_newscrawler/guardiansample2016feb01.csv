A slightly higher proportion of the BME population attend university than their white British counterparts, but fewer achieve the “good” degree – a first or 2:1 – that is so important for future success. (A recent study has shown that BME graduates are less likely to be employed six months after graduating than their white colleagues, and earn less.) Of all UK-domiciled students graduating in 2013 across all universities, 33% more of the white cohort received a good degree than the BME cohort. This is in stark contrast to the position in schools, where many ethnic groups outperform white schoolchildren.
Don't let social mobility fade out in the noise of university reform Read more
We know from the research that this gap cannot be explained away by prior qualifications, subject of study or other student characteristics. Yet this disparity has not received the attention it deserves; perhaps it has been just too uncomfortable and difficult to deal with. At Kingston University we are determined to address this gap and are holding ourselves to account by making the gap a board-level key performance indicator. At the heart of our approach is a university-wide strategy and the use of the Guardian’s value-added methodology, which has allowed us to raise awareness by demonstrating clearly to our staff at faculty, school and course level how their BME students are falling short of the attainment we should be expecting given their entry qualifications and subject of study.
We do not have all the answers as to why this is – the issues are clearly complex – but we are committed to working with our staff and students to tackle this major failing in higher education.

• The Higher Education Act 2004 made university admissions a matter of academic freedom. If the government were serious about broadening access, it could amend the act to give the Office for Fair Access the power to ensure university admissions processes were fair, using information it already has. Unfortunately, the government’s recent green paper proposes the abolition of Offa.

A hundred judges and magistrates have received written threats connected to cases they presided over during the past five years, the Ministry of Justice has revealed.
The admission that those on the bench are subject to such a high level of intimidation comes after a whistleblowing legal action launched by a district judge highlighting courtroom dangers.
Claire Gilham’s claim before an employment tribunal includes details of a death threat she received while hearing family cases at Warrington county court.
The influx of unrepresented litigants in person, who are no longer entitled to legal aid to pay for lawyers, has added to the difficulties family judges face in controlling emotive child custody hearings.
Earlier this week Labour’s justice spokesman, Andy Slaughter, put down a written question seeking information on how many judges or magistrates received threatening correspondence relating to hearings they have presided over since 2011.
Replying, Shailesh Vara, the justice minister responsible for courts and legal aid, pointed out that there are around 20,000 judges and magistrates in England and Wales.
The annual figures show how many judges and magistrates in England and Wales reported receiving threatening correspondence: in 2011 – 20; in 2012 – 12; in 2013 – 19; in 2014 – 18; and in 2015 – 31.
Last year’s leap in numbers may be an indication of a growing problem. Slaughter, the MP for Hammersmith, said he was “shocked” at the figures he uncovered, and insisted the lord chancellor had a duty to “ensure the safety of everyone who works in our courts”.
At the end of last year, Slaughter obtained figures through another written question showing that nearly 7,000 knives had been confiscated at crown courts and magistrates courts in England and Wales during 2014/15. “This is breathtaking lawlessness which the government must tackle immediately in order to ensure the safety of court staff,” Slaughter said.
In his responses, Vara said: “We have a robust security and safety system in place to protect all court users. Any threats to judges or magistrates are taken extremely seriously, and within Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service there is a security team to co-ordinate effective judicial security and incident investigation, working closely with senior judiciary and police agencies to provide the necessary support.”"

Law|Surveillance|news,2016-02-01T14:46:15,guardian,Owen Bowcott|Scarlet Kim|Carly Nyst,Highly critical report says proposed legislation must be reviewed to ensure obligations on tech industry are clear,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/01/investigatory-powers-bill-snoopers-charter-lacks-clarity-mps-warn,"Investigatory powers bill: snooper's charter lacks clarity, MPs warn",en,UK|law,,"The government’s investigatory powers bill lacks clarity and is sowing confusion among tech firms about the extent to which “internet connection records” will be collected, a parliamentary select committee has warned.
The highly critical report by the House of Commons science and technology committee says there are widespread doubts about key definitions in the legislation, “not to mention the definability, of a number of the terms”.
The admission that many MPs and technology experts are baffled will reinforce political concerns that such a complex bill is being pushed through parliament at speed. Other select committees are meanwhile preparing assessments of different aspects of the bill.
Investigatory powers bill: the key points Read more
Launching the report, the Conservative MP Nicola Blackwood, who is chair of the committee, said: “It is vital we get the balance right between protecting our security and the health of our economy. We need our security services to be able to do their job and prevent terrorism, but as legislators we need to be careful not to inadvertently disadvantage the UK’s rapidly growing tech sector.
“The current lack of clarity within the draft investigatory powers bill is causing concern amongst businesses... The government must urgently review the legislation so that the obligations on the industry are clear and proportionate.
“There remain questions about the feasibility of collecting and storing internet connection records (ICRs), including concerns about ensuring security for the records from hackers. The bill was intended to provide clarity to the industry, but the current draft contains very broad and ambiguous definitions of ICRs, which are confusing communications providers. This must be put right for the bill to achieve its stated security goals.”
The collection of ICRs is to allow law enforcement agencies to identify the communications service to which a device has connected. The report calls on the government to ensure that obligations it is imposing on industry are both clear and proportionate.
The committee accepts the principle that intelligence and security agencies should “in tightly prescribed circumstances be able to seek to obtain unencrypted data from communications service providers”.
The report says: “However, there is confusion about how the draft bill would affect end-to-end encrypted communications, where decryption might not be possible by a communications provider that had not added the original encryption.
“The government should clarify and state clearly in the codes of practice (which will be published alongside the bill itself) that it will not be seeking unencrypted content in such cases, in line with the way existing legislation is currently applied.”
Commenting on encryption, Blackwood said: “Encryption is important in providing the secure services on the internet we all rely on, from credit card transactions and commerce to legal or medical communications.
“It is essential that the integrity and security of legitimate online transactions is maintained if we are to trust in, and benefit from, the opportunities of an increasingly digital economy. The government needs to do more to allay unfounded concerns that encryption will no longer be possible.”
Privacy watchdog attacks snooper's charter over encryption Read more
The MPs said the evidence they received suggested there were still many unanswered questions about how this legislation would work “in the fast moving world” of technological innovation. “There are good grounds to believe that without further refinement, there could be many unintended consequences for commerce arising from the current lack of clarity of the terms and scope of the legislation,” they added.
Antony Walker, deputy CEO of techUK, which represents the technology industry, said: “There are several important recommendations in this report that we urge the Home Office to take on board. In particular we need more clarity on fundamental issues, such as core definitions, encryption and equipment interference.
“These are all issues that we highlighted to the committee and can be addressed both in the bill and in the codes of practice which we believe must be published alongside the bill, and regularly updated, as recommended by the committee. Without that additional detail, too much of the bill will be open to interpretation, which undermines trust in both the legislation and the reputation of companies that have to comply with it.
“The draft bill presents an opportunity for the UK government to develop a world-leading legal framework that balances the security needs with democratic values and protects the health of our growing digital economy. But we have to get the details right.”
Matthew Rice, advocacy officer at Privacy International, said: “The home secretary introduced the draft investigatory powers bill as a ‘gold standard’ for surveillance legislation. Yet the bill is quickly tarnishing under scrutiny. Civil society, industry and now the science and technology committee all agree that the draft bill raises substantial concerns because of its lack of clarity and intrusive proposals.
“The committee’s report shows that the safety and security of users’ data may be threatened. The draft bill must be substantially revised or it will put the UK economy, as well as our privacy and security, at risk.”
Silkie Carlo, technology and surveillance policy officer for Liberty, said: “Today MPs confirm what campaigners and tech experts have been telling the government for months – the draft bill’s lack of clarity in defining or limiting surveillance powers puts us all at risk. Business is no exception.
“The forced removal of encryption from services like WhatsApp, mass hacking authorised on a whim and records of the population’s internet history would severely undermine the UK’s technology sector.
“The loss of public trust in UK tech services that the report describes is reflective of the loss of trust in freedom of expression and privacy online – trust that would be impossible to regain. It’s no wonder the industry is concerned.”"

The days are rapidly getting longer, by about four minutes, and it is marked as a significant day in many cultures. February 2 is celebrated by Christians as Candlemas, when the church candles are blessed, and by pagans as the Festival of Light. In America it is Groundhog Day, when this animal’s behaviour is said to foretell whether spring is coming.
Weatherwatch: Candlemas and the folklore factor Read more
In parts of Europe this folktale involves the hedgehog. On either continent if the animal emerges from the ground and can see his shadow he returns immediately to hibernation knowing that winter is set to continue. A British folklore rhyme about Candlemas “being sunny and bright, winter will have another flight, and if Candlemas be cloudy with rain, winter is gone and won’t come again”, makes roughly the same prophesy.
This midwinter day, after the wild, wet and mild weather of the last two months, many would welcome animals seeing their shadows and hope it heralded a spell of frosty dry weather to bring the seasons back towards a normal pattern.
But judging by the latest science published on Friday, looking at European weather over the last 30 years, we have already irrevocably changed our climate.
Meteorologists are still reluctant to give weather forecasts for more than six days in advance, and hedgehogs being in short supply in Britain, it is hard to tell what the rest of the winter has in store. But looking at computer predictions for the direction and speed of the jet stream, more warm, wet weather is on the way."

The sky is overcast and the air smells softly of smoke in the still, snow-muffled high reaches of Annandale above Moffat. From within a dark stand of conifers comes a chirping as soft as grasshoppers. The source is a band of coal tits, their subtle winter-coloured plumage a match for the surrounding environment.
These birds are biologically distinct in part because of their adaptations to life in coniferous woodland, with a more slender beak than blue or great tits. Tiny tufts of snow sit precariously on the sprigs of the branches but somehow stay in place as the birds rummage within the needles for insect food, so delicate is their fidgety but precise work.
In the otherwise motionless valley, these small spirits kindle the life of the land.
The day before, on a plane returning from Kerala, I had looked down from the stratosphere as the frozen Kurdistan and Armenian highlands rolled underneath, a thousand miles of meringue-white mountains and stratovolcanoes passed over in a couple of hours. As the plane slowed on its approach to Edinburgh, the landscape of southern Scotland rose up, blanketed in snow and bell-clear in the sun, as gleaming and sterile as a laboratory compared with the torrid tropics I had left a hermetic few hours ago. Solid black conifer plantations were strewn over smooth white contours like offcuts of carpet, so different to the vast Eurasian conifer forests in which coal tits would have evolved.

Now, peering closely into the depths of a similar border country plantation was a comforting return to earth. I imagined I’d undergone a miraculous act of shrinking, exchanging a serenely omnipotent perspective for that of a tiny creature so I could scrutinise the earth up close.
But while I had been enjoying a sojourn in the baking heat of a south Indian winter, these coal tits were roaming through dark, snow-dusted stands of spruce and pine, restless in the search for sustenance. We inhabit the same earth but live in different worlds. I can fly at liberty around mine but cannot hope to enter theirs.

What does Dundee do better than anywhere else?
Reinvention. Scotland’s fourth city has often been seen as a poor relation to Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen but has fashioned an entirely new identity for itself – and is finally taking advantage of its stunning location.

Smoking|World Health Organization|Health,2016-02-01T01:01:13,guardian,Haroon Siddique,"Cigarette companies are turning to film industry to recruit next generation of smokers, warns World Health Organisation",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/01/films-portraying-smoking-should-get-adult-rating-says-who,"Films portraying smoking should get adult rating, says WHO",en,UK|society,,"Films showing smoking should be given an adult rating to protect children from exposure to the “last frontier” in tobacco promotion, the World Health Organisation has said.
Hoping to highlight the issue in the run-up to the Oscars, WHO said that as countries crack down on tobacco advertising and sponsorship, cigarette companies are turning to the film industry to recruit the next generation of smokers.
In its report, Smoke-free Movies, published on Monday, WHO cites statistics claiming that 44% of all Hollywood films, and 36% of films rated for young people in 2014 contained smoking.
It illustrates the exposure this gives the deadly habit with the example of Transformers: Age of Extinction, which features a cigar-smoking robot.
In 2014, the film delivered a total of 2.6bn “impressions” of tobacco use, which they calculate by a film’s tobacco incidents multiplied by its paid cinema admissions, in China alone, according to the report.
Dr Armando Peruga, programme manager of WHO’s tobacco-free initiative, said: “We saw for a while a decrease in the tobacco incidences in films and other entertainment productions. But based on what we monitored, we saw, in 2013-14, a turning point, a picking up of the number of tobacco scenes.
“The tobacco industry has been looking at alternatives to promote their products and films is the last frontier for tobacco companies.”
WHO first called for films featuring smoking to be restricted to adult audiences – generally those aged 18 or over but the age of majority varies by country – in 2009.
Peruga said it had renewed its campaign because no government had implemented the recommendation and amid fears that, as countries implement a WHO convention to ban tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, films become seen as a lucrative alternative.
A US study suggests that on-screen smoking accounts for 37% of all new adolescent smokers. In 2014, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that exposure to on-screen smoking would recruit more than 6 million new, young smokers from among American children in 2014, of which 2 million would ultimately die from tobacco-induced diseases.
Peruga said that attempts, largely in the US, to persuade film companies to comply with two other recommendations of the report – not to show brands and to include a statement in the credits saying that film producers receive nothing of value in exchange for tobacco products appearing – had fallen on deaf ears.
A study of the 15 most commercially successful films in the UK between 1989 and 2008 found tobacco in 70% of all films, 92% of which were rated for children aged younger than 18. Specific brands appeared in 9% of films and was nearly twice as likely to occur in films originating wholly or in part in the UK.
“In some films the percentage of tobacco scenes are far greater than you would see in the society in which the film is set,” said Peruga.
The British Board of Film Classification said the public agreed that the classification of smoking in films should be proportionate and reflective of UK laws, so an adult smoking should not instantly require an 18 classification. But it said glamorisation of smoking was more likely to receive a higher classification.
Simon Clark, the director of the smokers’ group Forest, said: “Disney has a no smoking policy for its PG 13-rated films, and that’s fine, but films aimed at older audiences must be allowed to reflect real life, not some sanitised smoke-free world.
“Penalising films that portray smoking by giving them a rating equivalent to an 18 certificate is a clumsy and unnecessary attempt at censorship.”"

Monday
My role is to assess and help elderly patients stay at home and so reduce inappropriate hospital admissions. As soon as I walk in the door I can tell it’s bad. “Everyone’s out,” gasps the coordinator, staggering over with an armful of equipment. “All the clinicians are doing care calls. We took so many referrals over the weekend.” She dumps the equipment on her desk and stands looking at it helplessly. “I can’t do this,” I think.
My first visit sets the tone for the day: an elderly woman with Alzheimer’s lying in bed. Her husband was the carer, their daughter tells me, but he’s now in hospital. The woman’s mobility is poor, exacerbated by a urinary tract infection, and the daughter isn’t able to help me move her. I can feel my back protesting as I struggle to lift the patient to clean her. I should wait for assistance, but there won’t be any. Everything’s failing, especially me.
Tuesday
A crisis is acknowledged and a meeting held. Extra bank staff are hired – many of them are like battle-worn mercenaries who know the score better than anyone. The extra staff act as a bracing shot in the arm and immediately ease the workload. I’ll have more time for the patients such as William and Jean.
Jean has Parkinson’s disease. “Forty-five years we’ve been married,” says William. “You have your ups and downs. Sometimes I think I should just take a load of pills and end it all, but then – what would happen to Jean?” We talk about ways to make things better – GP review, psychiatric assessment, respite care, time away. “It helps just to have you sit and listen,” he says.
Wednesday
The majority of our referrals are elderly patients coming to the end of their ability to cope at home. We make what improvements we can, installing equipment, offering physiotherapy, putting in temporary care workers until other agencies can pick up. All the patients have suffered an acute medical crisis, but some are less dramatic than others. Lionel, 96, still lives independently in the top flat of a converted Georgian townhouse. Lionel is so lovely, it’s hard to focus on the purpose of the visit – a health screen to see how he’s doing after a recent exacerbation of gout. The relentless caseload of elderly people failing to cope at home takes its toll. Fortunately there are always patients such as Lionel to lift your spirits.
Thursday
Maybe it’s the sunshine, but all the patients seem charming today. Jack jokes with me while his wife sleeps in a chair, curled in on herself like a giant dormouse, pale and empty. I write a few notes; Jack staggers off to the kitchen, his left leg, which is bandaged, dragging. He returns and puts a plate in front of me, piled high with pink wafer biscuits.
Friday
It’s my day off. I go back to work tomorrow but for now it’s great to take our dog for a walk. Sometimes it’s hard not to think about some of the patients I’ve seen. Scenes of deprivation, isolation. How on earth did they end up like that? Could it happen to me?
Most difficult decision: I didn’t know if I was right to file a vulnerable adult report on a woman who refused help and had taken to her bed because she “just wanted nature to take its course”.
Most satisfying result: A few simple interventions for Lionel meant he was able to carry on as before. Finding and making those changes means it’s hard to seriously think about leaving my job.

GPs|Older people|Social care|Doctors|Health|NHS|news,2016-02-01T09:11:54,guardian,Damien Gayle,Family doctors say they are being stretched by government policies that are pushing patients who need specialist care back into the community,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/01/gps-defend-decision-to-stop-looking-after-care-home-residents,GPs defend decision to stop looking after care home residents,en,UK|society,,"Family doctors say they are being stretched by government policies that are pushing patients who need specialist care back into the community
Doctors’ leaders have defended a vote by GPs’ leaders to stop looking after care home residents, saying such patients have complex needs beyond the capacity of their practices.
Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the GP committee of the British Medical Association, said government healthcare policies were pushing back into the community many patients who previously would have been in long-term hospital care.
He denied accusations that family doctors were abandoning older patients, saying the decision – taken at an emergency summit over the weekend – was in recognition that such patients had needs that GPs were unable to meet.
Dr Nagpaul told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The problem we have got is that patients in care homes have additional complex needs who would have been in a hospital setting. You wouldn’t expect GPs for example to visit patients in hospital when they have been admitted to hospital.”
He said patients’ existing GP practices could continue to provide care, but under separate arrangements and not if it was too stretched. “This is a government policy of moving many ill patients, who need to be receiving specialist care, outside of a hospital setting,” he said. “The idea that GPs suddenly take on this work when in fact such patients do need specialist care ... What we have got at the moment is a contract that really makes no differentiation.”
GPs are currently obliged to carry out routine checkups once or twice a week for about 300,000 elderly people in care homes in England, as well as visiting any who suddenly become sick. Many require dedicated care and in the past would have been looked after in hospital.
At their special conference in London on Saturday, dozens of GPs’ representatives spoke about how the workload they faced increased the risks to patients and made their jobs increasingly unbearable. At the conference, Nagpaul said it was not safe to see patients with complex multiple needs in 10-minute consultations or have 70 patient contacts each day in a “conveyor belt” system.
The vote to remove responsibility for patients in care homes came as GPs discussed what work or services they should cease,to reduce their workload to ensure safe and sustainable patient care. It means that the BMA is now likely to lobby for the change when the government announces a new contract for GPs this month. Elderly people’s advocates expressed fears that the change could worsen care.
Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, told the Daily Mail: “Older people in care homes are just as entitled as anyone else to good NHS treatment and because many are frail and unwell. Continuity of care from a GP whom they get to know is especially important.
“We would be very concerned at any move which hived off healthcare in care homes into a separate category and which led to more fragmented GP care for residents from an ever-changing cast of characters.”
GPs have clashed with the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, over his plans for a seven-day NHS. Last year, Hunt was forced to defend England’s chief inspector of general practice after doctors called on him to resign.
Prof Steve Field, who is based at the Care Quality Commission, was criticised over comments he made saying he was “ashamed” of colleagues who provided poor care.
In a video message to the conference on Saturday, the health minister Alistair Burt said the government was increasing funding for GP services by between 4% and 5% over the course of this parliament and looking at measures to streamline bureaucracy, CQC inspections and the payment system.
He said: “I know that general practice is under pressure at the moment – I meet a lot of GPs up and down the country. But I’m also aware of what it is we are trying to do to help.”"

More than two-fifths of national health spending in the UK is devoted to people over 65, according to estimates produced for the Guardian by the Nuffield Trust – a figure that is only likely to increase with the nation’s ageing demographic.
The data shows that an 85-year-old man costs the NHS about seven times more on average than a man in his late 30s. Health spending per person steeply increases after the age of 50, with people aged 85 and over costing the NHS an average of £7,000 a year. Spending on health services across all age groups is £2,069, according to Treasury analysis.
The costs pressures are unlikely to abate. By 2039, people aged 65 or over are expected to represent 23% of the population, or 17.5 million, according to projections from the Office for National Statistics. About one in 12 of the population will be aged 80 or over by then.
Currently, there are 11.4 million people aged 65 or over in Britain, representing 18% of the total population, up from 12% in 1966.

“People in the UK live longer every year because we have learned to cure or prevent many of the diseases that once cut lives short,” said Mark Dayan, policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust. “Today, the NHS’s staff and technology, and therefore its money, is increasingly focused on treating people in older age groups, with often long-term conditions that we struggle most with. That’s a sign of success.
“But it means that as more people stay alive and grow older, the cost of healthcare rises each year by 1 or 2% on top of wages and costly new drugs,” he added. “To maintain and improve the health service, we need to constantly find more money or savings, usually both. This basic question of demographics and money lies behind most of the controversies across the NHS.”
Average spending is higher for males until they reach 15 and once again after their mid-60s. Once they hit 80, men cost the NHS 8% more on average than women of the same age.
Newborns also incur higher costs to the health services. In England, the Institute for Fiscal Studies [pdf] estimates hospital costs for boys at £1,504 in the first year of life, compared with £1,254 for baby girls. Newborns account for about 8% of hospital inpatients a year.
There were 776,352 live births in the UK in 2014, equivalent to 2,127 a day.
Dealing with complications at birth generates additional costs, the most common being jaundice and disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, both affecting 8% of newborns [pdf]. Failure to thrive – when the weight of a baby is insufficient – costs the NHS a minimum of £646 to treat.
Maternity plays a key part in explaining the cost difference between men and women in adult life. Hospital costs for women aged between 20 and 35 are at least twice those for men of the same age.
This increase in cost for women is partially offset by mental health spending, which is higher for men in their 20s and 30s.
The amount spent on health services varies between different parts of the UK. Expenditure is highest in Scotland, at £2,160 per person, and lowest in England at £2,057.
At a regional level, health spending was 23% higher in London than the England-wide average. The east, south-east and east Midlands recorded the lowest spending, with an average of less than £1,850 per person.
The data, which is based on identifiable expenditure (where the individuals who benefit from public spending can be located), shows that health spending per head is second only to social protection (£3,927), but ahead of education (£1,307), economic affairs (£582) and public order (£441).
Health is the service for which public expenditure has increased the most in the last 20 years. Treasury data shows that in real terms spending has more than doubled from £62.8bn in 1994-95 to £134.1bn in 2014-15. As a proportion of the nation’s GDP, health spending has increased from 5.2% to 7.3% in the same period."

The World Health Organisation has declared that the clusters of brain-damaged babies born in Brazil – linked to but not proven to be caused by the Zika virus – constitute a public health emergency of international concern.
The declaration, made by the WHO director Margaret Chan, will trigger funding for research to try to establish whether the Zika virus, spread by mosquitoes, is responsible for the large numbers of babies born with abnormally small heads in Brazil. It will also put resources behind a massive effort to prevent pregnant women becoming infected and, through mosquito control, stop the virus spreading.
Chan called the birth of thousands of babies with microcephaly “an extraordinary event and a public health threat to other parts of the world”. She was speaking following a meeting of the WHO’s international health regulations emergency committee, summoned to advise the director general on whether to make the declaration, which calls in international resources and expertise.
“Members of the committee agreed that the situation meets the conditions for a public health emergency of international concern. I have accepted this advice,” she said.
Chan, who was criticised for being slow to make a similar declaration while Ebola spread across west Africa, sidestepped the question when asked if she felt that was a factor in the response to the Zika crisis in Brazil.
“It is important to realise that when the evidence first becomes available of such a serious condition like microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities, we need to take action, including precautionary measures,” she said.
Tropical disease experts involved in the Ebola epidemic applauded the declaration. “The WHO faced heavy criticism for waiting too long to declare the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency and they should be congratulated for being far more proactive this time,” said Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. “Today’s declaration will give the WHO the authority and resources it needs to lead the international response to Zika.”
Chan called for countries to refrain from imposing any sort of travel restrictions on those Latin American countries where the Zika virus is spreading.
Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said: “A kneejerk response would be to ban travel and trade with countries affected, but the truth is that the potential problem is much wider. It wouldn’t really be feasible to lock down the affected countries to try to stop the spread of a virus that is carried by the Aedes mosquito, especially when affected and unaffected countries border one another.
“Until populations can build up sufficient immunity, either through natural infection or through vaccination, then the risk to pregnant women is real and therefore this group need to take extra care to avoid becoming exposed.”
Prof David Heymann, chair of the emergency committee, stressed that the most serious issue was not the Zika virus itself, which causes a mild illness, but the microcephaly cases in babies. “Zika alone would never be a public health emergency of international concern,” he said. “It is not a clinically serious infection.” For that reason, he said, it was a very difficult decision.
The microcephaly clusters so far have appeared in Brazil and – in 2014 before anybody realised the significance – Polynesia. That, said Heymann, showed “it appears to be spreading”.
Brazil has dispatched hundreds of thousands of troops on mosquito-eradication campaigns in the the worst affected areas, but the government is struggling to comprehend let alone cope with the epidemic.
While reported cases have spiked since the virus was first identified in the country last year, officials admit their estimate of 1.5m cases is based on guesswork.
Zika virus could be bigger global health threat than Ebola, say health experts Read more
“Eighty percent of the people infected by Zika do not develop significant symptoms,” the health minister Marcelo Castro told Reuters. “A large number of people have the virus with no symptoms, so the situation is more serious that we can imagine.”
In an effort to get a clearer picture, the authorities have instructed local health authorities to report on all cases from next week, when most states should have the equipment and personnel to carry out Zica tests. It will ban people who have the virus from donating blood.
Despite the lack of reliable data, Castro said researchers were convinced that the virus was the cause of a spike in reported cases of microcephaly. A link has not been proven, but concerns are growing because the disease and the abnormality have both risen sharply.
Brazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff, acknowledged at the weekend that the country was losing the battle. “We do not have a vaccine for Zika yet. The only thing we can do is fight the mosquito,” she told reporters during a visit to the emergency headquarters of the anti-Zika campaign. “As long as [the mosquitoes] are reproducing, we are all losing the battle. We have to mobilise to win it”.

Public health officials, backed by 220,000 troops, have stepped up efforts to kill breeding grounds of the Aedes mosquito, particularly in the poverty stricken northeast, where most cases have been concentrated.
On Monday, Rousseff signed a law allowing health officials access to any building to eradicate breeding grounds.
The new law allows health officials access to all homes, and public and private buildings, even if the property’s owner cannot be located. Officials can request backup from police to raid any building suspected of being a mosquito breeding ground.
An estimated 1.5 million Brazilians have caught Zika, a virus first detected in Africa in the 1940s and unknown in the Americas until it appeared in May. The Pan-American Health Organisation said the virus had since spread to 24 countries and territories in the hemisphere.
By next month, the labs will have a test that can detect all three viruses borne by the Aedes mosquito – dengue, Chikungunya and Zika. The test, however, will only be effective during the initial infection period of five days.

One of the main drivers of the WHO’s declaration of an emergency is to fund and launch studies to find out where there is a definitive association with the Zika virus. Chan said: The evidence is growing and it is getting stronger. We need a coordinated international response to get to the bottom of this.”
“It is a very complicated issue,” said Heymann. “To figure out the link with Zika virus, large numbers of cases of microcephaly have to be traced and assessed and the exposure of the mother to Zika virus has to be established. But the USA is working with Brazil and studies will start in the next two weeks.”
Chen said surveillance needed to be strengthened. Scientists involved in the studies will need reliable reports of every case of microcephaly, which may not automatically be reported to doctors, especially in remote and poorer areas of Latin America. The WHO declaration will also encourage research and development of a vaccine against the virus and reliable diagnostic tests.
However, the Brazilian president’s chief of staff said on Monday it would take researchers between three and five years to develop a vaccine against the virus.
Jacques Wagner told reporters that Brazilian researchers are working with researchers in the United States.
In his words, “If we are really lucky, it could be three years. But it could be between three and five years.”"

Heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath have postponed two shows on what they say will be their final tour after frontman Ozzy Osbourne, 67, fell ill.
Black Sabbath scrapped plans to play Saturday in Edmonton, Alberta and announced that the band would also push back another Canadian show scheduled for Monday in Calgary.

The band said in a statement that it was postponing the shows as Osbourne suffers “extreme sinusitis” and that the concerts would be rescheduled, with dates to be announced later.
Black Sabbath on 20 January opened a tour in Omaha, Nebraska, that will crisscross the world before ending back in the US on 21 September in Phoenix, Arizona.
The British band, whose influential first album came out in 1970, has vowed that the concerts will be the last and called the tour “The End.”
Osbourne is one of the quintessential figures in heavy metal, known for his fascination with the occult and on-stage theatrics. He has gone on to have a successful solo career.

Proposals for Havana’s old harbour are described as ‘Las Vegas meets Miami in the Caribbean’. So can the city cope with the commercial storm ahead?
In central Havana’s Parque Fe del Valle, at the end of a street bustling with the usual scenes of queues for the bakery and clapped-out 1950s cars weaving between piles of rubble, is a glimpse of a very different Cuba. Every bench, wall, dustbin and plant pot in this tree-lined square is occupied by bodies hunched over laptops and gathered around smartphones, as people swipe at tablets and gesticulate at their screens.
Three generations of one family are huddled around a phone, the children fighting over who gets to wear the headphones while the granny holds a baby up to the camera – so that relatives in Miami, who they haven’t seen for years, can inspect the family’s new arrival. Nearby, two brothers scroll through Facebook to check the latest enquiries for their bed-and-breakfast business, their laptop balanced on a makeshift desk of crates, while a gaggle of teenage girls stream music and practise dance moves under a tree.
This lively scene, which looks like an impromptu secondhand technology fair, is the result of a new phenomenon in Cuba: Wi-Fi hotspots. In a country where the internet is still forbidden in private homes and an hour checking emails at an internet cafe can cost nearly a week’s wages, the arrival of five designated Wi-Fi zones in Havana has been nothing short of revolutionary.
Walk along La Rampa by night, the long people-watching road that slopes up from the seafront into the neighbourhood of Vedado, and you’ll see huddles of ghostly faces, illuminated only by the glow of screens. These sprawling open-air internet lounges have also spawned a new informal economy. Wi-Fi touts wander the streets like drug-pushers, re-selling the state telecom company’s prepaid $2 scratch-off cards for $3 apiece, muttering “cards, cards?” instead of the usual “hashish? girls?”. Snack stalls and drinks stands – private enterprises that would have been forbidden five years ago – have sprung up to fuel the spontaneous street-corner parties, where people gather around to watch the latest Hollywood trailers on YouTube.

“We are seeing a whole new quality of public space,” says Miguel Antonio Padrón Lotti, a Cuban professor of urban planning, who worked at the country’s National Physical Planning Institute for 45 years. “Cubans have always socialised on the streets, but now we can interact with the wider the world at the same time.”
The wider world is arriving here in ever bigger droves, and not just through the internet. On the cobbled streets of Habana Vieja, the beautifully restored old town, it can now be hard to move for the throngs of package tour groups. They follow their flag-toting guides between cafe-lined squares, shuffling from the Museo del Chocolate, past living statues and outposts of Victorinox and Diesel, to boutique shops housed in majestic old mansions where handmade watches are on sale for $12,000.
Not long ago, all this was crumbling. The improbable transformation is the work of the Office of the City Historian, a vast state department of architects and planners headed up by Eusebio Leal Spengler since 1981. Wielding unheard-of power for an architectural historian, equivalent to that of a mayor, he has won plaudits from Unesco and heritage bodies around the world for what he’s achieved here over the last 30 years, against all the odds.

In the early 1990s, Leal persuaded Fidel Castro to set up a state-owned tourism enterprise, Habaguanex: a company charged with developing hotels, restaurants and shops. Crucially, it would plough the profits back into restoring Havana’s derelict buildings and streets, as well as seeding social projects and community facilities. It was a canny model of capitalist tactics deployed for socialist ends, which has seen Leal’s office channel more than half a billion dollars into the old town. The company now presides over a growing empire of 20 hotels, 40 restaurants and 50 bars and cafés, as well as dozens of high-end boutiques.
But outside the tourist circuit of the four main plazas and the carefully repaved pedestrian routes that wind between them, two-thirds of the old town remains in a perilous state. Castro’s revolution was fundamentally anti-urban, focusing on restructuring the rural economy at the expense of the colonial capital, and the consequences are all too visible. Look beyond the newly polished stage-set facades, and you’ll still find families living several generations to a room in buildings that threaten to collapse around them at any minute.
Although half of the profits of Habaguanex are ploughed into social initiatives – including health clinics, schools, libraries and old people’s centres – the renovations have come at a price, exaggerating the divisions between the scrubbed-up and the squalid. Many former residents of these grand historic buildings have been rehoused far away from the centre, in the hated suburbs of Alamar and Habana del Este across the bay to the east. More look set to be displaced as the pressure to accommodate foreign visitors only continues to rise.

One local cafe owner, who used to live in an historic building in the old town with 20 other families, now has to travel two hours a day to get into work, since his former home was renovated. But he has mixed feelings about the consequences. “The tourists might be pushing us further away,” he says, “but they’re also bringing in money that the city desperately needs. And our building was about to fall down anyway.”
As part of the growing restaurant industry, he benefits from being paid in the currency that foreigners have to use on the island – the convertible peso, or CUC – which, pegged to the US dollar, is 25 times more valuable than the local currency, the Cuban peso (CUP). It is a gulf that has effectively created two classes of citizen in this supposed land of equals: those with access to hard currency, and those without. “Life is better if you work for the tourists” is how one rickshaw driver puts it – as two middle-aged Americans struggle to get out of his fibreglass cabin, adding a generous tip on to the already over-priced fare.
Nothing is going to happen very quickly, for the simple reason that it takes so long to get anything done Belmont Freeman
More than 3 million tourists came to Cuba last year, boosted by a sharp increase in the number of US visitors, which has surged by almost 40% since Obama ushered in a thaw in diplomatic relations at the end of 2014. American citizens are officially still forbidden to travel here for the sole purpose of tourism, but the sanctioned categories of travelling to “support the Cuban people” and for “people-to-people activities” are vague enough to allow tour operators to thrive. American cruise-ship giant Carnival is already planning to bring “culturally themed” cruises here from May, making it the first such cruise company to visit Cuba since the 1960 trade embargo. According to the IMF, an end to the embargo could see as many as 10 million US tourists a year – a deluge for which the creaking, crumbling bones of Havana are far from prepared.
“The infrastructure just isn’t there to cope with such numbers,” says Belmont Freeman, a Cuban-American architect based in New York, who has made frequent trips to Havana over the last 15 years. “The city is woefully underserved for hotels and even if more were built, the services couldn’t supply them. The mains water system hasn’t been improved since the 1920s – it still loses around 50% through leakage.”
Not that this seems to be standing much in the way of the luxury hotel developers, who have their sights set on opportunities across the city. On the eastern side of Parque Central, just visible through a cloud of construction dust from nearby roadworks, stands the stately frontage of the Manzana de Gomez building, a classical pile that occupies an entire city-block, built as Cuba’s first shopping mall in 1910. Now entirely stripped out, it stands as an eery windowless shell, awaiting the opulent filling of a five-star Kempinski hotel planned to open later this year.

Around the corner, the Hotel Packard is being similarly spruced up and expanded by Spanish starchitect Rafael Moneo for Iberostar. Further north, near the package beach resort of Varadero, British property developer London & Regional has unveiled plans for The Carbonera Club,a $500m luxury development of 1,000 Conran-designed residences arranged around an 18-hole golf course. Taking advantage of a recent relaxation of regulations, it will allow foreigners to own beachfront property on the island for the first time. US chains such as Marriott and Hilton can do nothing but stand drooling from just 100 miles across the Straits of Florida, waiting for the embargo drop.
One insider describes some foreign developers’ proposals for the harbour as 'Las Vegas meets Miami in the Caribbean'
“I give it two years, max,” says Freeman. “It will be US business interests that finally push congress into lifting the embargo – they’re all going crazy being shut out of this market.” American architects and developers are already queuing up to be first in line, ready to pounce on investment opportunities when the embargo drops. Frank Gehry sailed into Havana in December, aboard a streamlined yacht he designed for himself, here to “offer his expertise to Cuba” according to a government statement.
“You know that Cuba is at the centre of attention of many people,” Gehry told the gathered crowd. “And in the immediate future it will attract many investors – particularly the tourism sector. But I am sure that you know to be careful with those projects.”
Jorge Pérez, a Cuban-American condo tycoon based in Miami, paid a visit to Havana for its art biennale last year. “I wish they would let me be the developer for all of this,” he told Miami newspaper el Nuevo Herald on his return. “I think I could change Havana in 10 or 20 years. If they opened things up and I could build a luxury condominium in Vedado, I would sell them in two hours here in Miami.”
It is the kind of prospect that worries Miguel Padrón, who is not sure that Havana is ready to cope with what developers are preparing to throw at it. “We will have many divas and divos arriving with their very nice drawings,” he says. “But as a society, we desperately need to improve our capacity to debate and discuss these plans. The challenge is how to capture the potential of the market in the right way, to learn how to negotiate with foreign investors. Havana is now the big cake – and everyone is trying to get a slice.”

All eyes are focused on bay of Havana itself, once the source of the city’s immense wealth and now the place from which investors are hoping to extract an even bigger bounty. With the opening of a new $900m port 30 miles west of Havana at Mariel – built with Brazilian help – the old harbour now represents the next major development opportunity: a derelict jumble of warehouses and struggling fragments of industry.
“The harbour is the embryo of the city,” says José Antonio Choy Lopez, a Cuban architect who sits on the board of UNIAC, the Union of Cuban Writers and Artists: a body charged with assessing plans for the bay. As one of the best natural harbours in the Americas, enhanced by impressive fortifications in the 16th century, it was where the Spanish galleons assembled, laden with riches plundered from the New World, before sailing in protected convoys back to Europe. Huge quantities of gold and silver, along with Alpaca from the Andes, emeralds from Colombia and mahogany from Guatemala, were all traded here, bringing profits that are wrought in Havana’s palatial buildings. “It was a cultural crossroads, the very reason for the cosmopolitan character of the city,” says Choy. “And its redevelopment is now the most important project facing Cuba this century.”
For such an important project, precious little is actually known about the plans. Not that the sense of mystery is unusual. In Cuba, things are rarely announced until they actually happen. “They never publish targets here,” says one foreign diplomat, “because they usually don’t meet them.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest An informal street property market. Photograph: Oliver Wainwright
Choy talks of proposals to turn the harbour into a centre of “culture and recreation”: the redundant Tallapiedra power station might become an art gallery, along the lines of London’s Tate Modern, while the site of the Nico Lopez oil refinery across the bay, where a chimney still belches thick black smoke 24 hours a day, might be developed into a new city of science and technology. There is talk of transforming an elevated railway line into a linear park, like New York’s High Line, as well as plans for a big new transport hub next to the old train station.
Sensitively done, it could have a similar quality to harbour revitalisation projects such as San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf or Cape Town’s V&A Waterfront; the elegant steel-framed warehouses repurposed with minimal intervention. One such shed has already been reborn as a crafts market, while another recently reopened as a restaurant and microbrewery.
However, the future of such enterprises, post-embargo, could be precarious given the complex history of land ownership here. One US shipping company has an $850,000 claim on a kilometre stretch of the waterfront, including the brewery building, which they say was seized from them after the revolution. The same goes for many such buildings across the city and beyond, with the value of claims for confiscated US property totalling almost $8bn, including long-standing claims from the likes of Exxon, Texaco and Coca-Cola. Despite diplomatic talks, compensation issues have yet to be resolved.
There is also no guarantee that the next stages of the harbour redevelopment will be as low-key as the warehouse renovations completed so far. Havana may well find itself catapulted from having too little money to having too much, too fast, with all the usual consequences. One insider describes some foreign developers’ proposals for the harbour as looking like “Las Vegas meets Miami in the Caribbean”.

Freeman is more optimistic. Havana will be saved from the worst effects of commercial speculation, he thinks, by a combination of glacial Cuban bureaucracy and happy accident. “Nothing is going to happen very quickly, for the simple reason that it takes so long to get anything done,” he says. “Other countries have been trying to develop in Cuba for decades, and they’ve been stymied all along by the country’s sclerotic controls over every aspect of economic activity.” The harbour will also be protected from the “Venice syndrome” of vast cruise-ships dwarfing the city with their stacked cliff-faces of cabins, he says, because the boats simply won’t be able to get in. A road tunnel, laid across the bottom of the bay in a big concrete tube in the 1950s, makes it too shallow for them to enter.
At the other end of the scale from the grand waterfront plans, there are signs across the city of a new kind of real-estate development. Scaffolding has long shrouded much of Havana, but it no longer just signals the work of the City Historian. Recent changes to property laws, which have allowed Cubans to buy and sell their own homes for the first time in years, paired with a relaxation of US rules on how much money Cuban-Americans can send to their family back home, have spawned a micro-real estate industry of independent renovation. Families with access to cash from overseas are doing up crumbling buildings themselves and either letting them out as holiday rentals (possible through Airbnb since last year) or selling them on – minting a wealthy new class in the process.

It is a change in legislation that foreign companies have been quick to pounce on. Choy is currently putting the finishing touches to the renovation of a building on the waterfront, working closely with Cuba Real Tours – one of a growing number of companies developing boutique holiday lets across the city.
They have encountered the chief difficulty of anyone trying to do construction work in Cuba: the dearth of materials. Glass still isn’t produced on the island, so each window has to be imported – and the customs limit of four windows per person, or two doors, mean these small-scale refurbishments often entail getting friends and family to help out.
But such obstacles certainly haven’t limited the aspirations of would-be developers, or the level of quality that they can achieve with a bit of Cuban resourcefulness. Freeman describes an “eye-popping” day he spent with one of Havana’s fledgling estate agents, touring spectacular 1950s houses that had been fixed up extraordinarily lavishly and are now being offered for up to $800,000.
Elsewhere there are penthouses listed for more than $2m, although no one knows how much anything is really worth: there are no benchmarks and no mortgage industry. Instead, people gather at the end of Paseo del Prado, standing with handwritten signs around their necks, displaying faded photos of apartments for sale, and browsing listings written in dog-eared exercise books. It is one of the many strange scenes in Havana of micro-capitalism at work – which clearly won’t be micro for much longer.

An emergency World Health Organisation committee is meeting on Monday to advise on the response to the Zika virus, as the number of infected people continues to soar.
Zika virus could be bigger global health threat than Ebola, say health experts Read more
The committee will decide whether to designate the mosquito-borne virus – which has been linked to serious birth defects – a global emergency meriting immediate coordinated international action, amid criticism that it has been too slow to act.
On Thursday, WHO’s director general, Margaret Chan, said the virus was spreading explosively. The latest figures from Colombia, released over the weekend, backed her analysis, showing 20,297 confirmed cases of the disease in the South American country, including 2,116 pregnant women, making it the second most affected country after Brazil.
According to Colombian officials, the number of pregnant women confirmed to be affected has doubled in a week.
In Brazil, Zika has been linked, although not definitively so, to 4,000 cases of microcephaly, in which babies are born with smaller than normal heads, raising global fears about a virus that was previously considered relatively benign.

Concerns have been amplified by the fact that the Olympics take place in Rio de Janeiro this summer, when about half a million tourists are expected to visit the city.
The WHO, which says there could be as many as 4m clinical cases of Zika in the Americas – although some experts think the figure could be much higher – is under pressure to come up with a speedy and effective plan of action.
The scientist who co-discovered Ebola has urged WHO to learn from its mistakes on its handling of that virus by quickly declaring a global health emergency over Zika.
Prof Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “By any means this [Zika] is a public health emergency – with the sheer number of people coming down with a flu-like syndrome”. The fact that some people developed neurological symptoms and the impact on the foetus were also a concern.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Piot added: “WHO clearly dropped the ball when it came to responding to the Ebola virus. It took about five months to declare the Ebola virus in west Africa as a public health emergency of international concern. Today that [WHO] committee is meeting and I have all confidence that they will declare this as a public health emergency. Several reports have been published [on the response to Ebola] and the WHO can, and must, do better.”
Piot said there was little danger of Zika spreading to the UK. “Zika and Ebola are different. The mode of transmission is different, that’s why I’m not concerned for the UK. There is no way that the aedes mosquito can spread here, it is too cold.”
Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University in Washington, US, who has worked with WHO and written extensively about pandemics and policy, said Zika should have been declared an emergency as soon as the link between the virus and microcephaly was made. “My chief criticism is of WHO in Geneva,” he told Reuters. “After being widely condemned for acting late on Ebola, it is now sitting back with Zika.”
But officials at WHO, the United Nations health organisation, say the precise nature of any link between Zika and microcephaly remains unclear.
Although the disease does not pose the same threat to life as Ebola, and there has only been one case of possible person-to-person sexual transmission, according to the WHO, experts have warned that Zika poses a serious threat because of a number of its characteristics. These include the fact that an estimated 80% of infected people do not have any symptoms and that there is no vaccine in prospect.
The Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that transmit the virus thrive in urban conditions and are spreading as global warming takes effect.
An Indonesian research institute said on Sunday that it had found one confirmed Zika case on Sumatra island in a 27-year-old man who had never travelled overseas. The virus has previously been detected in a small number of people in south-east Asia, including one case in Indonesia, reports suggest. The Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology in Jakarta, said it concluded that the virus had been circulating in the country “for a while”."

But cash-strapped Brazil can’t pay",https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/01/funding-problems-hit-plan-clean-rios-polluted-waterways-olympics,Funding problems hit plan to clean Rio's polluted waterways ahead of Olympics,en,world|americas,,"With the Olympic Games just months away, Rio de Janeiro has a problem: rubbish. Hundreds of tonnes of unprocessed waste flow into the Guanabara Bay every year. The problem isn’t new but the prospect of Olympic swimmers and sailors taking to Rio’s contaminated waters have put the issue in the spotlight.
Previous promises from Rio officials to “regenerate Rio’s magnificent waterways” through investment in sanitation have not delivered results. Could the Dutch environment ministry have better luck? In an ambitious and diplomatically unorthodox move it has pulled together some of the country’s leading waste experts, including businesses and NGOs, to propose a variety of innovative solutions under the name Clean Urban Delta Initiative [pdf].
Athletes at Rio Olympics to compete in 'basically raw sewage', study reveals Read more
“Guanabara Bay is so polluted that we need all hands on deck to solve this sooner rather than later,” says Yvon Wolthuis, a sustainability expert and co-developer of the Clean Urban Delta Initiative. “Plus, there’s so much happening in an urban bay environment like Rio that you can’t just rely on one governance model or technology to fix it.”
The initiative has backing from the World Bank and the Dutch Development Bank and aims to showcase Dutch water management expertise. It lays out 20 separate proposals to deal with Guanabara Bay’s water pollution and solid waste challenges.
The list of proposed solutions ranges from installing temporary water treatment plants and purifying water via “constructed wetlands” to creating carpets from recovered nylon fishing nets. The ideas put forward by the consortium are intended to be low-cost, high impact and quick to implement, says Wolthius.

One of these proposed solutions is a project to help Rio’s litter pickers get more value from plastic waste. Based on a collaboration between a group of local designers, environmental charity WWF and the non-profit Plastic Soup Foundation, the project revolves around a low-cost plastic shredder and moulding machine that waste pickers can use to make recyclable products like plastic statues.
An initial pilot is planned in a favela community on the Carioca River, close to the city’s iconic Christ the Redeemer statue. Daniël Poolen (nicknamed the “Eco Prof” thanks to a science show he presents on Dutch TV) is one of the driving forces behind the project. “Thousands of tourists climb up the hill beside this community every day,” says Poolen, “if the waste pickers can shred and mould the plastics they usually sell on, they can earn ten or twenty times what they earn now.”
He concedes that the Carioca River is only one of about 18 garbage-choked rivers that feed into Guanabara Bay. However, if local people see that money can be made by recycling plastic that would otherwise end up in the river, then they will be incentivizsed to do the same along Rio’s other river tributaries too, he says.

The problem is money. The price-tag for the litter picker scheme – which also includes an eco-trail along the Carioca River, with local people offering paid tours, and the renovation of Rio’s key water basins – is about 4m real (£700,000). Yet Brazil is suffering its worst recession for decades and Rio’s state government, which is responsible for the Guanabara Bay’s clean-up, is struggling. As a result, the Plastic Soup Foundation is having to search out private funds to get the project off the ground.
Dutch dredging company Royal IHC, a member of the consortium, has run into a similar barrier. It has developed a low-cost, versatile vessel specifically designed for urban bay areas such as Guanabara. The catamaran-style “waste harvester” uses a system of interchangeable barges and on-board storage to continuously harvest surface waste without having to frequently return to shore to unload.
“We hoped that Rio would be a good case study to pilot this new technology, but the funding isn’t there”, says company spokersperson Marjolein van Noort.
Another consortium member, Dutch engineering consultancy firm Tauw, experienced similar difficulties. Its solution is based on the construction of small polypropylene tubes on the riverbed and a permeable grid above that catch and store floating rubbish. Despite interest from the Rio state government, the funding to install the firm’s “eco-barrier” wasn’t forthcoming.
Henry Raben, head of site development at Tauw, estimates that installing the system on the six most polluted rivers feeding into the bay would cost about £4.6m. “But the clock is now running. To be ready for the Olympics, we’d ideally have installed the geotubes about six months ago.”

Brazil is a “very complex” market, says Wolthuis, who takes heart from the fact that the Dutch consortium’s package of solutions offers a template for clean-up efforts in other polluted deltas around the world.
“Our focus has been on Rio, but these ideas could just as easily be applied to Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta or Abidjan. None of these urban delta areas are currently addressing their waste problems from a joined-up, holistic point of view,” she argues."

KS In recent years in Peru those most vulnerable to the effect of the weather phenomenon known as El Niño are migrants who have come from inland regions and settled on unclaimed land, on coastal areas near the bigger cities. These shanty towns are often in locations highly susceptible to the effects of extreme climate events.
My name is Kary Stewart and this month I visit Chosica, on the outskirts of Lima, and Piura, in the north of the country, to find out more about how the residents are dealing with the consequences of El Niño.
WZ My name is William Zegarra and I work for the NGO Practical Action here in Chosica. Now we are in the area of San Fernando. This is the Rímac river, our famous Rímac river.
KS We’re in San Fernando in the district of Chosica on the outskirts of Lima province, a about an hour from the capital’s centre. The poorer inhabitants live in the valley along the river Rímac and on the mountainside, and sometimes in the creeks themselves, mostly in basic structures built from brick and scrap material. When the heavy rains come every year in around March the area becomes susceptible to both landslides, which plummet down from the creeks in the mountains, and also to floods from the river bursting its banks.
WZ In 1987-88 we had El Niño and there was a lot of damage and victims because people hadn’t experienced landslides before and there hadn’t been any type of preparation. The whole risk management and civil defence system was very basic, practically non-existent in this area. Since then we have had the landslides every two or three years.

GP My name is Gabriela Perez. I am 16 years old and I live in Chosica on the outskirts of Lima. Where I live in Rayos del Sol there was a landslide last year. It come down through the mountain gorge where we least expected it, because seven years ago there was a landslide that came down from another part of the mountain and that’s where we expected it. The lady that collects recyclable goods lived in the path of the landslide. She wasn’t home but her daughter was there with her baby and her brother. That was the first family that suffered the effects of the landslide; and, unfortunately, many families lost their lives apart from them.
KS Manuel Pulgar-Vidal is the minister of the environment for Peru. He’s not so sure that El Niño was responsible for last year’s landslide, in which nine people lost their lives and six others went missing.
MP-V Nobody knows exactly if it were a problem with El Niño or some kind of winds with rain and clouds that came from the southern Antarctic part of the continent. Unfortunately poor people used to set their houses in those creeks, in the most vulnerable creeks. I think that we still have not really understood the risk that we are assuming when we put our house in that place.
KS Piura is in the far north of the country, and is set on desert scrub land. The shanty towns around the river Piura and beyond are highly vulnerable to the effects of flooding caused by heavy rains. Felix Zapata from NGO Practical Action works with the local community to help prepare them for the effects of El Niño.
FZ We have been working in three districts and in four communities. In the district of the 26 de Octubre we are working in Los Polvorines which is also an area that when the water level of the river rises it’s a lost area; and also in two other shanty towns. So the work that we have done in this area is [to] set up an irrigation route, making it wider and we have also built a retaining wall and have widened the entrance [so] the doctors, ambulances and the first response teams have easy access, and also so people can evacuate.
JN My name is Jenny Nesama. I also work for Practical Action in Piura. Los Polvorines is a shanty town that has been there for about 15 years and is growing. This is one of the most critical locations because it has been built on what used to be a lake, which means the soil isn’t the most sturdy. It is also where the natural drainage system used to run which used to offload the rainwater until it was invaded 15 years ago and now the people don’t want to leave.
KS Invasiones or invasions is a term used to describe the act of illegally settling on a piece of land. Typically most invasions are on land that has no clear owner, often because of its precarious location – such as near rivers, drainage systems or mountains which make them vulnerable to extreme conditions such as those caused by El Niño.
JN We have been working on prevention techniques with the people. If they are prepared this might at least save lives in the event of strong rains. We know that as an NGO it is not our responsibility to get them to leave the land; that is the municipality’s responsibility and also a much more complicated issue.
KS The district known as 26 de Octubre is an area settled through invasions and is currently in the process of becoming recognised as a formal town. Ana Chandovisi Esquen is president of the local organisation that looks after the residents’ rights. And she’s a well-known figurehead in the local area. I went to meet her at her home deep within the slums.
ACE I’ve been here for seven years. Others have been here for 11 years. There are around 700 plots; around 1,500 families multiplied by three or four would give you the inhabitants although some families are bigger. Life is a bit difficult here. There was one time when they wanted to evict us and that’s why they came to do a census as a trick. But as a leader we know how a census works and nobody can come and cheat us.
KS The cluster of villages where Ana lives huddle around a drain that comes from the city of Piura. The rainwater drain is called Victor Maldonado. It deposits its waters into the Santa Julia lake and eventually into the sea.
EAG My name is Eduardo Angulo Gonzalez. I’m the head of the department of the regional office for security and national defence. Our houses are located in low areas. In order to raise their homes to above flooding level they pile up the soil with construction material and say: “There, I’ve piled it up to the necessary height.” But when there are floods this material gets soaked anyway and [water] gets to the foundation of the houses which are made with the basic materials. The result is that the houses crumble. All these families are going to have problems when it rains. What they have to do is leave.
The humidity level of the soil there is very high, which isn’t good for the health of the children. All these people here are going to suffer with floods. The problem is that people are used to living close to the city, so if you offered them a safe plot two, three, 10 kilometres away, they don’t want to go there.
ACE We’re right next to the Los Patos lake. We can see a lot of contamination – building material. We’re in a shanty town, Armando Villanuevo del Campo, with a representative, Mr Leiter.
ML Of course, right now El Niño hasn’t happened but there is a possibility it could happen in March. And you can see that this part would be most affected. If this lake fills up the water will come this way and could bring disease. It should not be stagnant, it should run freely.
KS Back in Lima I asked Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the minister of the environment, why he thought people made their homes in these areas, despite knowing the risks.

MP-V This social phenomenon of invasion – it is related first to poor people who migrate mostly from the Andean part of the country, that is where the poorest people live. The cost of the land it is quite expensive for them so they are used to seeking outside the urban area or the main part of the urban area. Most of the time they are seeking to invade areas in which there are some probably lack of information [about] the owner, because if there is an owner obviously that owner is going to defend their land. So that is why they are used to going to the hills or close to the river, to the basin, and unfortunately [they] are the risk areas of our geography.
You know that when you are in poor conditions because of your economy, because of your way of life – that unfortunately your vision is a short-term vision. So that is why the people quickly forget the last El Niño and forget the risks because they need to have some place. They need to continue their activities, so that is why it is very difficult.
It is like, for example, the illegal mining. The people know that they are polluting the rivers and they are also creating a pollution problem with mercury. Yes, they know. But they think that probably in the future when they are with better life conditions they can deal with that. So it is a balance that is a trade-off. Now we need to have a house, economic activity … I know that there are some risks but they are used to assuming that risk. And that is sad because they know that they can suffer really bad consequences and [are] putting at risk their own life.
KS So in terms of the government, whose responsibility is all this?
MP-V You know that it is related to the land and to that kind of settlement. It is not related to the national government but to local government. So the local government needs to be more strong to have forbidden areas because they need to protect their own population. I think that one of the problems of Piura is that there are a lot of economic activities but based in an informal system. So that is why it is very difficult to adopt or to have a standard procedure to deal with the consequences of El Niño. You should go settlement by settlement to try and identify what kind of consequences they could have.
KS In Piura as in many vulnerable shanty districts the residents have become very proactive organising their own risk prevention techniques and learning about their rights.
JRP My name is Johans Rodriguez Purisaca. I’m 31 years old. I’m accompanied by my wife, Analia Inga Pedrera. We are members of the first brigade of the Polvorines; the first trained and certified brigade from the new district of 26 de Octubre in the shanty town of Polvorines. In May we started to form the civil defence platform. Everyone really persevered with the training. We did it with a lot of dedication and love. We have a certificate through the ministry of education and accredited by the district of 26 de Octubre that has recognised us as the first brigade of the district. They now count on us as the first response brigadiers for any emergency.
KS And then there is the work of the regional defence departments. Eduardo Angulo Gonzalez, the head of the regional office for security and national defence.
EAG This office has three lines of action: risk and disaster management; urban security; and national defence. You can see here on the whiteboard we are evaluating the sea temperature. We receive this information from the Peruvian Sea Institute. We also receive information from the Estudio Nacional del Fenómeno El Niño – Enfen. Six months ago they expected El Niño to be strong with disastrous effects. So it now has been changed into moderate, which means it won’t be a harmful event but it will rain.
KS The complex issues around illegal settlers are seemingly a long way from resolution. In the meantime, however, work continues to both manage risk and prevent disaster.
MP-V Even though we have received this good news that probably we are going to not have a strong El Niño, still we are working with a lot of money in preventive measures. The second measure is how we are going to manage an emergency. And the third part is to manage the rehabilitation in case we suffer the consequences, and a relocation, if it’s needed.

KS The regional governor of Piura.
RH We work on risk prevention on three levels: the national government; the regional government, who I represent as the governor; and the local government. The rural area is the responsibility of the national government and the agriculture ministry. On a local level in the cities it’s our job to clean the city drains which are the rain drains. We’re working on this with the help of the mayors and the housing ministry.
KS Back in Chosica the local residents are not convinced that the risk prevention work that the local authorities are doing is enough. Ana Ninahuanca Gómez is the president of the local residents’ group.
ANG Concerning the contingency plan, the local government hasn’t put anything forward. There have only been some minor training courses about that. So right now, the inhabitants themselves have their own contingency plan. If a landslide comes, they will go to higher areas for safety. We’re waiting for the authorities, the local authorities as well as the Lima regional authorities, because they were supposed to work on the dykes, and so far they haven’t. It’s only been the central government that has been putting the wire nets in, and getting money for the walls. We really don’t know what will become of the most vulnerable people when the rains start in March. We’re very worried.
We do feel a little more ready, because several organisations have come to prepare us on how to protect ourselves, in the event of a large landslide; what measures we could take. We would like more training for the communities, to know how to safeguard our lives, and those of our loved ones, and our neighbours and the elderly.
KS 16-year-old Gabriela Perez.
GP Apart from the fact that we learn how to raise awareness we are also learning that we have rights. The government could send us many things but you know there is a lot of bureaucracy, and essential goods don’t get here. That’s the reality for us. When they send supplies, they send beans and things like that. Can a six-month-old baby eat that? No. They have to eat baby food. In those moments all the shops close and the demand increases. We need to buy things but there’s nowhere to buy them. These are the things that I have been talking about with my peers and I know that we have to defend our rights.
KS So is it possible to forecast an El Niño?
MP-V No, no – who knows? You know that unfortunately the last statistics show that El Niño can appear every seven to 10 years. In the past it has been a larger time than current. So that is why we should be very, very aware that we can suffer continually that kind of effect.
KS In a country like Peru with so much institutional and cultural complexity, the work of trying to reduce the risk and protect the population from El Niño and other natural disasters is ongoing. Reynaldo Hilbert, the regional governor of Piura.
Hunger threatens millions as El Niño causes drought and floods Read more
RH What we’re doing now is recovering from the 1998 El Niño. The cities, the countryside and the highways are just as vulnerable as they were in 1998. I believe that if we want to overcome this problem we have to carry out major infrastructure improvements. El Niño is no longer a phenomenon. A phenomenon is every 500 years; and the El Niño event happens often now. During the past 30 years two of them have been very strong but in between we’ve had a lot of heavy rains. We now have to live with this event and we have to be prepared.

Environment|Opinion|Africa|Animals|Conservation|comment,2016-02-01T18:58:07,guardian,Patrick Barkham,"As a pilot is shot down trying to stop elephant poaching, the extent of big game slaughter is becoming clear. But we must get to the cause of the problem",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/elephants-pilot-poaching-big-game-slaughter,Elephants are being killed on a massive scale. There is a way to stop this,en,opinion,,"The death of the British helicopter pilot Roger Gower, shot down by elephant poachers over a game reserve in Tanzania, shows the dangers faced by the heroes attempting to save our most charismatic mammals from extinction.
We are in the midst of a crazy killing spree, the slaughtering of elephants, rhinos and lions on a scale never before witnessed on Earth. The 1989 ban on the international trade in ivory and conservation efforts that helped populations of big African animals recover in the 1990s now looks like a golden age. In 2007, 13 rhinos were poached in South Africa. In 2014, 1,215 were poached. Last year, numbers fell for the first time since 2007 – to 1,175. More than 129,000 elephants have been killed for their ivory since 2012.
In this climate, it is hard to regard good news with anything other than pessimism. Africa’s lion population is estimated to have halved since 1990 but scientists at Oxford University’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU) have discovered a previously overlooked population of up to 200 lions in national parks in Ethiopia and Sudan. These beasts won’t survive unless those countries can be helped to protect them.
What to do? Follow the money. For we know what lies behind the poaching epidemic: lucrative markets for rhino horn and ivory in China and Vietnam, and traditional Chinese medicine’s fetishisation of exotic animal parts. South-east Asian governments are not doing enough to stop industrial poaching; western leaders are not doing enough to force them to stop. This year, China’s government unveiled draft laws that confirm the legality of its exotic animal farms and allow local administrations to license trade in endangered species. This is a backwards step.
There is opportunity of sorts here. Endangered elephants, rhinos, lions and tigers are a gift to today’s distrusted governing elites. Stopping their slaughter would be tremendously popular. It is also a much easier win than the daunting, much trickier challenge of combating climate change. Tough, targeted sanctions would force south-east Asian governments to properly police the trade in endangered animal parts. Davos or the G20 could do something useful and bring charismatic megafauna back from the brink. That would be a turn-up wouldn’t it?
Pop-up parakeets
During the RSPB’s Big Garden Birdwatch last weekend, ring-necked parakeets were spotted in Glasgow. Thousands of these escaped pets now fly in London, and new Scottish populations shouldn’t be a surprise given that this species is happy in the Himalayas. Our actions are forcing animals and plants to change habits – or habitat – with disorientating speed. Still, it can be joyous when they do.
Whale of an apology
I recently walked across the marshes at Friskney, Lincolnshire, to find the fifth dead sperm whale. Unlike the other four whales stranded on popular beaches, this one was virtually unvisited. At first, it reminded me of a small submarine, an inanimate object, its dark-grey skin flaking like peeling paint. But when I tentatively touched its back, it became a he, a fellow mammal. He smelt sickly sweet, his blunt head raw red from his struggle in the North Sea’s treacherous shallows. So big, and so vulnerable. He was too large for us to help. Sometimes it feels like the problems we have created for all these big beasts become so large that we can no longer solve them. I said sorry. It seemed appropriate."

Veteran journalist and Wiradjuri man Stan Grant has said he would consider entering federal politics because of a responsibility he feels to continue to advocate for Indigenous Australians “who still suffer in this country”.
Grant, who is Guardian Australia’s Indigenous Affairs editor, made the comments to the ABC’s Q&A program on Monday night after being asked “What do you think of Noel Pearson’s regret that he did not enter politics some years ago? Would you consider seeking election in the federal parliament?”
Grant replied that the response to a speech he gave last year on Indigenous Australians which went viral, prompted him to think about entering federal politics.
“The response to the speech that I gave, I found so overwhelming and overwhelmingly positive,” Grant said.
“To be honest, it blew me away in the first few days ... the ground sort of shifted beneath my feet. Clearly, there is a responsibility and obligation to the words in that speech.”

In his speech given to the Ethics Centre in Sydney last year, Grant told the audience that racism is “at the heart of the Australian dream”, as he delivered a sobering speech about the impact of colonisation and discrimination on Indigenous people and their ancestors.
While there had been no solid offers to enter federal politics, “it is in my thoughts”, Grant told Q&A.

“[Whether it’s] federal politics or advocacy or staying in the media and continuing to do what I do. This is a great country and my people still suffer in this country.”
It follows comments made by Pearson during an address to the National Press Club last week that he regretted not going into politics 15 years ago, as he felt he had “hit the limit of how much influence you can have barking from the outside”.
Grant’s openness to entering politics generated a positive response on Twitter.

The former England striker replaced Graham Westley in the summer but leaves with them eight points above the relegation zone having picked up only three points from their last eight matches.
“Teddy has had the worst luck I’ve seen in the 16 years I’ve owned the football club,” said the chairman, Phil Wallace, in a statement.
“Normally we’d have one or two major ops on key players in a season but we’ve had more this season than the last three combined.
“You also occasionally lose points in the last few minutes of games but we’ve been in this situation in four of the last eight matches. However, we are where we are and the club have to make a change.
“Teddy came in having to work on a lower budget than we’ve had before and the lack of available funds has made it difficult to get the players he’d like. He’s given it his all but it hasn’t worked and now we have to thank him for his efforts and move on.”
That statement added that the first team coach Darren Sarll will take over as caretaker manager while the club “consider their options”."

The Fifa presidential candidate Gianni Infantino has admitted it is “now or never” to restore credibility to world football’s scandal-hit governing body but refused to criticise the disgraced former leader Sepp Blatter.
Infantino, the Uefa general secretary who entered the race when Michel Platini was forced to withdraw after being banned for eight years, appeared at Wembley to unveil a “90-day plan” to reform Fifa.
“I think it’s now or never. We have to take this opportunity, to take a turn, to make a better Fifa and work for football in a united way, in a positive way. This is the right moment to do that,” said Infantino.
The Swiss-Italian, who has been at Uefa for 15 years, insisted there were no deals in place with other candidates, including the other front runner, the Bahraini Asian Football Confederation president, Sheikh Salman Ebrahim al-Khalifa. “I am a candidate for Fifa president and nothing else. I stand for the presidency until the end,” insisted Infantino.
It had been speculated that an alliance between the pair would ensure Infantino was offered the Fifa general secretary’s job if Sheikh Salman won the presidency. But last week, Sheikh Salman suggested that Infantino’s promises to increase development funds across the board were unrealistic and claimed that Fifa faced the prospect of running out of money within two years if its financial situation did not improve.
Unveiling a raft of big-name supporters including Fabio Capello and José Mourinho, Infantino said he was confident the English FA would back him after meeting the chairman, Greg Dyke, on Monday morning.
Mourinho offered effusive backing for Infantino. “I think he’s very capable, very experienced, with a complete knowledge of everything around football and its organisation,” he said. “I think he’s the one. I am here with a real feeling that I am supporting somebody that can do really well.”

Infantino again defended his use of €500,000 in Uefa funds to pay for his globe-trotting campaign. “It is budgeted for, it is accounted for,” he said.
Challenged over whether Blatter, who was banned for eight years along with Platini in December over a “disloyal payment” between the pair, could become an honorary president in the future, Infantino said he must wait for the outcome of an ongoing appeals process.
“My opinion about Mr Blatter is that, of course, there is a procedure pending there and I don’t want to participate in any speculation about the proceedings. We have to wait until the end of the proceedings before we can judge,” he said.
“What I can say is that Mr Blatter has been for 40 years in Fifa. I respect very much all the work he did in terms of football development in particular around the world. We need to recognise that Fifa has in the last 40 years undergone a great development,” he said.
“Mr Blatter has said himself that he probably should have stepped back a little bit earlier. This is maybe right. We have to wait and see what happens with the proceedings and we will see what the Congress will decide.”
Appeals lodged by Blatter and Platini will be heard by Fifa’s appeals committee later this month, before the presidential election takes place on 26 February. Both have said they will then take their cases to the court of arbitration for sport if their appeals fail.
Infantino unveiled a 10-point plan that he said would begin the process of restoring trust in Fifa in his first 90 days in office.
His pitch was carefully slanted to appeal to Africa and the Caribbean, the regions in which his face-off with Sheikh Salman is likely to be won or lost. He also promised an 11th proposal, which he said would be unveiled with a flourish to voters on 26 February.
Challenged over the way in which Uefa has handled match-fixing scandals in Turkey and Greece, Infantino revealed that he and his family had received death threats and insisted no other body in the world could match its record in tackling the problem.
The other candidates in the race to succeed Blatter are the former Fifa executive committee member Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, the South African Tokyo Sexwale and former Fifa executive Jérôme Champagne."
John Terry|Chelsea|news,2016-02-01T18:39:08,guardian,Dominic Fifield,The Chelsea captain anticipates leaving in the summer because he perceived the Premier League champions intended to consult their new manager before determining whether a further 12-month deal would be forthcoming,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/01/john-terry-chelsea-departure,John Terry confirmed Chelsea departure due to managerial uncertainty,en,football,,"John Terry confirmed he anticipates leaving Chelsea in the summer because he believed the Premier League champions intended to consult their new manager before determining whether a further 12-month deal would be forthcoming.
John Terry to leave Chelsea as one of the club’s toughest and best Read more
The club captain surprised the Chelsea hierarchy by announcing publicly, immediately after Sunday’s 5-1 FA Cup win at MK Dons, that he had been told before the recent victory at Arsenal his stay was not to be extended beyond the summer. “They said that, when the new manager comes in, things might change, but it’s a ‘no’ at the minute,” he said. “I needed to know now, like I have done every January, and sometimes it takes a couple of months to get done. Unfortunately it was a ‘no’. So it’s not going to be a fairytale ending. I’m not going to retire at Chelsea.”
That statement had apparently not been planned and was an impromptu response to a question thrown at him after the cup tie. But the suggestion the club’s hierarchy are keen to discuss Terry’s future with the candidate they appoint on a permanent basis in the summer is understood to have frustrated the 35-year-old, who is free to negotiate a deal with a foreign club for the end of the campaign.
Terry, a veteran of 696 Chelsea appearances, has signed two one-year contract extensions since 2014, in line with the club’s policy of offering 12-month deals to players over 30, with José Mourinho in situ on both occasions to throw his support behind the centre-half. In 2014 the deal was not formalised until May and it was March last year before Chelsea made the announcement the player would be staying on for an 18th senior campaign at the club.
Yet, with no permanent head coach in place this time round, the club were apparently reluctant to pre-empt what their next manager’s attitude would be on Terry, potentially leaving the defender in limbo well beyond the end of the season. The captain could point to the apparent inconsistency in policy given Branislav Ivanovic has recently signed new terms for next season, while the young centre-half Matt Miazga has been recruited from New York Red Bulls this month. Regardless, his dismay appears to have provoked him into going public with his belief his time at Stamford Bridge is drawing to a close.
No concrete offers are believed to be on the table as yet, but he is sure to attract interest from China – where he already has strong links having undertaken a one-man promotional tour last summer – the Gulf and Major League Soccer. Terry has made it clear he will not consider a move to a rival English club, and may even opt not to pursue a move to a European team.
Chelsea’s search for a long-term successor to Mourinho is hampered by the reality the club do not yet know whether they will be able to offer Champions League football. While Diego Simeone at Atlético Madrid would be their preferred candidate, the merits of a number of candidates – including Antonio Conte, Massimiliano Allegri, Mark Hughes and even Eddie Howe and Claudio Ranieri have been discussed.
The club have indicated in a statement, issued late on Sunday night, that they do not consider Terry certain to depart the club in the summer. “John requested a meeting with the club the week before last,” said a spokesman. “In that meeting he asked about the possibility of an extension to his existing contract. John was advised that while no new deal was on the table, that situation could change in the coming months.
“The club has the utmost respect for John and everything he has helped us achieve to date. He is a fantastic servant of Chelsea and a superb captain and, as such, the club will keep the channels of dialogue open.”"
Pep Guardiola|Sportblog|Manchester City|features,2016-02-01T18:54:15,guardian,Jonathan Wilson,Pep Guardiola will bring radical change to the Etihad but the key question is whether he can sustain the intensity of his football over a full English season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/feb/01/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-bayern-munich-barcelona-premier-league,Pep Guardiola must realise Manchester City’s dream of joining the European elite,en,football,,"Bayern Munich’s coach will bring radical change to the Etihad but the key issue is whether he can sustain the intensity of his football over a full English season
For Manchester City, it feels as though the announcement that Pep Guardiola will take charge in the summer is the culmination of a four-year process. From the moment Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano arrived as director of football and chief executive respectively, their aim was to appoint the man with whom they had achieved such success at Barcelona.
While Manchester United flounder in the post-Ferguson, post-Gill world, with a manager – Louis van Gaal – who was the most sought-after in the world 20 years ago and an expensive and largely incomprehensible transfer policy, City can congratulate themselves on their long-term planning. Or at least they can if it works. A four-year battle to get a manager to sign a three-year contract will have been worth it if it establishes City as part of the European elite, whether through consistent success or because of the style of football they play – or, ideally, both. And Guardiola, at the very least, will guarantee interesting football with his radical tactical approach and his meticulous manipulation of his side from the touchline.

But there is something more. In their statement when Robert Mancini was ousted in 2013 – and we now know that there had been talks between the club and Guardiola before that – City spoke of their desire for a “holistic approach”. That remains the goal and that is why so much money has been spent on the academy. In his book Goal – the Ball Doesn’t Go in By Chance, Soriano talks of the importance of a club having an overarching philosophy, something that informs everything it does.
On the most practical footballing level, that means having youth players learning a style of play that is practised by the first team, facilitating their progress through the ranks. It was partly because of his perceived willingness to promote youth (and his rival’s perceived unwillingness) that Guardiola was appointed ahead of José Mourinho to the Barcelona job in 2008. When it works, when a great generation emerges together as happened at Barça, a mutual understanding honed over years means that the level reached is arguably higher than anything that can be achieved by off-the-shelf purchases.
The danger is that the environment becomes so rarefied that outsiders struggle to adapt, something that happened most obviously with Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Barça. Guardiola, though, has shown at Bayern that he is capable of adapting the purist passing style he oversaw at Barça; although he has won less at Bayern he has probably proved himself a more rounded coach there.
It might also be asked quite how a personality as driven and domineering as Guardiola’s fits into Soriano’s holistic vision. His demand for control, something reflected in his touchline persona, has been a major issue at Bayern, with constant spats with various club functionaries, most notably the doctors. City, it is true, is a club with fewer established interests than Bayern but if their planning is as careful and as predicated long-term as it appears, it makes no sense to fall under a cult of personality.

For all City’s fine talk of holism, many of their recent signings have not worked. Eight of the players who started against Napoli in City’s first ever Champions League game in September 2011 are still first-team regulars – and that is despite a net spend of £235m. Raheem Sterling and Kevin De Bruyne have settled rather better than many of their predecessors and probably have a place in the medium-term future but this still seems some way off being a Guardiola squad.
At Barça he had Xavi and at Bayern he has Philipp Lahm, dominant figures blessed with profound football intelligence. There is no obvious equivalent at City nor even a player with the sort of understanding of space demonstrated by David Alaba or Thomas Müller. Sergio Agüero, quick, mobile and deadly, presumably will have a role, as will David Silva with his incisiveness. Vincent Kompany, once his calf heals, will be valuable for his leadership as much as anything else. A better passer alongside him in the heart of the defence may be necessary, though.
Guardiola ended up selling Yaya Touré when he was at Barça and the Ivorian is older and slower now. Touré’s future at City may have been in doubt anyway this summer; with Guardiola’s arrival it seems likely he will leave – particularly after his agent Dimitri Seluk questioned Guardiola’s abilities last month. Fernandinho may just about fit a Guardiola model; Fernando and Fabian Delph probably will not. The centre of midfield looks an obvious place for investment.
The move is important not only for City but also for Guardiola’s legacy. “Maybe I will go to a country where a kitman can be coach and win the title,” Mourinho said after leading Chelsea to the title last season. “Maybe I need to be smarter but I still enjoy these difficulties.” The target of his jibe was fairly obvious: by going to Bayern, a club that had won the treble under Jupp Heynckes in the season before his arrival, Guardiola was taking over a dominant force.
That is not to say that he does not deserve credit for his successes at Bayern, particularly given the sophisticated and thrilling nature of some of the football they have played under him, but equally if Bayern do not win the Champions League this season there would be a sense that his three seasons there had in some way fallen short.
Even if Guardiola does bring the Champions League, the thought will always be that success at Bayern could have been achieved by far lesser managers. Bayern’s dominance – and the latest Deloitte report into football finance shows their revenues for 2014-15 were 69% higher than the next wealthiest German side, Borussia Dortmund – has slightly masked the rebuilding job Guardiola had to do when he succeeded Frank Rijkaard at Barcelona in 2008. Managing City is a far greater examination; there are far fewer guarantees of success. It may be true that, with the backing of Sheikh Mansour, City have greater resources to draw on than any other Premier League club, but in terms of revenue they lag behind United with three other English sides in the top nine.
When Van Gaal described the Premier League as a “rat race”, this is what he meant. This season has suggested that the middle-classes have risen (17 of the 30 sides with the highest revenues in the world in 2014-15 are in the Premier League) and that may make the league even more relentless than before.
The biggest question is whether Guardiola can sustain the intensity of his football over a full English season. That is a concern not only for players asked to press, but also, given his ferocity on the touchline, for Guardiola."

Five facing the exit at Manchester City
Yaya Touré Guardiola has sold him once before – from Barcelona to Manchester City in 2010 – and at 32 he has visibly slowed this season.
Jesús Navas Thinks, runs, plays in straight lines: the polar opposite to the identikit Guardiola footballer.
Aleksandar Kolarov Is suspect defensively and also lacks the prerequisite demanded by Guardiola: a sweet first touch that can turn a game as much as a pass, shot or tackle.
Fernando As Sergio Busquets illustrated, there is room for a destroyer in a Guardiola side but Fernando lacks the craft the Barcelona player also offers.
Wilfried Bony Guardiola seems suspicious of dedicated strikers and one who has so far not been prolific at City appears expendable.

Five who can flourish
Sergio Agüero Has a champion mentality, a world-class technique and cannot stop scoring.
David Silva If Guardiola was to build his perfect creative forward he would surely come up with one close to the 30-year-old.
Kevin De Bruyne Twelve goals and 12 assists for City shows he is built for the Premier League and Champions League and at 24 he will only become better.
Raheem Sterling Has proved he is worth the £49m transfer fee and, given the player’s driven mentality, Guardiola will know he can work with him to try to lift him into the elite class.
Joe Hart The goalkeeper has been near-faultless and may do for Guardiola’s City what Manuel Neuer has done for the Spaniard’s Bayern Munich.
Five they may target
Thiago Alcântara The 24-year-old is the kind of one-touch operator Guardiola looks for, as illustrated when he bought him from Barca in summer 2013.
Marcelo City are desperate to improve their left-back position and the Real Madrid and Brazil defender with Champions League and La Liga titles on his CV would do so.
Paul Pogba City continue to target the powerhouse midfielder and with Guardiola in place it will surely became easier to acquire a man who can dominate contests.
John Stones Guardiola may look at the playmaking Everton centre-back and be reminded of Gerard Piqué, who he signed from Manchester United in 2008 and made one of the supreme defenders.
Philippe Coutinho When fit the Brazilian’s vision and zest allow him to unlock the opposition for Liverpool – a quality usually found in a Guardiola team."

1) Cupcake no more
Time was the January team camps were something of a curio in American soccer – their strategic significance stranded somewhere between the years when the USA squad was a glorified club team, and the present era of tensions between MLS and Jürgen Klinsmann.
The three week camps, and the friendlies that punctuate them, come during the MLS off-season and in the midst of crowded European schedules, so it’s understandable that when you look at the players with one or two international caps to their name, they tend to be MLS journeymen who’ve passed through these January camps, always more likely to feature on the “possible” rather than “probable” list for future rosters. No wonder, perhaps, that these camps once earned the disparaging nickname Camp Cupcake – with their air of “prizes for participation”.
Yet the wave of US internationals who returned to MLS during the last World Cup year has changed the balance and stakes of these camps, and with it the sense of expectation and possibility that comes from them. The majority of the senior core of the team now plays in MLS. Also, the likes of Geoff Cameron, Graham Zusi and Matt Besler and latterly, Gyassi Zardes, have all made breakthroughs at the January camps, and with World Cup qualifying having started, a vital Olympic playoff coming up, as well as the Centenary Copa America this summer, this particular edition of the January camps has had a very particular charge to it.
Add in the underwhelming 2015 performances by the US and Klinsmann, and there’s been a definite imperative for this camp and the performances that come out of it to look more defined than the long noodling experiment of the post-World Cup 2014 period.
USA 3-2 Iceland | International friendly match report Read more
A patchy 3-2 home win over Iceland is hardly a definitive turning of the page, but it’s a start. And while there was the usual January shake up of personnel, surely – surely – even Klinsmann must be moving beyond experimentation for experimentation’s sake. All of the players at this camp should be considered a realistic part of the picture for the 2018 World Cup. That said…
2) Nobody quite seized their chance
It took until the second half against Iceland for any debutants to make an impression – and when they did it was an Iceland player. Aron Sigurdarson was a lively presence and deserved his goal in the 48th minute, when he took advantage of a horrible lack of concentration from US players as they were caught ball-watching on a quickly taken Iceland free-kick.
Before that, various fringe US players had had largely anonymous days, with one or two moments they’ll want to forget. The promising Dallas player Kellyn Acosta may have been deployed out of position as a full-back, but should still have done better with his own bout of ball-watching on the lead-up to Iceland’s opener in the 13th minute, and Ethan Finlay looked serviceable rather than inspiring. Lee Nguyen did nothing particularly bad, without suggesting he’s a long-term threat to Clint Dempsey.
In the second-half though, there were some intriguing cameos. Steven Birnbaum ended up scoring the winner with a well placed header, as well as an assist to help level the scores in the 59th minute. He had his share of blame for some lax defending from the US in the second-half, but his prowess on set pieces at the other end might have done enough to get him more minutes this Friday against Canada.
Most impressive though was the urgency and movement that arrived with the introduction of Jerome Kiesewetter and Jordan Morris for the last 15 minutes of the game. Morris is no secret, and the newly minted Seattle player provided his familiar burst of intelligent movement in the final third – helping pin Iceland back just as they were beginning to cause the US problems. And Kiesewetter’s speed and touch down the right suggested a fearless young player determined to seize his chance. He and Morris are said to enjoy playing together and it showed in their brief time on the field. And with nobody else truly making a compelling case, if Kiesewetter plays this Friday he has the chance to become the breakthrough player from the camp.
3) The biggest center-back intrigue happened off the field
This weekend saw two significant center-back signings for Klinsmann’s 2018 planning. Matt Miazga only got his chance in the New York Red Bulls team last year when an opening day injury to Ronald Zubar gifted him a run in the team. But by the end of 2015 he’d transitioned rapidly through the US national team youth ranks to full international status, and by the last weekend of January 2016 he had signed for Chelsea – and absented himself from the national team camp to do so.
Matt Miazga: Chelsea's pull proves too strong for Red Bulls' standout defender Read more
And at the same time as Miazga was continuing his rapid ascent, John Brooks was signing a new contract with Hertha Berlin. Brooks is a young player who Klinsmann has given plenty of time to come good in the national side – to a degree that critics might call over-indulgence – and consolidating his toehold in German domestic soccer should keep him in his national team coach’s favor.
In the absence of that pair, Michael Orozco and Matt Besler started against Iceland. Besler has been here before – becoming an unlikely starter at the World Cup alongside the talented but erratic Omar Gonzalez. Gonzalez himself was last seen being unveiled as Darth Vader by Pachuca, after finding himself on the outs at LA Galaxy during this off-season. Whether he has the tenacity to win back the golden boy position currently occupied by Miazga is just one of the center-back questions to ponder.
On the field itself, Besler and Orozco didn’t do a lot to suggest they were going to make speculation about absent colleagues an irrelevance, despite Orozco getting a goal. Both were given the full 90 minutes to impress, and both failed, in a shaky US defensive performance. Klinsmann may be closer to his World Cup pairing at the back, but they weren’t playing against Iceland.
4) The midfield pivot is still an issue
It might seem churlish to complain about the midfield pivot in the 4-2-3-1 when said pivot has done what it was intended to do, and facilitated a man of the match performance from Michael Bradley.
So to accentuate the positive first – Bradley had another very good game against European opposition – helping his side to a third successive win over such opposition for the first time in 25 years. Bradley got into dangerous positions to act as playmaker, as well as providing his usual degree of danger from dead balls. Making him tick is always the USA’s best hope of a result against quality opposition, and with Jermaine Jones performing the defensive duties, Bradley was able to play without the burden of responsibility that sometimes sees him spread too thin on the field.
But Jones will not be the starter in that position at the next World Cup, and nor will Kyle Beckerman, who performed a similar limited role at the last World Cup. It’s arguably better to see Jones as a placeholder than it is seeing him be shoehorned into a center-back role, as Klinsmann has previously tried to do. And there’s also a case to be made that after the let downs of last year, Klinsmann needed his most solid midfield platform in place to make sure of any kind of performance against Iceland, particularly with other new moving parts in place in front of them.
But there was something symbolic about watching Perry Kitchen agitating in vain on the sideline to try and make his substitute’s appearance before the final whistle. In fairness Klinsmann had already given Tony Tchani a shot in lieu of Jones for the last 20 minutes, but there’s a real feel of a developmental bottleneck at that position that needs to be resolved sooner rather than later. Klinsmann needs to commit to a long term replacement for Jones, or at least become more serious about who the contenders are. If he was watching at home you could have forgiven Dax McCarty, to name but one, for shaking his head in frustration. He, Tchani or Kitchen might not be the answer, but seeing Jones in this context told us nothing new.
5) We missed a chance to see Darlington Nagbe shine
Darlington Nagbe played for 29 minutes against Iceland, coming on as sub to play out wide. It was a fairly standard cameo appearance under Klinsmann – long enough to potentially do something, anything, but not quite playing the player where he can do what he does best.
Nagbe’s not alone in being set a challenge like that by his international coach, but he’s also one of the few players in the emerging generation of US players who has the potential to be a potent weapon if deployed correctly (ask Caleb Porter what switching Darlington Nagbe to the middle does for your team…).
Of course, the same claim might be made about Nguyen, who played 90 minutes against Iceland as the notional creator in the center, but Nguyen has not reached the heights of his 2014 season with New England of late, and did nothing to suggest he should either replace the aging Dempsey long-term, or remain ahead of Nagbe in the immediate future.
It was clear against Iceland that Nagbe wanted to come inside at every opportunity, and clear that not giving him the freedom to do so meant he never touched his potential. He was muted.
His long wait for citizenship roughly coincided with his club coach finally trusting him to play in the center of the field – a move that ended up being rewarded with Portland Timbers lifting MLS Cup, after a winning run inspired by a liberated Nagbe.
Klinsmann’s yet to make a similar leap of faith. Nagbe’s in the national team picture, but for now, still too close to the edge of it."

“I haven’t decided where I want to go,” De Vanna told AAP. “Am I interested [in playing in America]? Yes and no. My concern is that I’m not 21 and they play on [artificial] turf. I have to think of a club where I’m going to get good football and they care about my body.”
De Vanna’s potential departure is a headache for City coach Joe Montemurro, who has already lost Scottish international Kim Little for next season.
De Vanna is open to staying within the City football family, and spending a season in the English Women’s Super League. But it’s Olympic qualifiers that are occupying her mind. The Matildas saddle up for do-or-die qualifiers in Japan beginning 29 February. Asia’s best six teams play a round-robin tournament, with the top three progressing to Brazil for the Games.
De Vanna, who left open the possibility of walking away from the game, said she will discuss her future with Australian coach Alen Stajcic.
“For me, there is nothing more important than qualifying for a major event like the Olympics,” she said. “It’d be nice to go to Manchester City and stay with an ally. I’m going to talk to Staj and he can tell me what he thinks because my priority is my country.”

De Vanna played a devastating hand in Melbourne City’s 4-1 grand final triumph against Sydney FC on Sunday. She played in Beattie Goad for the team’s third goal and finished the rout with a tearaway run and goal in injury time.
Perhaps surprisingly, she said the side’s grand final win wasn’t their finest accomplishment. “We talk about grand finals and winning it, of course that’s big,” she said. “The biggest thing is that we went through the season undefeated. The grand final was the icing on the cake. To finally be W-League champions is a great feeling.”"
A-League|Sydney FC|Australia sport|news,2016-02-01T02:22:18,guardian,Australian Associated Press,"Norwegian giants Rosenborg are set to sign talented Sydney FC youngster Alex Gersbach on a three-and-a-half-year contract, pending a medical",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/01/sydney-fc-youngster-alex-gersbach-to-undergo-medical-at-rosenborg,Sydney FC youngster Alex Gersbach to undergo medical at Rosenborg,en,football,,"Norwegian club Rosenborg are set to sign talented Sydney FC youngster Alex Gersbach on a three-and-a-half-year contract, pending a medical. A post on Rosenborg’s website said the club have been keeping tabs on the in-demand 18-year-old left-back, who flies out of Australia on Monday.
Sydney reluctantly released Gersbach on the weekend following Saturday night’s 3-1 home loss to Brisbane and the departure of one of Graham Arnold’s best players this season is a big blow to the Sky Blues’ title aspirations.

But they will at least benefit financially by selling the Olyroo before his contract expires at the end of the season. Sydney are understood to have picked up a decent transfer fee plus a sell-on clause should he ever move to a larger European club, which has always been Gersbach’s ambition.
Norway’s Tippeligaen, the country’s top-tier league, will likely provide an ideal stepping stone so long as the Sutherland Shire product continues to develop and get game time.
Rosenborg are Norway’s most successful outfit with 23 league titles, including 13 consecutive between 1992 and 2004. Last October they won their first championship in five years, and are also regulars in the Uefa Champions League group stage.
Sydney are unlikely to rush into signing a replacement full-back before the January transfer window closes on Tuesday. Rhyan Grant has occasionally filled in at left-back, while Ali Abbas has returned from injury and the untried Riley Woodcock shapes as another option.
Sought-after Newcastle utility David Carney can also play there. A swap deal to secure Carney has been in the works for more than a week, with speculation only escalating when the former Socceroo was left out of the Jets’ squad to face Adelaide on Sunday. But it is understood the Sydney player or players at the centre of talks have so far not been persuaded to head north."

FA Cup|Ten talking points from this weekend's action|West Bromwich Albion|Peterborough|Arsenal|Burnley|Colchester|blogposts,2016-02-01T08:35:47,guardian,Guardian Sport,"John Terry’s dramatic revelation about his Chelsea career may not be the final word, Rémi Garde was probably right to focus on the league and Wayne Rooney continues to draw inspiration from Bobby Charlton",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/feb/01/fa-cup-talking-points-weekend-action,FA Cup: talking points from the fourth round,en,football,,"1) Terry’s dramatic revelation may not be the final word
There was a whiff of political manoeuvring to John Terry’s post-match announcement that Chelsea had opted against offering him new terms for the summer. It was the way in which the captain laboured his point, while also suggesting the hierarchy had “said that, when the new manager comes in, things might change but it’s a ‘no’ at the minute.”. There, unmistakeably, was his get-out should this tale take another twist. At present, anything feels possible. Maybe an offer is on the table, most likely from the Chinese Super League who appear so intent upon plundering the Premier League this winter, which Terry hopes Chelsea will come close to matching. Perhaps, now he has entered the final six months of his contract at Stamford Bridge and is permitted to negotiate a summer Bosman move to a foreign club, this is all a lavish game to coax a reaction from the club where he has spent the last 18 years as a professional. Certainly the timing felt rather odd. That Chelsea were compelled to issue their own statement late on Sunday night suggested they too had been taken by surprise by the centre-back’s outburst, with damage limitation underway given the reception that might await at Watford on Wednesday night. By the end of Sunday that instinctive reading of Terry’s comments – all anguished regret and resignation that his time at this club is drawing to a close – did not seem quite so clear-cut. Doubt is already creeping in – a parting of the ways may not be inevitable – fuelled by hints a new manager might want a say on whether a player with 700 career club games to his name should be discarded. The key now is the speed with which either party makes their next move: does Terry sign elsewhere, do the club stick or twist? Dominic Fifield

2) Arsenal’s repeat against Hull City equals relief
Arsène Wenger had simply offered up a prayer with regard to the FA Cup draw in the immediate aftermath of Saturday’s 2-1 home win over Burnley. The Arsenal manager was well aware that after the fifth-round weekend his team play Barcelona on Tuesday, 23 February, in the Champions League last 16, first leg. His prayers were answered when his club pulled the Championship leaders, Hull City, at home. It will be the third season in succession Arsenal have faced Hull and they have won each of the previous meetings – most famously, the 2014 final, which was an extra-time thriller. It did, though, raise the general question about Arsenal’s ability to fight on three fronts and Wenger, who is now without only three players – Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshere and Santi Cazorla – was bullish. “If we can keep everybody fit, we can do it,” he said. “Against Burnley, I rested Monreal, Bellerin, Ramsey, Walcott, Özil, Mertesacker of course [who was suspended]. Barcelona will play as well on the weekend before the tie.” David Hytner

3) Garde was probably right to focus on the league
Many would say Aston Villa are down already and watching their listless display against Manchester City students of body language would find it hard to disagree. Yet Rémi Garde admitted afterwards he had made a few changes with the next couple of league games in mind, and looking at the fixture list it is not difficult to see why. Villa’s fate could be determined this week. They have a home game against West Ham on Tuesday and a visit to Norwich at the weekend. They need to win both. If they do they can at least stay in touch with the other relegation candidates; if they don’t their crisis of confidence will continue into a difficult run of opponents that include Liverpool, Everton, Stoke, Manchester City and Tottenham. So, Villans, no pressure or anything but this is the week to get going. Points from anywhere else are likely to arrive too late. Paul Wilson
4) Liverpool’s armband rotation allows Klopp to show faith
Liverpool’s goalless draw against West Ham was notable only for young players overshadowing more experienced team-mates, Darren Randolph’s commanding display in the visitors’ goal and more complaints from Jürgen Klopp about replays and the fixture list. It did, however, provide another example of the Liverpool manager’s belief that responsibility should be accepted throughout the squad as Joe Allen became the seventh player to captain the side during Klopp’s 26 matches in charge. Brendan Rodgers frequently bemoaned an absence of leadership in his team, often justifiably so, but – as with his trust in young players to handle Premier League opposition at home in the FA Cup – Klopp has given his players an opportunity to address that concern. For Allen, who is out of contract at the end of next season, the armband was a timely show of faith from his manager. In answer to the inevitable question Klopp’s other Liverpool captains have been Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Lucas Leiva, Kolo Touré, Christian Benteke and José Enrique. Andy Hunter
5) Iturbe can learn from Howe history lesson
Juan Iturbe’s move from Roma to Bournemouth on loan was one of the more eye-catching deals of the transfer window. A £16m purchase from Verona in June 2014 the 22-year-old, who has played one friendly for Paraguay but has since declared his allegiance to his homeland Argentina, made a promising start in the Italian capital but quickly drifted to the fringes. Iturbe showed glimpses of his quality amidst the huff and puff of the victory against Portsmouth, particularly with a powerful shot that Ryan Fulton did brilliantly to tip on to the post in the first half, but his manager knows there is potentially plenty more to come. “The first half wasn’t something he was maybe used to. Juan’s talent is not in doubt, he’s an outstanding player. I still feel there’s an adjustment from our perspective to get the best out of him.” That’s not all Howe will do to make him feel at home. Bournemouth’s captain, Tommy Elphick, revealed new signings are given a club history lesson by the manager when they join. Since Howe has spent almost half of his life at the club, Iturbe would do well to listen. Ed Aarons
6) Colchester’s excellent youth system poses questions
If, as seems increasingly likely, Colchester United are a League Two side next season they stand to be the only club in the bottom tier with a Category Two academy. The club have invested sizeable sums in their youth operation, largely at the expense of their first-team budget, and the results are obvious both in a visit to their training ground and a look at the squad that faced Tottenham Hotspur. Alex Gilbey, an imposing central midfielder who looks cut out for a move higher up the leagues, caught the eye in particular and it is heartening to see another lower-division club follow the development model that Crewe Alexandra continue to embrace so wholeheartedly. It is getting harder and harder: a Category Two operation costs little short of seven figures annually – that is a commitment beyond most below the Championship and some in it. It is easy to understand the concerns many clubs share that, for all the rhetoric about benefiting the English game, the Elite Player Performance Plan has turned out to be little more than a carve-up designed to garland a select few. Colchester are exceptional at what they do and the hope is that they will reap the rewards further down the line; they seem a more logical starting point for a young player than many of the serial hoarders further up the chain and it is just a shame that the system makes it so difficult for other clubs of their standing, many of which have impressive histories of youth development, to work similarly. Nick Ames
7) Proximity of goals’ target can help Rooney and United
Manchester United have developed a habit of pulling out a result or two whenever a full-blown crisis appears to be developing and that was certainly the thought after what turned into a comfortable win over Derby. United were good value for the win and it cannot go unnoticed that Wayne Rooney, whose excellent first-half goal was his sixth in as many games, seems to be growing in confidence by the week. Rooney, now six goals short of Bobby Charlton’s club record, has scored 13 goals in a difficult campaign. United have, away from home at least, shown a few signs of packing a greater punch this month and a revitalised Rooney can only bring out the best in team-mates such as Anthony Martial and Juan Mata, both of whom put in encouraging performances at the iPro Stadium. There are greater tests to come but perhaps the proximity of bettering Charlton’s tally will – consciously or not – give Rooney that extra impetus to pull United round. Nick Ames

8) Can Suárez live up to his namesake’s reputation?
Completion of the signing of Mario Suárez, following that of Nordin Amrabat and Costel Pantilimon, means Watford’s supporters can be quietly pleased with the business done during the January transfer window. If rumours are to be believed they missed out on Andros Townsend but the £12m paid by Newcastle for the former Spurs winger represents questionable value, certainly in comparison to the total of £10m paid for Amrabat and Suárez. According to Watford’s manager, Quique Sánchez Flores, Suárez turned down an offer from Valencia to sign a four-and-a-half-year deal at Vicarage Road, and it seems clear their relationship dating from a year together at Atlético Madrid was a key factor. Flores described Suárez as a “pivot” and if he can, as he put it, “recuperate” the player, the midfielder will join the likes of his namesake Luis as one of those January signings who prove outstanding business can be done in mid-season. Richard Rae
9) Pitch quality is no longer the great leveller
Graham Westley has an interesting theory about why there are fewer victories for underdogs compared to previous eras: the lack of bad pitches. “One of the things that has changed from years gone by is pitches are no longer the levelling aspect,” he said after Peterborough’s 2-2 draw at West Brom. “Pitches at all levels are better and therefore quality gets more time to shine. When Wrexham beat Arsenal [in 1992], you look at the pitch that day and it made it difficult for highly technical players to get a result. Technical players have a chance to shine wherever and perhaps that’s a factor. Top-level players are top-level players for a reason. Lower-level players are lower-level players for a reason.” Westley was keen to stress his team are no ordinary bunch of lower-league players, though. “The only difference with us is that we have young players who are recruited because they are the best young players in the lower leagues and go on to higher levels. Our players cannot be underestimated” Alan Smith

10) Oxford deserve every success in attempts to provide closure
Named after the former club chairman Firoz Kassam, who still owns it, there is something slightly odd about the Kassam Stadium, home of Oxford United since they moved from the Manor Ground in 2001. Odd in the fact that it is home to as impressive a statue of a muscular bronze ox as you’re ever likely to see, but nobody appears to have noticed that they’re missing a fourth stand. The upshot? Well, quite apart from the fact that it leaves the windscreens of cars parked too near one end susceptible to damage from wayward shots, the absence of that all-important “fourth wall”, while to be encouraged in theatre circles, just makes an otherwise fine stadium look downright unfinished and a little bit weird. In a match that generated few talking points, let’s not pretend this is one of extreme urgency, but under Michael Appleton Oxford appear to be a team that is going places. Should they ascend to the Championship in the next few seasons, as is his stated intention, here’s hoping they can buy the stadium from its current owner, overcome any legal difficulties involving the local council and achieve closure in every sense of the word. Barry Glendenning
11) One incident should not obscure a special occasion
League Two Carlisle United’s 3-0 fourth round defeat to Everton should be remembered for the indomitable effort of those Cumbrians who somehow, and against all odds, enabled the club to get this game on in the wake of the devastation inflicted on Brunton Park and the surrounding area by December’s floods. Then there was a wonderful performance from Everton’s Ross Barkley and the beautiful, elegant, simplicity of Roberto Martínez’s team’s football. Most of the headlines concentrated on an isolated incident of alleged racist abuse directed towards Arouna Koné and Steven Pienaar after Koné scored the opening goal. It is right there should be zero tolerance towards such behaviour and Carlisle dealt with the matter very well, issuing a public address announcement stressing this was not on. It should not be allowed to obscure the generally generous spirited atmosphere of the home crowd who offered Barkley a splendid standing ovation when he was substituted. As Martínez put it: “Carlisle United deserve incredible credit for getting the game on. They’ve given us all a lesson of how to face adversity in life and football.”"
MLS|Sportblog|China|US sports|features,2016-02-01T09:00:24,guardian,John Duerden,Attendances and broadcast deals are rising in China as the government looks to build its homegrown talent too,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/feb/01/why-china-not-mls-is-luring-stars-away-from-europe,"Why China, not MLS, is luring stars away from Europe",en,football,,"When a little known club just promoted to the top tier of Chinese football is buying a regular starter from a club placed fifth in Serie A then you know that times are changing. But Gervinho aside there is a hitherto unremarkable mid-table club chasing Zlatan Ibrahimovic and paying Chelsea over $30m for Ramires and a second division team paying $11m for a young Chinese player. China is set to become the biggest non-European league in the world in the not-too-distant future, overtaking the likes of MLS, Mexico and any other you may care to mention.
The really big names that can be tempted to leave Europe often go to MLS – Beckham, Lampard, Henry, Gerrard, Kaka and Pirlo – but China is increasingly able to pay big money (often too big at the moment but that is due to necessity more than naivety) for players that are not quite so stellar but are usually much closer to their prime. Guangzhou have Ricardo Goulart, still only 24 and regarded as one of the top Brazilian prospects a year ago when he left Cruzerio, while Beijing Guoan has Renato Augusto one of four players from Brazilian champions Corinthians to make a recent move to China. East Asia is still a relative culture shock for players based in South America or Europe than North America but a growing number of Chinese clubs can offer huge salaries with Renato Augusto more than quadrupling his. The US transfer system can be complex with plenty of rules and regulations. In China, it’s naked capitalism. There’s lots of money and lots of people happy to see that cash buying players from overseas.
Jackson Martínez completes Guangzhou Evergrande move from Atlético Madrid Read more
In terms of attendances, MLS and China are similar but perhaps not for long. The 2016 Super League season, set to kick off in March, is the most eagerly-awaited yet. Last year saw an average attendance of just over 22,000, less than two hundred behind Italy and France. A high-ranking league official told the Guardian that this season will see the 25,000 barrier broken and predicts that by 2018, the Chinese Super League will be the third most-watched football league in terms of average attendance in the world behind the Bundesliga and the English Premier League. There’s money, the political will, the infrastructure, the passion, the ambition and plenty of potential. Talk in Europe of whether the spending is sustainable is misguided. This is just one of many examples of the world’s second largest economy flexing its financial muscles.
It is already having an effect at home. In 2015 Chinese broadcasters paid just $9m to show local league games. In 2016 it will be over $200m as part of a $1.25bn package over the next five seasons.
Guangzhou Evergrande has become the prime mover in China after being taken over by a huge property developer. Five Chinese titles, two Asian Champions Leagues and two World Cup winning coaches later, the Cantonese giant wants to win the Fifa Club World Cup. With Robinho, Paulinho, Goulart, Luiz Felipe Scolari, much of the Chinese national team and an average attendance of over 45,000, it is already Asia’s premier club.
Shanghai SIPG was runner-up in 2015 but Sven Goran Eriksson lost out once again to Scolari. The Swede has been spending big, paying around $50m for Ghanaian goal-king Asamoah Gyan and Brazilian striker Elkeson. The club still wants Robin van Persie or Wayne Rooney. Shanghai Shenhua has Demba Ba, Fredy Guarin and Tim Cahill. Beijing Guoan risks getting left behind but still had 42,000 applications for 27,000 season tickets earlier this month.
Beijing has Serie A winning coach Alberto Zaccheroni in the hotseat and, as well as Scolari and Sven at Evergrande and SIPG, there’s ex-Brazil boss Mano Menezes at Shandong Luneng and Dragan Stojkovic, not long ago tipped to be Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal successor, with Guangzhou R&F. Whatever the past failings of the Chinese system, the country’s best players are increasingly being coached by well-regarded international names.
The spending has been encouraged by a government headed by big soccer fan Xi Jinping. The president was tired of the world’s most populous country continually failing at the world’s most popular game. Wealthy businessmen get involved, in part, to curry favor and craft links with the politicians and even perhaps, to make money. Guangzhou may have spent over $150m on players and coaches since 2010 but Evergrande, who bought the club for $16m, sold 50% of it for $190m to internet giant Alibaba – just four years later.
There is still, of course, much work to be done to improve the standard of local players. As well as in terms of men’s national teams, China lags behind the United States in a big way when it comes to participation. Soccer may be the most played sport among American youth but kids rarely play the game in the Middle Kingdom often due to a lack of places to play or the preference of parents to have their (usually only) offspring aim for a “real” job rather than professional football.
The government has launched a scheme to get kids playing football at school and the target in 2017 is to have 20,000 schools playing the sport on a weekly basis. This is set to be expanded in a big way. Guangzhou has built what is purported to be the biggest soccer academy in the world (helped by Real Madrid) and the fact that there is more money coming into the game – such as from the new television deal and increasing corporate interest – should feed through to local players further down the chain, making professional football an increasingly attractive option a decade from now. By that time, the league should be thriving.
Producing more local talent would mean that the league would be less reliant on foreign stars, though the money is likely to be there regardless of any wider economic problems. It is debatable as to which league is the best outside Europe but whichever it is, China is catching fast. That may not matter much to fans in North America but is another sign that the balance of power is moving east along with Gervinho, Ramires and who knows who else?"

Hello Saido Berahino! Yes, the West Brom striker is still haunting the Hawthorns. But, hopefully, for the good of Berahino, Tony Pulis and idle gossip-mongers, not for too much longer. You see, Newcastle and Stoke are keen to throw far too much money at Jeremy Peace for the player. Steve McClaren has already lobbed in a bid of £21m but the Baggies want £25m for a red-hot forward who has scored three league goals this season and about whom Pulis has said: “Saido has to realise he is a footballer … he has wasted three or four months. I’m not picking him because he’s not been anywhere near what he was last year.” Despite this glowing review, Mauricio Pochettino, may still swing around into Berahino’s view, arms out wide like a forgiving dad, and allow the striker to cry on his broad shoulders before becoming the new Hélder Postiga Jermain Defoe at Tottenham Hotspur.
Transfer deadline day – live! Read more
For some reason or other Leicester City are prepared to throw £7m the way of Crystal Palace for a striker who can’t get into a team that can’t score any goals and who has just dropped down the pecking order behind the footballer formerly known as Emmanuel Adebayor. Yes, Dwight Gayle, an energetic, pesky but woefully underused striker, has got Claudio Ranieri’s lips quivering. We’re not quite sure how, mind, as he hasn’t played for the past two months but that what it says here. Loïc Rémy is also on Ranieri’s radar. Guus Hiddink can’t find anything for him to do at Chelsea so he’ll happily see him out of the Stamford Bridge exit door. But Watford, being a shorter journey for a player who never likes to bust a gut to get anywhere, may be his preferred choice and £11.5m would be a very welcome addition in the Bank of Chelsea.
Liverpool aren’t prepared to be taken to the cleaners by Shakhtar Donetsk to secure the services of Alex Teixeira. They’ve been told that the forward’s buyout clause is not £38m – and perhaps after Shahktar suits plucked the next figure from the wings of a fairy that was hovering by at the time – been quoted £53.2m. Hmmm. So, what about a deal for Real Madrid’s Denis Cheryshev then? Remember him? Yes, the cup curse himself. The left winger could sign just in time to tumble out of the FA Cup replay at West Ham. Zinedine Zidane is loading him into a cannon in anticipation of firing him out of the Bernabéu as we speak. “Cheryshev could leave. He’s a great player but he needs to be playing regularly. The most important thing for him is that he gets minutes. He is a hard-working player and he needs to be building up playing time. I wish him the best. If he has the chance to leave, I’d be delighted for him.” Jürgen Klopp will have to tussle with Sevilla for the 25-year-old though. They also have the hots for him.
Despite regularly dribbling out of defence like he’s being controlled by a 12-year-old playing Fifa 16, John Stones is still going up in value like a three-bedroom house in north London. Apparently, Manchester City and Chelsea are willing to part with £50m for the frisky centre-back, but expect any deal to take place in the summer, not in the next few minutes. Chelsea, for some reason or other, think he can replace the outgoing John Terry. As for City, well, if Pep turns up, he’ll probably invent a new position for Stones in which defending isn’t that important so perhaps that makes more sense. And while we’re on the subject of Terry, New York City, LA Galaxy, Montreal Impact, Guangzhou Evergrande and Fenerbahce would quite like to snaffle the Brave One when he is allowed to leave Chelsea in the summer.

Having failed with his bid to add to Michu’s painful journey over the past few years by bringing him to the Aston Villa pleasure dome, Rémi Garde will instead make the leftfield move of targeting a full-back, Mathieu Debuchy. Arsenal’s forgotten man could make an initial loan move before escaping in the summer so that his career doesn’t get tainted by playing in the Championship. Seydou Doumbia won’t be going on loan to Aston Villa. The Roma striker would much rather join a relegation fight he has a chance of winning at Newcastle.
Roberto Martínez will attempt to bring Dynamo Kyiv attacking midfielder Andriy Yarmolenko and Locomotiv Moscow striker Oumar Niasse to Goodison Park. That will help to stop those second-half collapses then.

Arsène Wenger believes John Terry will move into coaching once his playing career ends, describing the Chelsea defender as a leader and a “great coach on the pitch”.
Terry is set to leave Chelsea at the end of the season, having joined the club at 14 and played almost 700 games for the Premier League champions. Arsenal have not beaten Chelsea in a league match since 2011 and Terry’s defence have not conceded a goal against them in the last six.
There remains some doubt whether Terry will be offered a new contract before his existing deal expires in the summer, with the player saying “the club’s moving in a different direction”. Wenger ruled out a move for the 35-year-old but said he had been a symbol of Chelsea’s strength in recent years.
“He was not only a great player, he certainly still is, but he was also a great coach on the pitch,” said Wenger. “I saw him here once at London Colney playing with the Under-21s and the way he coached the team as a player was absolutely marvellous. He was a real leader and he had a great career as well, let’s not forget that.
“That’s never a coincidence. The guys who last such a long time have something special. He was the symbol of cohesion inside Chelsea’s club because him, [Frank] Lampard, [Didier] Drogba and [Petr] Cech were the players who carried the club’s values for long periods. When you lose players like that you’re always in danger. I see a coaching career in his future, certainly. He will remain in football, I’m sure.”
“The problem of our job and for the players is that it [careers in football] stops very early in your life. You lose that passion very early in your life and you know how to refocus something and be as good as anything is nearly impossible. That is not easy to deal with. I’m confronted with many generations of players who after their career have that problem.”
Asked if he would consider a deal for Terry if he leaves Chelsea, Wenger added: “No, because he is at the end of his career and he has spent his career at Chelsea. If he wants to play longer, I am sure he will play for Chelsea.”
Arsenal host Southampton on Tuesday, a little over a month after they were beaten by Ronald Koeman’s side 4-0. Tomas Rosicky will miss the game with a thigh problem but Wenger will have key players available after resting Mesut Özil and Theo Walcott for the FA Cup victory over Burnley.
Wenger does not expect Arsenal to make any moves in the transfer window today, although he said there remains a slim possibility that the full-back Mathieu Debuchy could leave on loan, with Serge Gnabry set to join a Championship club on loan.
“Debuchy [leaving] is a possibility. At the moment it doesn’t look likely but it is still a possibility,” said Wenger. “The whole period was much quieter that I expected. I thought there would be much more activity.
“A miracle can always happen, someone can knock on your door and if Messi knocks on my door at 6pm tonight, I will not say ‘please go back to Barcelona!’”"

Luis Enrique shot up in the air and leapt about, waving his arms around, shouting: “What is this? What is this?” In front of him, a crowd gathered. Lionel Messi lay on the floor, Alberto Undiano Mallenco took a red card from his pocket and raised it. Filipe Luís lifted his hands to his head, conscious of what he had just done, the price paid for a horrible tackle. It was just before half-time in the match that had been declared “half the league title”, 94,990 people were watching and Atlético Madrid were 2-1 down to Barcelona at the Camp Nou. Now, they were a man down as well, the defender heading to the press room, where he watched the rest of the game. As for Messi, he was OK. What is this? The End.
It was supposed to be, anyway – but it wasn’t, not yet. Asked about Filipe Luís’s challenge – studs up, straight on to Messi’s knee – Luis Enrique admitted he’d been “scared”. He wasn’t the only one and that wasn’t the only time. The worry never entirely went away, concern gripping in the last minute as the goalkeeper Jan Oblak went up for a free-kick. When the referee blew a moment later, a 2-1 victory finally secured, there was relief for Barcelona. Diego Simeone stood on the touchline waiting to congratulate all of his players. They were two short but still Barça had suffered. “They were scared against nine men,” insisted the Atlético striker Yannick Carrasco.

“In football you can win, draw or lose. If we have to lose, I would like it to always be like that,” Simeone said. He called his team “amazing”. It took only nine minutes for them to open the scoring, after Saúl had rolled Jordi Alba from a throw-in to find Koke running in. Perhaps more significantly, it took less than two minutes for them to have their first shot, Claudio Bravo diving to push away Saúl’s curler, and more than two and a half minutes for the ball to even enter their half. A pattern had been set. Barcelona could not find a way out, pushed so deep that the passes – when they were completed at all – almost went sideways along the byline and back again.
The buses have been reversed off the goal-line, peep-peeping. Barcelona have been confronted by a different tactical problem lately. Like Málaga and Athletic Bilbao before them, Atlético decided not to wait but to seek Barcelona out, closing off the avenues from the back. Carrasco joined Antoine Griezmann, targeting players and chasing them down while behind those two the rest of Atlético’s players moved up in formation. It is not really what Atlético do but they had been preparing this all week.
“With 4-3-3 you can’t really do it but 4-4-2 allows you to,” Simeone explained. “We wanted to annoy Busquets and force Piqué and Mascherano to be the ones with the ball, then be aggressive in winning it. It’s not easy to do but with Carrasco loose [closing them], we did. For 26 minutes we had speed, play and pushed them back.”
Barcelona did not know where to begin; the team that prefers to build was denied its foundations. Messi came back deeper to take responsibility and he, too, was pressed; twice in two minutes he gave the ball away. Luis Enrique called the start “strange”. Then on 30 minutes Messi scored the equaliser and eight minutes after that Luis Suárez made it 2-1, his goal a mix of the one that won last season’s clásico and the one that put Barcelona 1-0 up at Mestalla before Christmas. Next, Filipe Luís took out Messi, earning the first of two red cards about which no one could complain – not that it stopped some in the media, of course.
Now, if 4-4-2 allows you to pressure, 4-4-1 should not but The End did not come with Filipe Luís’s red card; it did not come with Diego Godín’s red card in the 66th minute, either; and it did not even come when Augusto Fernández was wheeled off the pitch 10 minutes after that, kissed on his way by his countryman Javier Mascherano.
After 55 minutes, with the score at 2-1 and Atlético down to 10 men, the best chance of the game fell to Griezmann six yards out – only for Claudio Bravo to somehow save his header with his feet. Atlético had begun the second half like they had begun the first, despite the man disadvantage. Even when Godín was sent off for a wild and unnecessary challenge on Suárez, taking Atlético down to nine, not so much shooting themselves in the foot as blowing it to bits with a blunderbuss, Barcelona did not end it – and not only because they were wasting countless chances, either. They weren’t: both teams had four shots on target, the total reading 10-7. When Oblak took off up the pitch, a draw was plausible.

“I’m proud of what we did, even with eight [outfield] players,” Simeone said. “Even with eight players, we caused them problems right to the end.” Asked if he had anything to reproach his players for – after all, it was natural to ask what might have happened with 11 men – he shot back: “No. Absolutely nothing.” Saúl added: “I am proud of my team; we leave here with our heads held high.”
Marca insisted: “Atlético died with their boots on” and called it an “exhibition of self-esteem, intensity and football”. AS’s front cover ran on: “Atlético deserved more.” El País lead on: “Atletico play, Barcelona win.” Its match report opened with the line: “Even though Barcelona won, people will talk about Atlético”. They did, too, and rightly so.
Where there was talk about Barcelona, meanwhile, it focused mostly on what they did wrong. Marca called them “passive” and “unrecognisable”, while Mascherano admitted they did not play well. They have played every three days since returning after the Club World Cup and that will continue into March. They look fatigued – or as if they are conserving energy aware that fatigue may follow – and Marca was wrong to call them “unrecognisable”: some flaws were familiar.
Yet, there was no escaping that first line: Barcelona won. It did not end when many thought, they had suffered more than most expected but when the final whistle went they had won. Just as they had won their last two games against Málaga and Athletic. Just as they have now won eight in a row and have gone 26 games without defeat, leaving them two games off the record set by Pep Guardiola’s team. Tiredness may have taken them but, in terms of results, this is their best January since the six-trophy season in 2009.
There were other elements, too, more positive ones. When they were under pressure, Gerard Piqué was superb again, holding them together: too often his value to his team goes unrecognised. If others lost the ball, he did not. Messi dropping deeper spoke of responsibility and there were four tackles as well, while he also scored the equaliser when he somehow found space in an area populated by nine opponents. Suárez scored his 30th goal in 31 games and is the league’s top scorer. Dani Alves produced his 99th La Liga assist. He made the second; Alba made the first. Both goals were brilliant, both were made in very different ways.
Luis Enrique praised his team’s “capacity to suffer and come through it”. Put under pressure, Barcelona still sought to play but they are a team who can release quicker and longer, too, as Alves’s wonderful pass for Suárez’s second showed. Even if it was brief, even if the failure to kill off the game will cause concern, when they reacted in the first half they did play very well: the speed and precision of the passing was impressive. For all the talk of the red cards, they turned it around against 11 men – not 10 or nine – and not just any men either: Simeone’s men.
Twenty-two weeks into the league season, Atlético have let in more than a solitary goal in only two La Liga games: both of them against Barcelona. Luis Enrique’s side have now scored 44.44% of the goals that Atlético have conceded all year.
“Sometimes it seems like when you don’t win 4-0, it’s dreadful, when nothing could be further from the truth,” Luis Enrique insisted. “This is football and they’re not machines. This is a very, very good result against a very good team.” With just under half the season remaining, it is far from conclusive but it is significant. It did not end with the red card but it did end with a Barcelona victory. They had just won a game that was, as the headlines had it, “half a league”. Small wonder Sport cheered: “Barcelona smell like champions.”
It hadn’t been easy but Barcelona won again, climbing three points and head-to-head goal difference above Atlético, four points and head-to-head above Madrid, and with a game in hand. “The league’s not over,” Luis Enrique said. “The league’s not over,” Zinedine Zidane said. “There’s a long way to go.”
Simeone agreed: “But this lot don’t slip up often.”
Talking points

• Oh, Álvaro. Valencia had not lost a league game at Mestalla in more than a year. They have now. This weekend, they were beaten 1-0 by Sporting Gijón.
They have now gone 11 league games without a win – the longest winless run in the division – and Gary Neville is yet to win in the league, although his side are in the Copa del Rey semi-final against Barcelona this week. “I’m looking forward to that,” he said. “Yeah, so are Barcelona,” remarked AS’s Juanma Trueba.
“You ask how I explain that game,” Neville said after the defeat. “I find it difficult, sat there with some of the players and the coaching staff, for15 minutes trying to understand what has actually happened out there. It’s the most disappointing result of the season but that does not tell the story of the game. This is not a game we should have lost.” It’s not, no, but they did. Álvaro Negredo is still a baffling striker at times, sometimes brilliant, sometimes … well, not. He missed three great chances and hit the post. “I can’t explain it. This was a game to have won four or five-one,” Neville said, rightly.
Asked about his position, Neville replied: “I find that question ridiculous.”
• “Come on presidente, let us play: we’re not Maradona.” So said Espanyol’s Burgui in the buildup to his team’s visit to the Bernabéu to face Real Madrid – the club that he and Marco Asensio belong to. Madrid had imposed another of those crapping-yourself clauses that for some reason the league allows, even though they adulterate the competition, so Espanyol were without six starters, two of them loanees from Madrid. Even if they had played – and had been Maradona – it might not have prevented what felt like the inevitable walloping. Can we play you every week? Three up after quarter of an hour, for the second time this season Madrid put six past Espanyol. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick to take him level with Luis Suárez at the top of the Pichichi chart, the second of them superb. He has 19 goals in the league, 42.1% of them against Espanyol.

• Kévin Gameiro wasn’t hanging around. He scored after 52 seconds and with a single touch as Sevilla defeated Levante 3-1 – for whom Giuseppe Rossi scored on his return to Spain. That’s 12 goals so far this season, all finished off first-time, one touch.
• Hold on to your sides. David Barral is back, having joined Granada. Asked what he had learned during his brief spell in the Middle East, he replied: “To value Spain.”
• “It’s fashionable to talk about the footballers’ code these days, [so] a few things: 1) The first code is that what happens on the pitch stays on the pitch and I won’t be break that rule, I won’t reveal everything that Gurpegui and Aduriz said to me. It’s so ugly that I won’t repeat it. There are limits that should not be crossed!!
2) As a colleague, a fellow professional and for the good of football, you cannot spend 90 minutes provoking [people] constantly, running up close to them. Just because someone puts a hand on your chest [you can’t] pretend you have been attacked, Aduriz, to try to get someone sent off. That’s part of the footballer’s code, too; that football as wiped out years ago but, of course, here in Spain they call it being smart.
3) Football is a contact sport. Today you can say that Aduriz won the other football and he was clever in faking … all this is sad!!
Finally, it’s good to be polite: congratulations to Athletic Bilbao for the three points and, yes, Aduriz is a great player, even if he didn’t score today!!
PS. I don’t talk about the referees, they all do things right and wrong, just like us.
Respect Getafe.”
Anyone else think Getafe’s Cala wasn’t impressed with Athletic Bilbao? And, watching the game, anyone else think that Athletic might not be that impressed with Cala?

Pep Guardiola will have at least £150m to spend on players when he replaces Manuel Pellegrini as the Manchester City manager in the summer. The Spaniard’s salary will also rise to €20m (£15.2m) after it was confirmed he will move to the Etihad following the expiry of his contract with Bayern Munich.
City’s standing as the richest club in the world along with next season’s record Premier League broadcast deal of £5.14bn means Guardiola will be given the backing to enter the market as he wishes in the close season. The club’s finances will be further swelled by the new overseas broadcast deal, expected to be a minimum of €3bn.

He is a close friend of City’s director of football, Txiki Begiristain, and is expected to consult him regarding transfers before taking over on 1 July.
Guardiola earns €17m at Bayern Munich but this is to increase by €3m in recognition of his standing as one of the world’s most sought after managers. City believed they were close to landing the 45-year-old in 2012 before he decided to take a sabbatical and this strengthened Guardiola’s bargaining position with regard to the three-year contract he signed.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Video: Manuel Pellegrini to leave Manchester City at end of the season.
City are confident that now Pellegrini’s departure in the summer is official it will galvanise the squad into playing for the popular manager rather than making him a lame duck. Pellegrini has been aware of City’s preference for Guardiola since he replaced Roberto Mancini in June 2013 and would have been less accepting of the club’s move if it had been any other manager.

Pellegrini was informed of the decision last week by Khaldoon al Mubarak, the City chairman, and it is understood the relationship between the two men remains amicable.
The club have no problem with Pellegrini now talking with prospective clubs about where he may manage next. The view is that Chelsea could be interested and given the 62-year-old won the Premier League in his first season with City and wants to remain in English football Stamford Bridge would be of interest.
Guardiola was confirmed as Pellegrini’s successor on Monday when the usually introverted Chilean decided to offer the news in an unsolicited soundbite at the close of his press conference before Tuesday’s visit to Sunderland.
It suggested he may have driven the decision to make Guardiola’s appointment official. Pellegrini said: “Before I finish, I want to tell you I have talked with the club and I will finish my contract on the original date. I signed for one year more [to July 2017], but with the clause that the club or me can choose not to use that stuff now, so I finish here on the original date, 30 June, so there is not the speculation.
“The club are not doing anything behind me, I knew this one month ago, but I don’t think it’s good to have rumour or speculation about these things, so I prefer to finish today, which I why I have told the players and I have told the press. I also spoke to the club two weeks ago and said that I would do it.”
The club then released a statement. “Manchester City can confirm that in recent weeks it has commenced and finalised contractual negotiations with Pep Guardiola to become head coach for the 2016-17 season onwards. The contract is for three years. These negotiations were a re-commencement of discussions that were curtailed in 2012.
“Out of respect for Manuel Pellegrini and the players, the club wishes to make its decision public to remove the unnecessary burden of speculation. Manuel, who is fully supportive of the decision to make this communication, is entirely focused on achieving his targets for the season ahead and retains the respect and commitment of all involved with the leadership of the club.”
Mark Hughes, the Stoke City manager who has also been in charge at City, warned Guardiola the Premier League may be different to La Liga and the Bundesliga.
“I don’t think the news itself is a surprise, maybe the timing of the announcement. It is very interesting,” he said. “The Premier League is unlike any other league in world football. He has been very successful, of course, but he will still need a bit of adaptation.”
City believe they beat United and Chelsea to Guardiola’s signature, with sources at the club claiming “overtures” were made to the Spaniard. This, though, was denied at United and it is understood that as recently as December, the executive at Old Trafford viewed Guardiola’s favoured destination to be City."

Serie A|Sportblog|AC Milan|Internazionale|European club football|features,2016-02-01T14:05:59,guardian,Paolo Bandini,"Milan fans unfurled a banner depicting the English forward’s derby-winning header in 1984 before kick-off, and centre-back Alex recreated it as Milan enjoyed a rare derby success over Inter",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/feb/01/serie-a-milan-win-derby-inter-lose-control,Milan channel Mark Hateley to win derby as Inter and Roberto Mancini lose control,en,football,,"The Derby della Madonnina was preceded by a protest. As the minutes ticked down towards kick-off, a series of banners were unfurled at the red-and-black end of San Siro. “Years later, we are still in the same state,” read the message from Milan’s supporters in the Curva Sud. “A club cast adrift, with no ambition. A mediocre team with no champions. Today, just like back in the day, you win the derby by showing some balls.”
Building on that final thought, the same fans then unveiled a vast image of Mark Hateley, rising above Fulvio Collovati for a match-winning header against Internazionale in October 1984. The England striker experienced mixed fortunes in Italy, scoring a modest 17 goals in three Serie A seasons, but will always be remembered fondly by the Rossoneri for ending a sequence of five years without a derby win.
Milan take the derby honours with 3-0 win over Internazionale Read more
Milan needed a similar lift this weekend. They had beaten Inter just once in their last nine attempts, and trailed the Nerazzurri by eight points in the standings. Their recent form, admittedly, had been better than that of their neighbours, but Barbara Berlusconi told reporters on Thursday that the club’s realistic ambition for this season was simply to get back into the Europa League.
Inter were setting their sights rather higher. League leaders at Christmas, they had recently slipped to fourth but not yet given up on the Scudetto. At the very least, they were intent on securing a Champions League berth, and had gone out and signed Éder – joint-second in Serie A’s scoring charts - from Sampdoria to further their cause.
Milan 3-0 Internazionale: Serie A – as it happened Read more
Unlike their Milan counterparts, Inter’s supporters still had faith in their team. Despite a return of just five points from the last five games, a crowd of 300 or so Ultras from the Curva Nord turned out for an open training session on Saturday, armed with flares and flags. The new signing was celebrated with a banner that read ‘Cr-Eder-ci’, highlighting his name in the middle of the Italian word for ‘believe’. Éder rewarded such enthusiasm with two goals in an intra-squad practice match. Roberto Mancini put the player straight into his starting XI to face Milan, lining him up just behind Stevan Jovetic in attack.
José Mourinho had pulled a similar stunt six-and-a-half years previously, inserting Wesley Sneijder into Inter’s derby lineup one day after the Dutchman had arrived from Real Madrid. That proved to be a masterstroke, paving the way for a famous 4-0 win. And, who knows, perhaps Éder would have gone on to enjoy a similarly happy introduction, if he had only managed to put his header on target when Juan Jesus picked him out with a fine cross in the sixth minute of Sunday’s game.
Instead it was Milan who got to celebrate an instance of history repeating. With 10 minutes left in the first-half, their Brazilian centre-back Alex rose like Hateley over Davide Santon to crash a header into the Inter net. The symbolism was lost on nobody, with even the league’s official Twitter account posting photos of the two goals side by side. The only difference was that Alex had scored early; this left Inter with plenty of time to formulate a response. Their second-half introduction of Mauro Icardi threatened to turn the match on its head.
Serie A TIM (@SerieA_TIM) #MilanInter Alex su Santon come Hateley su Collovati, la foto stampata sulla coreografia del @acmilan. Spettacolo. pic.twitter.com/kvkWZfYHsn
The Argentinian had been dropped to the bench as punishment for missing a sitter against Carpi in the previous league fixture, with Mancini claiming that even he could have put away such a chance despite being in his 50s. Relations between the manager and his leading scorer have appeared strained of late but Icardi was eventually sent on to replace the ineffectual Jovetic shortly after the hour mark.
Within five minutes, Icardi had carved out Inter’s best chance of the match. He surged past Alex to reach an Adem Ljajic through-ball, before firing a vicious shot across goal. Milan’s goalkeeper, Gigi Donnarumma, could only parry the ball straight back into Icardi’s path.
Alex, who had gone to ground in a failed attempt to block the initial effort, now raised a boot towards the striker’s left calf. The contact looked minimal, and Icardi certainly made the most of it, but this was an extremely ill-judged challenge. Already booked, the defender could count himself lucky not to receive a second yellow card after referee Antonio Damato signalled for the penalty.
A further reprieve was to follow. Icardi stepped up to take the spot-kick, but clanged his shot against the right-hand post. The mistake was compounded moments later, when Carlos Bacca converted M’Baye Niang’s cross to double Milan’s lead. Niang himself then put the result beyond doubt, forcing the ball home at the second attempt after he was played in by Giacomo Bonaventura. Barely eight minutes after Icardi blew his chance to make the score 1-1, Inter instead found themselves 3-0 down. They could summon no further response.
And so, the team whose fans had begun the day with a protest finished it celebrating their best derby win for years. To an extent, fortune had favoured Milan: besides the Icardi miss, one might also consider that Niang was supposed to be on his way to Leicester last week. The Premier League club, after making enquiries, eventually opted against going through with a deal.
But Milan have also been better at getting results lately. They have lost only once since the defeat to Juventus in November, and have shown well in the big games, drawing away to Roma before beating Fiorentina 2-0. Their football has rarely looked fluid but with Bacca in such ruthless form it has not needed to be. He has scored with 11 of his 21 shots on target this season.
And for all the talk of reduced ambitions, Milan are a lot closer to the Champions League places than you might expect. Victory drew them to within five points of Inter, and to within six of third-placed Fiorentina.
Sinisa Mihajlovic had billed this derby as “an elevator”, explaining that: “The winner goes up, and the loser comes crashing down to earth.” If that sounds more like Disneyland’s Tower of Terror than any lift that I would counsel you to get in, it is nevertheless true that Inter appear dangerously close to freefall.
Sent off for excessive protests early in the second half, Mancini flipped the bird at Milan supporters as he headed for the tunnel, and lost his temper again during a subsequent TV interview. Asked by Mediaset’s Mikaela Calcagno whether his comments about Icardi’s miss against Carpi might have put extra pressure on the striker, Mancini accused her of talking “bullshit”.
When she followed up by asking whether he had indeed sworn at fans, he replied “I showed my middle finger to some who were insulting me and shouldn’t have been there, given that we have stewards. There, are you happy?” He later apologised, but actions will speak louder than words from here.
The concern is that Mancini’s loss of temper reflected his own feelings of losing control with his team. This was the second game in a row, following the midweek Coppa Italia defeat to Juventus, in which Inter have conceded three goals. Jeison Murillo, who fell flat on his face in the buildup to Milan’s third, is struggling badly, and a recent inability to keep clean sheets is only highlighting how turgid the team’s attacking play has been all season.
Perhaps Éder will help to put Inter back on track in the weeks ahead. But he will not soon be able to wipe away the memory of such a demoralising derby defeat.
Talking points
• Anything you can do, I can do better? It feels a little bit like that at the top of Serie A at the moment, with Juventus thrashing Chievo 4-0, only for Napoli to respond by walloping Empoli 5-1 later on the same afternoon. The Bianconeri have now equalled their club record streak of 12 consecutive top-flight victories but the Partenopei have won six in a row themselves (the first time they have done so since 1988) and remain two points clear atop the table. And it’s less than two weeks now until they meet in Turin …
• That’s the sixth time that Napoli have scored five goals in a game this season, by the way. And yes, Gonzalo Higuaín got one of them.
• Juventus lost Mario Mandzukic to a calf injury that is expected to keep him out for the next four weeks. That scenario would spell trouble for many teams, but the champions are hardly short of options with Alvaro Morata rediscovering his form at just the right moment. The Spaniard had gone nearly four months without a goal, but grabbed two in the Coppa Italia win over Inter and followed up with another brace against Chievo on Sunday.
• Paul Pogba’s still doing ridiculous things, too, in case you were wondering.
• Not that I imagine his presence would have changed the outcome on Sunday, but I do wonder whether Chievo will come to regret letting Alberto Paloschi depart in the middle of the season. The Flying Donkeys look comfortable enough right now in 11th place but no other player has scored more than four goals for them this season, and 27 points are not enough to feel safe with this many games left to play.
• Roma recorded their first win of this Luciano Spalletti era, with the help of a pair of new signings. Ervin Zukanovic supplied the cross, but it was Stephan El Shaarawy who produced the magic – beating the keeper with a backheel volley on the turn for the Giallorossi’s second goal. It would be nice to believe that this moment could mark the rebirth of a lost talent, but after previous false dawns I shall continue to hold judgment. If nothing else, the potential is still there for a player who only turned 23 in October.
• The situation only gets bleaker for Sampdoria, whose loss to Bologna was their seventh in 10 Serie A games under Vincenzo Montella. With Éder gone, and the advantage over 18th-placed Carpi (themselves unbeaten in five) down to four points, the risk of relegation looks very real indeed.

Manchester City believe they beat Manchester United and Chelsea to the hiring of Pep Guardiola, with the Spaniard receiving 11th hour “overtures” from each club due to an awareness he was close to agreeing to replace Manuel Pellegrini.
Guardiola, who will replace the Chilean on 1 July to start a three-year contract, had previously been targeted by United. Sir Alex Ferguson met the 45-year-old in September 2012 during Guardiola’s sabbatical to discuss him one day becoming manager at Old Trafford.

In the end Guardiola chose to join Bayern Munich, yet sources at City indicated that United had tried to revive the deal, with Chelsea also making overtures to the Spaniard having sacked José Mourinho at the end of last year.
As recently as December, United viewed Guardiola’s favoured destination to be City, yet given the state of uncertainty over Louis van Gaal’s future at Old Trafford it is thought the executive were compelled to persuade him to change his mind.
Chelsea require a manager for next season having hired Guud Hiddink as an interim head coach for the rest of this campaign following Mourinho’s departure."

Doumbia, who enjoyed successful spells in Switzerland with Young Boys and in Russia with CSKA Moscow, has struggled to make his mark in Serie A, where he has made only 13 league appearances for the Rome club.
“I’m delighted to be a Newcastle United player. I’ve already started to prepare. I’ve arrived and I’m ready to go,” said Doumbia, who completed his medical at Newcastle on Sunday and completed the formalities of his move on Monday. “It has always been a dream to play in the Premier League, so I’m absolutely delighted. I am looking forward to helping the club get some wins and climb the table.”
Newcastle had targeted West Brom’s Saido Berahino, for whom they made a £21m bid on Sunday.
Steve McClaren said: “It is no secret we have been looking to add to our options in the striking area. We have been searching for a forward and were delighted when the opportunity arose to take Seydou on loan. He is a natural goalscorer, someone who has scored goals in the Champions League and has played at the highest level. We believe he can make a mark in this team.”"

Transfer deadline day: Guardiola to replace Pellegrini at Manchester City this summer – live! Read more
City confirmed the worst kept secret in football by announcing Guardiola has signed a three-year contract to join them when he leaves Bayern Munich.
Klopp, who has already made the move from Bundesliga to Premier League after leaving Borussia Dortmund last season, admits there are no words he can offer to help Guardiola but has no doubt over the Spaniard’s ambitions.
“I don’t have any advice. He is one of the best managers in the world, no doubt about this,” he said. “He had two big clubs where he has worked at and now he will do his job at Manchester City.
“Pep won everything in Spain, nearly everything in Germany so I think he wants to win everything in England, that is clear. I know him but not well enough to know something about his real targets or reasons for coming here.
“The rumour for a long time was Man City and Pep seemed to be good friends or something like this so now they come together in the summer. I think it is good for both of course.
“At Bayern he has enough work to do but when he is here it will be a very warm welcome like I had when I came here.”"

The Fiver’s going to come clean. There we were sweating profusely as we tried to come up with Plain Old John Terry gags that were either not funny but legally OK, or, erm, not funny and still not legally OK (oh yes, it was really going to be a classic Fiver) when we saw Really Big Yellow Ticker of Doom pop up on our screen. Ah, maybe Daniel Trickett-Smith has finally joined Huddersfield on loan we thought. But no, in news that was even bigger than that, Pep Guardiola has been confirmed as Manchester City manager for next season. Poor old POJT, having his Fiver party crashed by a man who wasn’t even wearing a full kit and shin pads.
“Manchester City can confirm that in recent weeks it has commenced and finalised contractual negotiations with Pep Guardiola to become MCFC Head Coach for the 2016-17 EPL season onwards,” cheered a City suit, in news that was only marginally more surprising than Weird Uncle Fiver’s latest restraining order. And then in a highly uncalled for public kick in the stones for Manuel Pellegrini, the cold-hearted suit made it clear that the wise and lovely old owl currently perched in the City manager’s job was always second choice, nothing more than a football management equivalent of a cruise-control button. “The contract is for three years. These negotiations were a re-commencement of discussions that were curtailed in 2012. Out of respect for Manuel Pellegrini and the players, the club wishes to make its decision public to remove the unnecessary burden of speculation.” Yes, respect. Because being viewed as a corpse stalking the streets in a polyester Manchester City coat for the next five months is going to help Pellegrini do his job so much better now isn’t it?
At least Pep might be easier for The Fiver to relate to, what with his super smart appearance, fastidious attention to detail, huge ambition and searing success. Ah. So what can English football expect from a man so driven by detail that Manchester City employed Txiki Begiristain three years ago just to ensure the Etihad cushions were correctly plumped in time for his arrival? Well, he’ll probably be short on laughs (cough) and he’ll create formations that nobody understands, not even floating football brain in a jar, Jonathan Wilson, and certainly not the players. “Guardiola thinks about football and understands the machinations of the game at a level so deep that no one can follow,” revealed a Bayern Munich suit in a Big Paper interview a few months ago that got football hipsters twiddling their Brian Kilcline-styled facial hair with glee. It’s an approach that will surely go down well in the Premier League, where managers’ tactical plans go out of the window at the first sign of a gust of wind.
But one thing we can be sure of this afternoon is that no amount of cake will sweeten Yaya Touré’s mood, what with him having been escorted towards the Nou Camp’s door marked Do One by Pep in 2010. Here’s what Touré’s Mr 15%, Dimitri Seluk, had to say about Guardiola a couple of weeks ago: “The truth is that my grandfather would win the title with Barcelona and Bayern Munich because they are big clubs with great players. I’d like to see Pep take a club that is eighth or ninth and make them champions.” The Fiver’s going to take a wild guess and predict that Yaya will be a no-no when Pep steps in.

The positive mood has traveled with Clinton in her final stretch across Iowa, the state that on Monday will begin the first nominating contest of the 2016 race. Although Clinton remains locked in a competitive battle with Sanders, she holds a slight advantage here over the senator from Vermont.
The crowd cheered her frequently, but reserved its most thunderous reception for when Clinton ticked through priorities that included defending Planned Parenthood and marriage equality, protecting voting rights, and pushing for criminal justice reform and gun control.

US elections 2016|Iowa|Republicans|Democrats,2016-02-01T05:00:26,guardian,Ben Jacobs,Caucuses are the first stage in key voting states’ multi-part selection process and provide a litmus test for which party candidates who fare well in the primaries,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/01/iowa-caucuses-explainer-voter-information,Countdown to Iowa: a caucus guide for what to know about America's first vote,en,world|US,,"Caucuses are only the first stage in key voting states’ selection process and provide a litmus test for which party candidates could fare well in the primaries
The Iowa caucuses are a unique political institution that play a crucial role in the American primary process. However, they aren’t particularly intuitive to understand or follow. (Even though we’ll be live-blogging them all day and night at the Guardian from here across the first-in-the-nation voting state.)
What time do the caucuses start?
The caucuses start at 7pm local time on Monday, but campaigns encourage their supporters to show up half an hour early.
How do the caucuses unfold?
Very different rules govern the Democratic and Republican caucuses:
Republicans have a relatively straightforward process, in which they cast secret ballots in their precinct caucuses – church halls, school buildings.
By contrast, Democrats vote publicly in a two-stage election where candidates must get support of 15% of caucus-goers in each individual precinct to be viable. If they fall below that threshold, their voters need to choose another candidate or go home. After that redistribution, votes are counted and from those totals, delegates are assigned.
Lessons from Iowa: real caucus victory comes from beating expectations Read more
Can unregistered voters take part?
Any Iowan who will be over the age of 18 at the time of the presidential election (on 8 November) can participate. Attendees can register on the night at the caucuses and can switch their party affiliation there as well. This means a Democrat can go to the Republican caucuses and vice versa. Four years ago, 121,503 people showed up to the 2012 Republican caucuses. Democrats have traditionally had higher turnout and, in their last competitive caucus in 2008, 239,872 people attended.
What happens then?
The caucuses are political party-run processes with no state involvement, so the reporting of results doesn’t happen through state election officials. Instead, local volunteers at each caucus location across Iowa’s 99 counties report them. This means there can potentially be many hiccups:
For Republicans, the ballots are tallied and counted at each caucus site and reported to the state party.
Under the Democratic system, only the actual number of delegates pledged to each candidate is reported and not any actual vote counts.
Barring reporting issues, a clear idea of the results should emerge by around 9.30pm local time.
How are delegates decided?
American presidential primaries are all about electing delegates to the party conventions which are staged over the summer and where nominees to run for president will formally be chosen. The caucuses don’t formally select those delegates. Instead, they represent the first stage in Iowa’s multi-part selection process, but campaigns and the media will be able to extrapolate how many delegates they will receive based on Monday’s result.
After Iowa, three more states – New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada – will hold standalone, early contests in February. Then, starting 1 March, the calendar starts to fill up, beginning with “Super Tuesday”, when 12 states will hold nominating contests. The primary election will then continue until 7 June, when the final six states, including California, hold their elections.
Where will the candidates be on the night?
How the Iowa caucuses work: a confusing election process explained Read more
Most candidates will be holding election night parties in and around the state capitol of Des Moines on Monday night to watch the results. Some are already in New Hampshire, though. Ohio governor John Kasich has long since written off Iowa to campaign almost exclusively in the Granite state and former Florida governor Jeb Bush will fly to New Hampshire on Monday after a last minute campaign swing through Iowa. Both candidates are currently polling at 2% in Iowa.
What happens next?
Most of the candidates will go off to New Hampshire with charter planes expected to depart Des Moines for Manchester sometime after midnight on Tuesday morning. However, one or two Republican candidates may try to skip New Hampshire to shore up their campaigns in South Carolina, which holds the third Republican primary this year, and it’s likely that at least one candidate will end their campaign after Iowa.
• This article was amended on 4 February 2016 to clarify the answer to “Can unregistered voters take part?” An earlier version said “Any Iowan over the age of 18 can participate”."

The rural, snow-frosted landscape of Iowa is so sparse, the horizon so broad and the sky so huge that weather can declare itself with great ceremony. Rain, sleet and snow don’t just happen to you here – when the clouds part, you can see them coming.
Iowa caucus night live: high turnout reported for first vote of 2016 election Read more
As Iowans gather at caucus sites on Monday night to be the first people in the United States to help pick the next president, a blizzard will barrel over the plains. By the next morning, it will have dumped several inches of snow on the state as it heads north-west, leaving a trail of chaos and disruption.
This remains about the only clear prediction that anyone can make about what Iowa will look and feel like come Tuesday. This American primary season has been too volatile, dissentious and just plain eccentric for any overconfident forecast prior to the event.
The old rules, regarding financing, policy, gaffes, accuracy and media management, have ceased to apply. In normal times, for a candidate to call himself a socialist”, skip the final debate, denigrate entire religious and national groups or have emails become the subject of a federal inquiry would damage, if not destroy, that candidate’s prospects. An endorsement by Iowa’s main paper, the Des Moines Register, was once universally regarded as a coveted prize; today some see its support of Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio as a liability that paints them as establishment candidates.
Countdown to Iowa: a caucus guide for what to know about America's first vote Read more
And appearances can be deceptive. Some of the people who waited for close to two hours in sub-freezing temperatures in Marshalltown to see Donald Trump were Democrats who came for the show; others might be categorised as celebrity seekers who had no intention of caucusing.
On a basketball court at Clinton middle school, in the east of the state, as Elton John, the Stones and Adele blared, Billie Selser, who was waiting for Trump, said: “I watched him on TV, on The Apprentice. I’m interested to see what he has to say.” She and her husband Bruce had never voted in a caucus before – and struggled to recall ever having voted in a presidential election. They liked John F Kennedy, they agreed. “And Clinton – Bill Clinton wasn’t bad at all,” Bruce said. Then, asking about Trump, he said: “Is he Democrat, or more Republican?”
In 2004, Howard Dean – like Clinton’s current main rival, “democratic socialist” Bernie Sanders – drew the biggest and most passionate crowds here, ostensibly bringing new young people into the process. Dean finished a distant third when the passionate failed to show up or opted for something they knew was less radical but thought was more achievable.
But none of this means that the old rules may not reassert themselves when it matters – on the night itself. The Iowa caucuses, in which people actually have to show up at a definite time and stick around, are decided by relatively small numbers and carried by the most dedicated and the best organised.
Heather Johnson, a precinct captain for Hillary Clinton in Davenport, has been knocking on doors, calling supporters and galvanising the local faithful for months now. As the week ended, Barb Martney of Marshalltown, a Trump supporter, was still waiting for the campaign to send her the list of those leaning toward Trump in her area so she can remind them to show up. “I’ve asked for a list,” she told National Journal. “And there’s only a few days left, so I hope it’s soon.”
The Des Moines Register’s final poll, which has an impressive track record, gives Clinton a narrow lead over Sanders while Donald Trump holds a slightly wider but by no means unassailable edge over his main rival, conservative Texas senator Ted Cruz, ahead of the rest of the Republican pack.

The campaigns within the two parties have been quite different. With so many candidates and such an iconoclastic frontrunner, the Republicans’ race has been fragmented, fractious, unedifying and at times unhinged – a circular firing squad in which the gunmen episodically shoot themselves in the foot.
But history suggests Iowa Republicans are out of touch – of the last seven contested national caucuses, they have chosen the eventual nominee only three times. Presidents Santorum or Huckabee, anyone?
The Democratic race has been less entertaining and far more substantial and cordial. “We may have differences,” Clinton said of the Sanders divide on Sunday in Des Moines, “but issues is a lot better way to inform the electorate than insults, which is what you’re hearing from the Republicans.” It’s a more genteel version of 2008, with a gravelly, older white man – Sanders – playing a more politically radical, less personally appealing version of Barack Obama, while a more confident Clinton (playing herself) tries to parlay her inability to excite people into a virtue. “I’d rather under-promise and over-deliver,” is her new rally cry.
Lessons from Iowa: real caucus victory comes from beating expectations Read more
At least Iowa Democrats do tend to have a surer sense of the national pulse. Of the last six contested primaries, Iowans have picked the eventual nominee every time.
Despite the split between Democrats and Republicans, however, the mood dominating the contests in both parties has one common and important trait – nostalgia. Reagan announced a new morning in America; Bill Clinton posed as the boy from Hope at the helm of a “new generation of Democrats”; Obama invoked change. But the campaign themes that seem to be resonating most on both sides this time offer not a route to to a dazzling new tomorrow but a return to the financial securities and generational certainties of the past.
Sanders harnesses anger at the financial class for extorting the nation’s economics and distorting its politics. In the college town of Grinnell on Saturday, Sanders told students that the basic American birthright that each generation will enjoy a life better than the last has been stolen from them and must be recaptured. Some 24 hours later from Des Moines, he followed a star from The Hunger Games onstage: “Let me say it for the umpteenth time – I believe healthcare is a right not a privilege.”

In his signature campaign ad, Sanders doesn’t say a single word beyond his endorsement. Instead, Simon and Garfunkel’s America (released in 1968) plays over scenes of farmers tending their flock, wind turbines spinning over a rural idyll, graphic designers at work, a gay couple in an embrace, families going about their day and people campaigning for him. As they belt out the chorus “They’ve all come to look for America”, you’re left with the sense that the nation is lost and in need of retrieving. It couldn’t be more retro if it were in black and white.
Notably, at Sanders’ climactic rally on Saturday night, young supporters clutching neon pink flashing Bernie signs did not know the song – but they got the sentiment.
Trump, on the other hand, evokes a return to a time when being a white American meant something both at home and abroad – the citizen of an unrivalled superpower, with a monocultural polity, that intervenes in the world with the sole purpose of asserting its supremacy. It’s an era before wars were lost in Muslim lands, white life expectancy started falling, the Latino population started booming and “political correctness” forbade white Christian men from saying whatever came in to their heads.
Outside Trump’s rallies, you can buy hats emblazoned with his slogan “Make America Great Again” and badges stating “Bomb the shit out of Isis” and “Hillary for prison 2016”. They play guitar in cowboy hats.
Gary Younge (@garyyounge) Oh, there was this as well pic.twitter.com/ftoddKMF9g
Inside, Trump bloviates like a drunk uncle at a barbecue: “The Chinese want to steal everything we have”; “Glenn Beck is a nut job”; “It’s going to be a real wall. It’s going to be a big wall. We can build it so big, so beautiful, so strong, so powerful”; “Obamacare is a disaster, by the way”; “We can’t have people chopping off heads.”
On Sunday afternoon at a gymnasium in Council Bluffs, Trump finally lightened up. His wife, Melania, had finally emerged alongside him, to complement the mogul turned frontrunner as “unbelievable, the best deal maker, the best master negotiator”.
“Thank you, honey,” he said with slightly less bluster, before the snow came in. “That’s so nice.”
Sanders and Trump could not be more different. The former focuses frustration on the powerful, the latter on the powerless. But the source of that frustration is the essentially the same. Wages are stagnant, a generation of wealth has been wiped out, social mobility has stalled, and the government doesn’t work. Sanders rails against big money in politics; one of the things Trump’s supporters like about him is that he’s so rich he can’t be bought.
Sanders and Trump are not the only candidates. But they have set the tone for the campaigns on both sides pulling the field to the left and right, respectively. When they announced their candidacies, conventional wisdom suggested neither was in with a shot. “When we started this we had three people, we had no name recognition and no money, and we were 50 points down in the polls,” said Sanders’ Iowa campaign co-ordinator on Sunday. Now both are viable.
But then, conventional wisdom has counted little in this campaign. These are uncharted waters. And there’s a big storm brewing.

Election live: Trump and Clinton lead on day of Iowa caucuses Read more
It was almost the top reveal of a last-minute bid for transparency required by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as the deadline for the final 2015 reports on donations and financing ran up against the morning of the first 2016 voting day of the campaign for the White House.
The disclosures led to all sorts of fascinating insights into the campaigns: Jeb Bush’s average donations per day plunged along with his poll numbers, from more than $500,000 to less than $90,000 over the course of October, November and December. A Super Pac associated with Hillary Clinton spent $300 on shredding, and got millions from the billionaire George Soros.
But perhaps most interesting of all – at least to the casual campaign observer who may have grown used to the piles of outside spending as Monday’s Iowa caucuses approached in earnest – was the disclosure that the Trump campaign spent $326,699.85 during the final quarter of 2015 with one company on “hats”.
Politico tallied the total hat expenditures at about $450,000, as part of some $940,000 on campaign memorabilia.

Trump donned the hat – featuring the campaign slogan he cribbed from Ronald Reagan – through the majority of his upstart campaign, with the New York Times quickly declaring it an “ironic must-have fashion accessory”.
The official Trump campaign hats are manufactured by a company called Cali-Fame, in Carson, California, which had to hire 20 additional employees once it became the mogul’s hipster hat-maker of choice, according to a Los Angeles Fox affiliate.
The workers who stitch the hats are overwhelmingly Latino – a group the candidate has alienated aggressively over the course of his campaign with sweeping anti-immigration policy proposals, including building a wall between the US and Mexico. Cali-Fame president Brian Kennedy told the Los Angeles Times that he had to address his 80% Latino workforce when the orders started coming in from Trump. “I said to them, ‘We’re not political. We’re here to work,’” Kennedy told the Times.
Yolanda Melendrez, an immigrant from Mexico who works at the Cali-Fame factory, told the Times: “When we first got the order, I said to myself, ‘Just wait until he sees who’s making his hats.’ We’re Latinos, we’re Mexicans, Salvadoreños.”
The campaign sells each hat for $25. Trump’s estimated profits from his own accessory remained unclear and were not mandated by the FEC."

On the eve of the Iowa caucuses, eight years after the crushing disappointment of her defeat by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton made her final pitch to a gymnasium packed with roughly 2,600 people.
Election live: Trump and Clinton lead on day of Iowa caucuses Read more
The crowd was not just one of the largest of her campaign – it also rivaled in its enthusiasm scenes that have become synonymous with rallies held by her opponent, Bernie Sanders.
On Sunday night, Clinton delivered a resounding speech. Accompanied by her husband Bill and daughter Chelsea, the former secretary of state fashioned herself as a pragmatic progressive with a history of accomplishment to match her soaring rhetoric.
“I hope you will caucus for me. I hope you will fight for me,” she implored. “I will fight for you.”
The same night in Des Moines, around 1,700 people attended Sanders’ Sunday night rally. A crowd as large as 5,000 saw him joined by indie band Vampire Weekend at the University of Iowa on Saturday.
Iowa caucus results are as unpredictable as this bizarre election season Read more
Hours before Clinton’s final rally, hundreds formed a line that wrapped around an entire neighborhood. They eventually packed a high school gymnasium, bustling with excitement echoed through frequent chants of “Hillary! Hillary!” and “I believe she will win.”
The positive mood has traveled with Clinton in her final stretch across Iowa, the state that on Monday begins the first nominating contest of the 2016 race. Although Clinton remains locked in a competitive battle with Sanders, she holds a slight advantage: 45% to 42% in Saturday’s final Des Moines Register poll.
In combating Sanders and his grassroots movement, Clinton has focused her message on the need to build upon and expand the legacies of the last two Democratic presidents: her husband and Barack Obama. Introducing her, Bill Clinton struck similar themes.
“She’s a world-class change-maker,” he said, adding that a president must be capable of finding common ground without sacrificing core principles.
“Of all of the people I have ever worked with in my public life, Hillary is the best at that.”
Much of Clinton’s closing argument in Iowa and New Hampshire has centered around the idea that the policies put forward by Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist, might sound appealing but are ultimately impractical.
She has challenged the Vermont senator over his support for single-payer healthcare, which Clinton said poses an existential threat to Obama’s healthcare law, which remains popular among Democrats.
“Senator Sanders wants to start over – to plunge us into a contentious national debate,” Clinton said, before noting how hard fought a victory healthcare had already been.
“Stick with the Affordable Care Act, stick with making it better,” she said.

Clinton also took a veiled shot at Sanders by vowing not to raise taxes on the middle class, following an acknowledgement by the senator’s campaign that his healthcare plan would require a tax hike on most Americans – in return, they say, for larger savings on insurance costs.
“I will not raise middle class taxes – absolutely off the table. I will follow the money to the top,” Clinton said.
There were, nonetheless, moments in which Clinton echoed Sanders’ economic populism.
“We also have to keep our eye on Wall Street. We can’t ever let it wreck Main Street again,” she said.
The crowd cheered frequently, but reserved its most thunderous reception for when Clinton ticked through priorities that included defending Planned Parenthood and marriage equality, protecting voting rights and pushing for criminal justice reform and gun control.
“I’m a better candidate,” she told them, “and, thanks to you, I’ll be a better president.”"

Four years ago at the Pizza Ranch outside Des Moines, when Rick Santorum was on the verge of an upset beyond historic proportions, he drew a massive crowd that packed the local Iowa chain restaurant. Groups of reporters were pinned against the salad bar. You could barely move. The former Pennsylvania senator had to give two different speeches, one with a bullhorn.
Election live: Trump and Clinton lead on day of Iowa caucuses Read more
Four years later, on Sunday night back at the Pizza Ranch where this indefatigable social conservative had strode to victory over Mitt Romney and won the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, the mood was totally different. This was no campaign rally; it was a wake.
Sure, Santorum filled the party room, but only a handful of reporters were present. The parking lot, at least, was filled with Santorum bumper stickers from all over. These were the loyal supporters: staff members, volunteers, even longtime mega-donor Foster Friess. These were the people who had been with Santorum since he was at 2% in the polls back in 2011 and stood by him throughout the political rollercoaster ride that followed.
They are with him again now, back at 2%.

In both of his campaigns, Santorum has made the retail campaigning mega-tour of visiting each of Iowa’s 99 counties. In 2012, it gave him the grassroots support that he needed to win. In 2016, Santorum’s long haul means nothing as Ted Cruz has usurped his role as mantle-holder of the evangelical right and Donald Trump has swallowed up all the media attention.
Iowa underdogs put on brave faces despite all but inevitable defeats Read more
Santorum arrived insisting he was going to do a real town hall. After all, he had performed 700 events like this one in the past five years and was going to end on a strong note. He maintained confidence that he could somehow pull off another, even more improbable upset, noting that 36% of his supporters made up their mind on caucus night in 2012 and that even more people could still be persuaded this year.
He insisted that the undercard debates, all of which he participated in, had demeaned the second-tier polling candidates. To Santorum, there was a need for “serious candidates to be taken seriously”. He dismissed polls and instead told Iowans to “vote your convictions”.
By the end of Sunday night’s wake, it became more of a valedictory. Santorum was made an honorary Pizza Ranch employee. His campaign chairman noted that he had been to 120 of the chain’s locations. He was presented with a Pizza Ranch T-shirt – a fleece, too.

Santorum told attendees that he liked campaigning in Iowa “beyond measure and I have learned so much from it”. He hoped to come back to a Pizza Ranch next time.
“When I come in on Air Force One,” he joked, “there may not be as many of these types of deals.”
When Trump made his lone appearance at a Pizza Ranch earlier in January, the company’s CEO, Adrie Groeneweg, appeared to endorse him. Santorum got the honorary swag from his own campaign staffers.
All the same, Santorum seemed grateful. He was moved by the presentation, and stayed to take selfies with well-wishers and supporters long after he stopped speaking.
One Pizza Ranch miracle had worked before, he figured; there was no reason for him to suppose that it couldn’t happen again."

When the Iowa conservative Simon Conway takes the airwaves on WHO-AM, the biggest talk radio station in the state, an introduction set to country music proclaims him to be “one of the proudest citizens of the United States, ever”.
Election live: Trump and Clinton lead on day of Iowa caucuses Read more
Such a patriotic opening isn’t unusual for any rightwing talkshow host – particularly one who, in Conway’s case, will on Monday interview six Republican candidates on the day of the caucuses.
What is unusual is that when Conway takes the microphone, he speaks in a posh – for Des Moines – if estuary-inflected English accent.
Although Conway takes pains to “point out I am American – born British, naturalized American now”, the accent does make him a somewhat unusual kingmaker. Tea Party radio hosts in early voting states are not often born in London.
After a career in journalism and corporate communications in the UK, Conway moved to Orlando, Florida, in 2001. He entered the real estate business, which he found very competitive.
“There are thousands of people selling real estate in Orlando, literally,” he told the Guardian.
So he tried to distinguish himself by buying time on the radio. He got himself a one-hour weekend show and fell in love with the medium.
Iowa caucus results are as unpredictable as this bizarre election season Read more
“From the very first moment I was on the air,” he said, “I did not talk about real estate. It was like an epiphany. I had come home.”
Conway fell into a career as a fill-in talkshow host, travelling across the US to what he described as “major, major stations”. In 2011, he took a job at WHO.
He also had an offer in New Orleans, a city that is by some accounts far more interesting than Des Moines, but he turned it down.
Speaking to the Guardian, as he enthused about his Iowa workplace, one the most recognized and honored radio stations in the US and a longtime employer of Ronald Reagan, he said: “If you’re serious about talk radio, this isn’t a job you turn down.”
His training in Britain formed his aggressive approach on the air, he said.
“I am an equal-opportunity hater. I treat people the same whether I agree with them or [they] don’t agree with me. I will always challenge their positions.
“There are [as many] Republicans who don’t want to face those questions as there are Democrats. The likes of [Ohio governor] John Kasich haven’t been in my studio because he knows it isn’t going to end well.”
Conway worries, meanwhile, that the US is becoming like Great Britain.
“People rely on government too much in the UK,” he said. “‘Government is the solution. Government will take care of me.’”
In the US, he said, “we are becoming that people”.
In the promos for his show, Conway says “he has already lived through where we are headed”.
On Monday, just before Iowans head to the caucuses, he will share such warnings again, not just with a listening audience of tens of thousands, but potentially the next president as well."

New Hampshire was supposed to be where Jeb Bush made his comeback. Or where Chris Christie had his breakout moment. Or where Marco Rubio solidified his momentum.
Election live: Trump and Clinton lead on day of Iowa caucuses Read more
In the last few days, though, Governor John Kasich of Ohio has had New Hampshire all to himself. The rest of the Republican field is in Iowa, in search of last-minute votes. On Sunday, Kasich held his 85th and 86th town hall events in the eastern state.
“I’m a lot more interested in talking about what I’m for than the people who are in the primary up here in New Hampshire,” Kasich said to dozens of voters who came out on a sunny winter’s day in Salem.
“I want to raise the bar. I want us to regain hope in this country. We can make this country work again.”
The audience broke into applause.
While his opponents tap into voter frustration, preaching doom and gloom, Kasich is wooing moderate Republicans and independents at schools, churches, gymnasiums and community centers across the state with a decidedly sunny vision for the country. It seems to be working.
A series of recent state polls have shown Kasich’s steady rise – and complicated path forward. Most place him in a virtual tie for second place with three candidates: Bush, Rubio and Ted Cruz. A realclearpolitics.com average of state polls confirms his second-place standing in New Hampshire, behind the longtime Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump.
In Bow on Sunday night, with a national debt clock ticking behind him, Kasich cast himself as a conservative, pointing to his record on fiscal issues in Congress and as governor of Ohio. He also pitched himself as a man willing to work across the aisle.
You laugh, but you know that’s how it works John Kasich, on reaching across the aisle
He told the crowd he had a plan for ending gridlock in Congress. Part of his initial 100-day plan in the White House would include obtaining the phone numbers of the parents of each member of Congress, so he could call them on their birthdays.
“That way I can get them to say to their son or daughter, ‘Hey, the president called me today, you better not cross him because I like him. He wished me a happy birthday,’” Kasich said.
“You laugh, but you know that’s how it works.”
With New Hampshire voters, Kasich deploys a mix of predictable humor (“I’ve not had that many town halls yet. This is only my 85th.”) and the folksy touch (“Here’s the thing, kiddo.”) that seems to be paying off.
He has picked up endorsements from seven of the eight local newspaper editorial boards and on Saturday he won endorsements from the Boston Globe and the New York Times. The latter paper’s editorial board called Kasich the “only plausible choice for Republicans”.
Kasich said on Sunday he was “thrilled” to have won such high-profile endorsements.
“It really illustrates for a lot of people that Kasich’s a conservative but he has wide appeal,” he told reporters. “He can get people to come who traditionally don’t go. And the last guy I can think of who could do that is Ronald Reagan.”
In two campaign stops on Sunday, Kasich was asked about climate change, religious freedom, immigration, creationism and American exceptionalism. In each case, he replied carefully – no doubt wary of attacks from his opponents that his views are too liberal and or inconsistent. His answers were nonetheless decidedly, even confidently moderate.
“If you’re in the cupcake business and somebody comes in and wants cupcakes, sell them cupcakes,” Kasich told a voter who was concerned about the erosion of religious liberties. “That’s my feeling about that. I won’t have an argument about who you’re selling the cupcake to, I just don’t agree with that.”
When a first-time voter asked him why Republicans shy away from the topic of climate change, Kasich told him: “Do I believe that human beings affect the climate? I do. But we don’t quite know how much. But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t things we need to do.”
However, on abortion and defunding Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest women’s health organization, Kasich is staunchly conservative. He has declared himself “pro-life”, except in cases of rape or incest or if a woman’s life is in danger.
New Hampshire and beyond

On Monday, in the final hours before Iowa voters go to the caucuses, Kasich was scheduled to hold three town hall meetings in New Hampshire.
He has mostly forsaken the race in Iowa, placing his best hopes in a state he hopes will power his campaign through the next few primaries and on to Super Tuesday and beyond.
Tom Rath, a senior adviser to the Kasich campaign, said the governor’s aim was to be “the story” coming out of the New Hampshire primary on 9 February. A strong finish in New Hampshire, emerging as the clear establishment favorite, would position Kasich to compete for the blue and purple midwestern states, including his homestate of Ohio, Rath said.
But if Kasich does place favorably in New Hampshire, he will still face a long road ahead to the nomination. He’ll have to clear the so-called “establishment” lane of the Republican contest, which he currently shares uncomfortably with Rubio, Christie and Bush. It’s also a lane voters seem to be turning away from in droves, borne out by the support for the anti-establishment, outsider candidacy of Trump.
Kasich, Rath said, stands a good chance of becoming the nominee if voters choose the path of least resistance rather than the road less traveled.
“There are some people who are ideologically center-right. I call them ‘governing conservatives’,” Rath said, refusing to use the “establishment” label. “That’s the lane I think people fit him in and that’s the lane I think he’s clearly gaining traction in.
“If we color too far outside the lines and don’t get somebody in that lane, especially if Secretary Clinton’s on the other side, we run a big risk.”
He’s the opposite of Trump. I believe people are going to get tired of the show. Eventually they will want the genuine.” Stacey Gobron, independent voter
Stacey Gobron, one of the state’s coveted undecided independent voters, said her husband, Bob, had brought her to the Kasich event in Salem. She had been disappointed by the Republican party’s frontrunners and was hoping to hear something different.
“I want low taxes like a Republican but I’m also not so [socially] conservative,” Gobron said.
After hearing Kasich speak, Gobron said she believed she had found a candidate to support and was optimistic others like her would come around as well.
“He’s so genuine and I feel there’s an honesty about him,” Gobron said. “He’s the opposite of Trump. I really believe people are going to get tired of the show. Eventually they will want the genuine.”
But voters aren’t the only ones paying attention to Kasich’s quiet town hall meetings. His steady climb in the New Hampshire polls has attracted the attention of at least three outside groups opposing him or supporting his opponents. Those groups have attacked him with television and mail advertisements in New Hampshire and Iowa.

The Bush-supporting Super Pac Right to Rise targeted Kasich with New Hampshire mail advertisements over his decision to expand Medicare in Ohio and for his record on guns. In mail sent to New Hampshire voters America Leads, a Super Pac supporting Christie, branded Kasich a tax-raiser.
Kasich called it “fantastic” that his opponents, particularly Bush’s well-financed allies, view him as a rival – especially in Iowa where he hasn’t been competitive.
“Well, they got like $110m,” Kasich told reporters outside the event in Salem. “They’ve spent $40m or $50m trying to sell Jeb in a positive way – that didn’t work. So now he’s playing whack-a-mole. And he’s just beating everybody that pops up.
“So I was totally amused to find out that I’ve spent $140,000 in Iowa and he’s spent $40m and they’re beating me up in Iowa. Fantastic.”
On Sunday evening in Bow, Kasich ended his fifth town hall of the weekend with a final pitch.
“Come on,” he teased. “Gimme the vote, would ya?”"

Premier League transfer window January 2016: club-by-club verdicts Read more
The Hornets first attempted to sign the 23-year-old in August, agreeing a fee with his club but failing to convince the player, whose partner was pregnant at the time, to relocate. They had intended to renew their efforts to complete a deal at the end of the season, but upon learning that Doucouré had attracted serious interest from other Premier League clubs – with Tottenham and Liverpool believed to be among their number – decided to act immediately rather than risk losing him to a rival, and agreed a deal valued at a little over £8m.
In Étienne Capoue – briefly the club’s record signing himself when he arrived in July – Ben Watson and Valon Behrami, Watford already have three established central midfielders, and signed another, the Spanish international Mario Suárez, over the weekend. With no time to sell before the deadline, Doucouré’s arrival would have forced them to leave one of these players out of their Premier League squad for the remainder of the season.
It is a problem they solved by immediately loaning Doucouré to Granada, like Watford owned by members of the Pozzo family, for the remainder of the season. The player is thus faced with relocating his young family twice in six months, and though he was not initially keen to consent to this arrangement he was eventually persuaded that his ambition to play in the Premier League would be best served by doing so.
Granada were also heavily involved in Watford’s other deadline day signing, transferring ownership of the highly-rated 18-year-old Venezuelan forward Adalberto Peñaranda. Like Doucouré, he has signed a four-and-a-half-year contract, though his arrival in Hertfordshire will be even more delayed than the Frenchman’s: he will remain on loan at Granada until the summer of 2017, and the Spanish club suggested the primary motivation for the move was to tie the player to a contract with no buy-out clause, which are mandatory in Spain. Peñaranda, the youngest goalscorer in Granada’s history, attracted headlines for being involved in the wrong kind of shooting last year, when a bullet passed through his thigh after gunfire broke out at a party he was attending in his homeland."

In perhaps Monday’s oddest transfer Steven Fletcher swapped a relegation battle at the Stadium of Light for mid-table security at the Stade Vélodrome as Sunderland’s out-of-favour Scotland striker signed for Marseille on loan.
The 28-year-old – whose departure prompted plenty of quips about there being one Scot in France this summer after all – may not have impressed Sam Allardyce but the Ligue One side have apparently identified him as the perfect attacking partner for the much coveted Michy Batshuayi.
Transfer deadline day: Imbula, Rhodes, Berahino and the latest updates – live! Read more
Fletcher, who cost £12m when Martin O’Neill brought him to the north-east from Wolves in 2012, has made only 10 appearances under Allardyce and was entering the final six months of his contract at Sunderland.
Michel, the Marseille manager, is said to believe the partnership with Fletcher – who has scored four times in 16 games this season – could prove instrumental in persuading Batshuayi to stay put in the south of France. A prolific 22-year-old Belgian, Batshuayi averages a goal every other game and is admired by, among others Stoke, Newcastle and Spurs. Indeed, Stoke and Newcastle are understood to have made late bids for him before the transfer window closed.
Overall Fletcher scored 23 goals in 86 matches at Sunderland but now he will be receiving crosses from two former Newcastle United wingers, Rémy Cabella and Florian Thauvin, the latter having newly arrived back at Marseille on loan from St James’ Park.
After signing Wahbi Khazri, the Tunisia playmaker, from Bordeaux for £9m over the weekend, Allardyce needed to balance his budget on Wearside and offloading the well remunerated Fletcher for a loan fee went some way towards achieving that aim, particularly as Marseille are believed to be paying 100% of the striker’s wages.

Arsenal’s Arsène Wenger: Tomas Rosicky devastated by injury setback Read more
Earlier on Monday, the Arsenal manager suggested that the 30-year-old would make the temporary switch to a Premier League club, with Aston Villa and Sunderland keen. But, after training with Arsenal in the morning, he has ended up at Bordeaux.
Debuchy joined Arsenal from Newcastle United in July 2014 for £12m but his first season at the club was undermined by serious injuries, first to his ankle and then to his shoulder – both of which required surgery.
He lost his place in the team to Héctor Bellerín and this season he has been on the periphery, making only seven appearances and often looking off the pace when selected. He is desperate to rediscover his pre-injury form and rhythm in order to make Didier Deschamps’ squad for the Euro finals this summer.
Wenger has also loaned the striker Yaya Sanogo to Charlton Athletic for the rest of the season. The 23-year-old had spent the first half of the campaign on loan at Ajax but he made only four appearances.
Arsenal profited last season when the midfielder Francis Coquelin spent a period on loan at Charlton. When he was recalled, Coquelin went straight into the Arsenal team and he has not looked back since."

Premier League transfer window January 2016: club-by-club verdicts Read more
Niasse became the third most expensive transfer in Everton’s history, behind £28m Romelu Lukaku and £15m Marouane Fellaini, when he signed a four-and-a-half-year contract on deadline day. The 25-year-old was scouted by Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United and Aston Villa while scoring 13 goals in 23 games for Lokomotiv this season, also providing 10 assists, but Everton made the first significant bid for Russia’s Premier League player of the year for 2015. Bayer Leverkusen and Monaco had offers rejected for the 44-times capped Senegal striker, who wanted a move to the Premier League because his wife is based in Manchester.
The forward, who could be eligible to make his Everton debut at Stoke City on Saturday, said: “It’s a great day for me, a big dream to play in the Premier League and a big dream to play for Everton. I know Everton is one of the big clubs here in England with history, the fans and the great players, so I’m very excited and happy to be here.
“I started to watch Everton more since the beginning of October because I had heard about their interest. I was interested to see how they play and how they have good young players. If you see players who are aged 20 or 21 and see them perform like that, you know you have a good coach. The manager has said exactly what he wants. He believes I can be a player who can add something to the team. It was not difficult to talk and understand one another. You can see also that he is a good person and I am really looking forward to playing for my new team.”
Everton’s outlay on another striker will inevitably raise questions about Lukaku’s future, with the club’s leading goalscorer expected to be targeted by several European clubs this summer, but Martínez claims Niasse represents a different option to the strikers at his disposal.
Stoke confirm signing of Giannelli Imbula for club record £18.3m Read more
The Everton manager said: “We’re delighted because Oumar is a player we have been following for a long time. He is the right personality and someone who is in a very good moment of his career. He has had a lot of success in Russia and he brings a different quality to what we already have in our squad. He’s got a really good physicality – he is very strong and powerful.
“It’s not just scoring goals, he penetrates teams and opens up teams in the final third, which allows others to benefit from his work as well. He is a strong, powerful striker who can play in different positions.
“He is going to be a terrific, fresh addition to a squad that will welcome his ability.”
Niasse has not played a competitive fixture since 10 December due to the break in the Russian league season and Martínez said: “He’ll need a little bit of time to understand the Premier League, with the tempo and all the new aspects of the league. But I wouldn’t expect too long because he is the type of player who can have an impact in any game.”

Jürgen Klopp has hailed Manchester City’s appointment of “one of the best managers in the world” but warned Pep Guardiola he will find supremacy harder to achieve in the Premier League than in Germany or Spain.
The former Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich coaches will renew their rivalry next season when Guardiola replaces Manuel Pellegrini as the City manager. Klopp was fulsome in his praise of the Catalan following Monday’s announcement, describing him as a “really nice guy, really smart” and one of the game’s elite managers.
Guardiola is on course to lift a third consecutive Bundesliga title with Bayern, having achieved the same feat at Barcelona between 2009 and 2011, but the Liverpool manager believes stronger competition will prevent him achieving such dominance in England.

Asked whether Guardiola will bring success to City, Klopp said: “I really wish all the people around the world the best of luck but we plan to avoid that! Manchester City is a club with not-too-bad possibilities on the financial side, shall we say, and Pep Guardiola is a really smart person.
“He won’t have chosen Man City because of his friendship with a few people there. They won’t have the worst team in the world next year but I love football because that doesn’t mean everything. As we have shown once or twice you can beat these teams.
“We will see what happens but I cannot be interested in this now like everyone else is. I will see him for the first time maybe in July or August, that’s a long time from now. He will enjoy the league because it is a great league and a real competition and he is a real competitor. That is what he wants. I don’t think it will be the same situation as he had in Spain, with Barcelona on the top level, or in Germany with Bayern on the top level, but of course Man City has good possibilities. We will try to beat them.”

Liverpool visit Leicester City on Tuesdaywith the hosts’ position at the Premier League summit underlining Klopp’s argument. His first transfer window as the Liverpool manager closed without a deal for Alex Teixeira after Shakhtar Donetsk placed a €70m (£53m) price on the Brazilian forward and refused to consider a sale in January. Klopp claimed he was not disheartened by the club’s relative inactivity and urged supporters to trust his decision not to pay more than €32m for Teixeira.
“It’s very important that you can trust us,” he said. “It was a common decision on Teixeira. We said we can’t play this game until the end. We made offers, I won’t say too much about that, but they were realistic with the plusses of it being January, the Premier League, all the plusses you have when you make negotiations. But it was a case of: ‘If you don’t want it, OK, we can’t change the situation, both for now and the future’.
“It’s not that we haven’t got money but you have to work respectfully and responsibly. That’s what we do.
“It is not like you should buy and sell, buy and sell. In my opinion, usually I make a one-year contract with the players. I know they have longer contracts, but I say: ’Yes, if you don’t play the biggest rubbish in your life, I will trust you, you have to trust me.’ And after a year, maybe he wants somewhere else, maybe I want him to go somewhere else. That’s football. Now in the middle of the season, I have been here for four months and nothing has happened on transfers. I am fine with that and we can go on working.”"

Tomas Rosicky has been left “devastated” by another injury setback in what could be his final season as an Arsenal player, according to Arsène Wenger.
Arsenal’s Mathieu Debuchy joins Bordeaux on loan until end of season Read more
Rosicky sustained a thigh injury against Burnley in the FA Cup and underwent a scan on the problem on Monday, having only come on in the 71st minute during his first match of the campaign. It is the latest blow for the Czech Republic captain, who has suffered numerous injuries since joining the club in 2006, most recently a knee issue.
The 35-year-old, who has made 170 appearances in the Premier League over 10 years, is not expected to be offered a new contract at Arsenal when his current deal expires in the summer, meaning his final months at the club could be spent on the sidelines. Wenger did not know how long the midfielder would be out for but it is thought Rosicky – who had not played since June – will miss at least one month.
Asked how he sustained the injury, Wenger said: “Nobody understands. I told him straight away after half-time to warm up. I observed him, he’s very conscientious Tomas, he did sprint and sprint, and sprint. He comes on; after three minutes he got the injury.
“I looked at him and thought: ‘Tomas you do not run properly’ because he didn’t lift his legs and he lost some balls. I was amazed because he is at the top level technically. He told me after the game that he did it [the injury] straight away.
“He warmed up well, for 20 minutes. He’s devastated. Unbelievable. He’s such a good player but his career has been disrupted by so many injuries. He was born in 1980, he’s 35, it’s difficult for him. Let’s hope we have good news, that it is not as bad as feared.”
Arsenal play Southampton in the league at the Emirates on Tuesday night, one month after they were comprehensively beaten 4-0 by Ronald Koeman’s side. Other than Rosicky, Wenger will be able to select from a fully fit squad, with Mesut Özil likely to return to the starting lineup after being rested in the Cup.

The Arsenal manager blamed the defeat at St Mary’s on a lack of mental focus but said his side’s ability to respond to a disappointing result has improved. “I think the team has a good mentality, a good level of humility and a good togetherness,” he said. “Humility means that you question your performance every time, that you are ready to put a shift in. This team relies a lot on work rate.
“Southampton have a good team and let’s not forget they won at Man United, they won at Chelsea, they are a team with quality players like Tadic, Mané, Long, Pellè, Fonte at the back, Wanyama. They are a team with top quality.”
“I felt on the day [in December] we did not have the mental energy. We put a lot in. It was Christmas, we always go to Southampton at the Christmas period. We got caught by a team that was full of desire.”"

The 23-year-old was a record signing when Porto bought him for €20m from Marseille in 2015​​ but Stoke have been working on the deal for a month after Hughes was impressed with the player during his side’s pre-season friendly against Porto last summer.
Imbula has made seven appearances for France Under-21s but has yet to earn a full cap for Les Bleus and could switch his national allegiance to Belgium, where he was born. He becomes Stoke’s record signing, after the arrival of Xherdan Shaqiri in August last year​ for £12m, and has signed a five-and-a-half-year deal.
Hughes, the Stoke manager, said: “He’s a good young player, good power, good ability on the ball, a good range of passing, someone who will come in and add to the quality we’ve already got. Having seen him first hand that experience resonated with me when it was mooted that he may be available this window.
“From that point onwards we’ve tried to speak to the right people. It’s not something we’ve jumped into at the last minute. There’s a lot of work that has been done in the last month or so. It’s progressed significantly quicker this morning. Last night [Sunday] it was seemingly a little bit difficult but it’s progressed.”
Asked about how the club have backed him in the market, Hughes said: “I think it’s important that when we go into the market we try and bring good quality in. When you’re trying to move and become a different club in terms of aspiration and expectation then you have to get the players to drive that. I’ve tried to bring the right quality in. I’ve always felt I’ve had the backing of the club to do something. It’s another example today. It’s a huge vote of confidence from the owners.”

The Aston Villa manager, Rémi Garde, has indicated he may reassess his position in the summer after failing to land any of his transfer targets.
The Frenchman has missed out on all of the players he wanted to aid Villa’s survival bid in the Barclays Premier League. Garde wanted Seydou Doumbia, who instead joined Newcastle on loan from Roma, while Wahbi Khazri signed for Sunderland, and a deal for Hajduk Split goalkeeper Lovre Kalinic collapsed after a work permit appeal was rejected.

Garde is understood to have been left disappointed with Villa’s barren transfer window. He has also hinted Villa’s transfer and financial plans may have changed since he became manager in November, with the club now 10 points from safety.
“Maybe it was not as clear when I signed, but it’s something that I don’t want to discuss too much,” Garde said.
“I understand that you cannot carry on doing the same things when you have not been as successful as you have wanted. I cannot say the club hasn’t done everything they could. It wouldn’t be fair. I’m not happy about this situation. I am not stupid and saying we need nobody.
“Some people have to be brave enough to say what have we done wrong in the past and what we should be doing now to stop that and to be better, maybe not in the next months but the next season or in two or three years.”
Earlier on Monday, Garde had admitted any late deals would not have been his first choice having failed to land the likes of Loïc Rémy and Mathieu Debuchy, who joined Bordeaux late on deadline day.
He also personally spoke to Doumbia to try to convince him to join Villa, who are bottom of the Premier League and visit West Ham on Tuesday."

A drama-free, shock-free window. Arsène Wenger wanted cover in central midfield, a player with the capacity to play the defensive role and he got Mohamed Elneny, who looks like a smart signing. He did not want anyone else, and so he did not get anyone else. End of story. The return of injured players pleases the manager more. David Hytner

It has been a miserable January in the market for Villa. Rémi Garde’s side are 10 points adrift of safety and have failed to sign a single player during the window. They had tracked the Ivorian forward Seydou Doumbia before his loan move from Roma to Newcastle, while deals for Loïc Rémy, Mathieu Debuchy and Wahbi Khazri never materialised. James Riach

While the Argentinian winger Juan Iturbe still looks like a rabbit in the headlights at times, Benik Afobe, the club’s record signing from Wolves, has settled quickly, scoring two goals in as many matches. Lewis Grabban, who returned to Bournemouth after an 18-month hiatus at Norwich, is popular with team-mates but will need time to convince he is worth an inflated £7m fee second time around. Eddie Howe certainly now has enough firepower at his disposal for the final straight, though. Ben Fisher

The window ended up feeling like a clearing of the decks. Ramires’ departure for a hefty fee will help financially in the summer if players on Champions League contracts have not secured Champions League football. But the arrivals of Pato and Miazga hardly had the pulses racing, and some of the club’s younger players might surely have merited an opportunity instead. Dominic Fifield
Crystal Palace
Ins Emmanuel Adebayor (free)
Outs Jonny Williams (MK Dons, loan), Jack Hunt (Sheffield Wednesday, £1.2m), Jake Gray (Hartlepool, loan), Jerome Binom-Williams (Leyton Orient, loan)
The window was largely one of frustration, with Palace’s interest in the likes of Islam Slimani and Khouma Babacar put on hold by their current clubs’ valuations. Instead, they secured Emmanuel Adebayor, who has played 17 minutes of Premier League football in a year, in the hope he retains an appetite to flourish in the English game. A risk? Perhaps not on a short-term, incentivised deal. DF

Roberto Martínez wanted to trim his squad but after banking £8.5m for Steven Naismith, allowing Aiden McGeady to leave on loan and missing out on Sam Byram, he brought forward interest in Oumar Niasse and made the Lokomotiv Moscow striker one of the biggest transfers of the January window. The Senegal international provides another option to a team and manager in urgent need of a revival, while another promising forward, Shani Tarashaj, was secured ahead of a summer arrival.

The coup of Leicester’s transfer window, arguably, is the capacity to Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez. Still, attack has been a priority – their pursuit of a new striker has been determined but difficult. The new recruits, Demarai Gray and Daniel Amartey, add depth and ability for the run-in and beyond. Amy Lawrence
Liverpool

Outs Marko Grujic (Red Star Belgrade, loan); Ryan Fulton (Portsmouth, loan); Allan Rodrigues de Souza (Sint Truidense, loan)
Jürgen Klopp’s first transfer window as Liverpool manager was frustrated by Shakhtar Donetsk’s €70m valuation of Alex Teixeira and their insistence the Brazilian forward will not be sold until the summer. Interest in Schalke defender Joel Matip was also put on hold until the end of the season when the Cameroon international will be a free agent. There was success on Marko Grujic, however, with Liverpool beating Chelsea and Internazionale to a deal for Red Star Belgrade’s highly-rated teenage playmaker. AH

Outs Anthony Caceres (Melbourne City, loan), Patrick Roberts (Celtic, loan), George Evans (Reading, undisc.), Shay Facey (Rotherham United, loan), Ian Lawlor (Bury, loan), Bruno Zuculini (AEK Athens, loan)
Made the signing of the window on deadline day (albeit not a player) when they announced Pep Guardiola would take over as their new manager. In regard to more traditional business they have made no new signings when at least one central defender would have been welcome, given Vincent Kompany’s ongoing injury problems and the unreliable form of Eliaquim Mangala, Nicolás Otamendi and Martin Demichelis. Jamie Jackson
Manchester United
Ins Adnan Januzaj (Borussia Dortmund, recalled from loan)
Outs Victor Valdés (Standard Liège, loan), Ben Pearson (Preston North End, undisc.), Liam Grimshaw (Preston North End, undisc.), Dean Henderson (Stockport County, loan), Kieran O’Hara (Morecambe, loan)
Considering Louis van Gaal’s travails this season Manchester United’s stumbling campaign could have been kick-started by one or two headline signings – but there were none. So the manager’s challenge now is to try and shepherd the players he has to secure a top-three finish and/or claim the FA Cup. If he does this it would constitute progress but whether it would save his job is a whole other debate. JJ
Newcastle United

Outs Kyle Cameron (York City, loan), Mike Williamson (Wolves, undisc.), Lubo Satka (York City, loan), Florian Thauvin (Marseille, loan), Gael Bigirimana (Coventry City, loan), Shane Ferguson (Millwall, undisc.)
High in the European spending charts but very low in the Premier League. And despite splashing all that cash the squad is still not properly balanced. At least the midfield – a big source of lots of problems – has been refreshed with Jonjo Shelvey’s arrival a coup but major chinks in the defensive armour remain, while the attacking solution looks a bit of a temporary fix. Will Newcastle come to regret not signing Charlie Austin when they could have done? Or not buying Davide Santon back from Internazionale? Louise Taylor

Outs Lewis Grabban (Bournemouth, £7m,), Gary Hooper (Sheff Weds, undisc.), Jamar Loza (Southend, loan), Elliott Bennett (Blackburn, undisc.), Jake Kean (Colchester, loan), James Maddison (Coventry, loan)
With his side two points above the bottom three, Alex Neil equalled Norwich’s transfer record by signing Steven Naismith for £8.5m and the former Everton forward scored on his debut against Liverpool, but that deal was offset by the £7m sale of Lewis Grabban to Bournemouth. Having conceded 43 goals, Norwich also made defensive additions, signing Ivo Pinto from Dinamo Zagreb and Timm Klose from Wolfsburg. The 19-year-old midfielder James Maddison, a last-gasp signing from Coventry who will spend the rest of the season back on loan with the League One club, was highly coveted by big clubs and his addition could be a coup. Jacob Steinberg
Southampton
Ins Charlie Austin (Queens Park Rangers, £4m)
Outs Steven Caulker (QPR, loan ended), Sam McQueen (Southend, loan), Ryan Seager (Crewe Alexandra, loan), Gastón Ramírez (Middesbrough, loan)
A positive window. The priority was to ensure that the predators did not lure away any of the club’s stars, chiefly Sadio Mané and Victor Wanyama and, also, to sign a centre-forward, so it was mission accomplished. There was not too much noise in the end around Mané or Wanyama while Charlie Austin was a snip at £4m. DH

Mark Hughes, after realising that Stoke would not be able to sign Saido Berahino from West Bromwich Albion, put all his transfer eggs into one basket with the arrival of Giannelli Imbula from Porto. His strategy paid dividends half an hour before the 11pm deadline, the highly-rated 23-year-old midfielder completing a club record deal worth £18.3m. The Belgian-born Frenchman joined Porto in 2013, becoming the most expensive player to join a Portuguese club. Marcus Christenson

A slightly scattergun window which has raised more questions than answers on Wearside. Wahbi Khazri, Sunderland’s £9m Tunisia international, playmaking, buy from Bordeaux, is supposed to have much in common with Mesut Özil. Can his undoubted talent keep Sunderland up? Or will his infamous bad temper undermine things? Is Lamine Koné, the new French £5m centre-half, any good? Only time will tell. LT

Outs Gerhard Tremmel (Werder Bremen, loan), Jonjo Shelvey (Newcastle United, £12m), Franck Tabanou (St Etienne, loan), Éder (Lille, loan), Daniel Alfei (Mansfield, loan)
The most significant arrival was the Italian striker Alberto Paloschi, the Chievo forward who agreed a three-and-a-half-year deal with the club, having previously worked with coach Francesco Guidolin at Parma. Swansea did, though, allow Jonjo Shelvey to leave for Newcastle for £12m, while Leroy Fer was a late loan addition from Championship side QPR. JR

Tottenham are not historically associated with keeping their powder dry in the market but the Mauricio Pochettino era has been underpinned by calmness and precision. If there is nobody that he really wants, he is quite happy to sit tight. The belief he has in his players is admirable and galvanising. The reliance upon Harry Kane has some fans rather more nervous.

Watford’s league position meant they had no need to throw money around in January. They have, nevertheless, thrown money around, breaking their transfer record twice – phrases involving leopards and spots spring to mind – despite several failed pursuits. Still, the arrivals are obvious upgrades and Nordin Amrabat, who simultaneously offers pace, natural width and cover at centre-forward – all of which had previously been lacking – could be a key signing.

Tony Pulis spent more time criticising the existence of the window – “a circus” and “a frenzy” – than taking advantage of it. The club have been consistent in their disdain for the whole thing, and have now paid one transfer fee in the last four Januaries combined. A couple of midfielders arrived on loan, and after much frenzied speculation Saido Berahino, as promised, stayed put. SB

West Ham were satisfied with their business, beating Everton to the signing of Sam Byram from Leeds United, completing a loan deal for Fenerbahce’s Emmanuel Emenike and selling Mauro Zárate to Fiorentina. Byram looks promising at right-back and Emenike, capped 37 times by Nigeria, bolsters Slaven Bilic’s attacking options. Nikica Jelavic could move to China once Andy Carroll and Diafra Sakho regain fitness. JS"

When Phany made it back to her home in Cambodia, she thought the worst was over. Like an increasing number of young women lured from garment factories on the promise of better work and brighter horizons in China, she ended up sold to a stranger and trapped in a life of abuse as one of Cambodia’s trafficked brides.
After months of sexual assault and domestic servitude, Phany escaped. What she never expected was that when she returned to Cambodia she would be treated as an outcast, her life still plagued by the horrors she had lived through.
Every year, dozens of Cambodian women are trafficked to China and sold as brides. Although there is no official data available, one Cambodian human rights group, Adhoc, says it received 35 new cases last year. Foreign ministry spokesman Chum Sounry says that in 2015 the Cambodian government facilitated the return of 85 trafficked brides who had managed to reach a Cambodian consulate. Many others who are unaccounted for are thought to be trapped and unable to return home.

“You can be sure that for every woman who escapes her captivity in China and returns to Cambodia, there are dozens more that never make it out,” says Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division.
China’s former one-child policy and the preference for male children created such skewed sex ratios that some families are unable to find local women for their sons to marry. Poor villages in Cambodia have been increasingly seen by traffickers as a source of potential brides.
They offer young women and their families – whose employment options often range little further than working in garment factories – decent work, better pay and more opportunities in China.
Phany, now 29, worked for six months as a poorly paid seamstress in a local factory. She decided to travel to China with her 20-year-old sister after her cousin introduced her to a Chinese couple who said they could offer her more lucrative factory work.
When they arrived in Shanghai they were met by a Cambodian man who said he was arranging work for them. The next day, the sisters were sold to two men who came to buy wives. One of the men paid cash for Phany and took her away, telling her that he was her new husband. They later registered their marriage, though Phany has never seen the documents.
Phany’s life became a cycle of physical, sexual and mental abuse as she carried out chores under the watchful eye of her husband and his mother.
Unable to communicate through speech, her husband would rely on gestures to give orders, often becoming aggressive if they weren’t obeyed.
“Sometimes even if there wasn’t any problem he’d attack me,” she says, as she mimicked her husband pulling at her hair and kicking her. She says she was frequently raped.
In her six months in China, Phany tried to escape three times. The third time her husband caught her, he hit her repeatedly in the stomach before finally letting her go.
Borrowing money from her parents, she returned to Cambodia. “I felt so happy. It was like being born again,” she says.
Yet when she returned to her community, she was treated as an outcast and blamed for the abuse that she’d suffered. “They didn’t want to talk to me any more,” she says, describing how her family had been torn apart by her experience.
Phany eventually left her village and went to work in Phnom Penh, where she says she can live a more anonymous life.
“I used to not want to get to know anybody because I didn’t want to admit what happened to me,” she says. “Whenever I go back to my village I feel so ashamed. If the people around me wouldn’t look down on me I would want to move back home.”
People who have been trafficked are legally entitled to support services but, with the government focusing on the prosecution of traffickers, this rarely materialises.
“It’s a rule for the government to support victims who have returned but actually [there is] no support,” says Chhan Sokunthea, head of the women and children’s division at Adhoc, which last year helped more than a dozen trafficked women to return home.

Sokunthea says the women who make it back are plagued with shame. They need counselling and recovery programmes but none exist. Many of the survivors supported by Adhoc refuse to seek legal action because of a reluctance to go public with what happened to them and a lack of faith in Cambodia’s justice system. Those who do try to seek justice are often let down.
A number of cases have made it to the court in recent years, but prosecutions are entirely of low-level brokers. Khieu Sopheak, spokesman for the ministry of the interior, says the people heading the trafficking gangs are “protected and many are not in Cambodia”.
Nary*, 22, who returned to her home in northern Cambodia in September after four years as a trafficked bride in China, hasn’t spoken to anyone in her community about her marriage.

Unlike Phany, Nary knew she would have to marry to stay in China, but had no idea of the life that awaited her.
“Not only my husband had sex with me but also his father and his relatives. In my first month I was just a housewife but after three months everything changed,” she says. “Everybody came to have sex with me any time they needed to.”
She says that if anyone discovered what happened to her she would be cast out of her community. “If any men know that I was married there, they won’t love me. I try to bury my past because it makes me so angry when I think about it or even when I hear anyone mention China.”
For Phany, pretending that her life in China didn’t exist is the only way she knows to survive. “I think about it but I try not to do that too much. I’m worried that if I do I’ll make myself ill,” she says.
“I have never forgotten what happened there. I still remember even though I want to forget. I try to keep my background to myself so I can change my life, but I don’t know what my future holds yet.”

The Australian stationery chain Typo has inadvertently waded into one of the world’s thorniest political conflicts, pulling a line of globes that named Palestine but omitted to label Israel.
The design choice, which saw Israel and 12 other countries represented by a number on the map, corresponding to a legend at the base of the globe, prompted threats of boycott and charges of anti-Semitism by supporters of the Jewish state.
The decision to halt production of the globes led to similar threats by Palestine advocates.
Issues with the original design were first pointed out on 21 January by a flurry of customers on the store’s Facebook page, including one who asked why Typo was selling a globe “that has wiped Israel from the face of the earth”.
Typo said Israel’s label was not on its globe ‘purely because there wasn’t enough space to include the name’. Photograph: Facebook
Typo said in response the design – a Mercator projection from around 1860 – was “an official map from an international body that has been approved for export” and Israel’s label had been omitted “purely because there wasn’t enough space to include the name”.
Two hours later the chain said it had “decided to remove the globes from sale in-store and online and will halt all future production”.
This decision in turn drew complaints from supporters of Palestine, who have peppered the store’s social media accounts with complaints and threats of boycott.
The ensuing anger bled over into otherwise uncontroversial posts on the company’s Facebook page, including one advertising a travel bag with the tagline, “I just took the road less travelled ... And now I’m lost!”
Among the replies were: “Could you be lost because you don’t know how to use a map. Use the correct one with Palestine and it will help!”
“The road less travelled is one that DOESN’T bow down to Zionist sentiment,” another user said.
(The map also omitted the former Yugoslavian republic of Macedonia, prompting one user to ask: “What is your political agenda Typo?”)
The company, part of the Cotton On Group, tried to stem the damage on Monday, writing on its Facebook page that new globes would be manufactured labelling every country.
“Typo is not removing any country from the globe. We made the decision to recall the current globes from sale as we are sourcing new artwork from our supplier that has every country marked on it but with no need for a key. All countries will remain on the map, the key will not,” it said.
“We never intended to offend anyone with this product.”
Among other errors the map labelled the Caspian Sea twice and misspelled the name of the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan."

A booklet they’ve published online tries to steer citizens away from recurrent pitfalls, especially as elections near
As a student and political activist in Iran, Abbas Hakimzadeh was jailed three times between 2007 and 2010. He survived physical and psychological abuse, enduring torture for up to 15 hours a day.
Suspecting a fourth arrest was imminent, in 2010 Hakimzadeh fled across the border to Turkey. The Iranian authorities had confiscated his travel documents, and Hakimzadeh took the risk of being shot by border guards to avoid yet another stint in prison.
Still, the ordeal he faced over five years ago pales in comparison to what currently awaits activists and journalists who fall into the clutches of Iran’s justice system, he says. Since the unrests of 2009, the Islamic republic expanded its use of legal tools, including capital punishment, to silence dissidents.
“The stakes are much higher now,” says Hakimzadeh. “In my time, the price you paid for activism was prison. But since the Green Movement, this price has gone up.”

One example is the charge of moharebeh, or ‘waging war against God’, which carries the death penalty. Iranian authorities have expanded the scope of its definition from ‘armed war against the state’ and ‘heresy’ to include ‘working to undermine the Islamic establishment’ and ‘cooperating with foreign agents or entities’. This allows Iranian officials to adjust the meaning of moharebeh to apply to anything from an angry post on Facebook or Twitter to participating in a spontaneous protest rally.
Hakimzadeh believes there are steps activists in Iran can take to better protect themselves, both inside and outside prison walls. He belongs to a group of over a dozen activists who used their hard-earned personal experiences to create a 19-chapter booklet in Farsi and English titled Safe Activism: Reducing the Risks and Impact of Arrest.
Designed to teach activists and journalists how to avoid careless behaviors that could endanger them and those around them, the booklet, now online, also offers guidelines on what to do in case of arrest and how to mitigate the consequences of incarceration.
Mahdieh Javid, who left Iran in her early teens, played a crucial role in writing the booklet. Through her work with activists who left Iran between 2009 and 2010, Mahdieh came into contact with activists based in Iran and made an alarming discovery.
“We realized that many instances of arrest could have been avoided by taking a few simple measures,” she says of her motivation for spearheading the project. “These issues are not talked about or sufficiently discussed. Many of the mistakes are repeated.”
These basic safety measures are highlighted in the first chapters of the ‘Safe Activism’ booklet. Readers are reminded to take precautions before meeting with other activists and not communicate important information over the phone. They are advised to keep sensitive documents as well as identification papers and travel documents at a safe place outside their residence, and to clear their homes of illegal items like drugs, alcohol and banned media.
Mehdi Aminizadeh, another activist who contributed to the project, says his family sent him books from his home library during one of his four stints in prison, without realizing one of them was contraband. Possession of that banned book was later added to his charges.
The guide also devotes a section to digital security. Readers are advised to memorize phone numbers, addresses and other sensitive information instead of recording them. The booklet recommends using a different email address for activism-related exchanges, and preventing the recovery of deleted files by using software like File Shredder.
Looking back, Hakimzadeh says one of his biggest mistakes was writing an email to his girlfriend with instructions on what to do if he was detained. “I don’t know whether I had kept the file on my computer or deleted it and they managed to recover it, but my interrogators knew about it and used it against me.”
Keeping insanity at bay
Activists have no real way of telling when and if they will be arrested or how serious their punishment will be. The arrest strategies employed by Iranian officials also differ. Some arrests are quick and predictable while others come as a surprise as authorities take time to ‘gather information and get to know the person better.’
“For others, they prepare a scenario and wait for certain things to transpire before playing out that scenario...They let the fruit ripen first and then pluck it,” says Hakimzadeh.
The booklet gives readers insight into what to expect during arrest and prison admission, as well as tactics commonly used by interrogators: threatening physical harm and arresting the subject’s family members, employing physical and psychological torture, sexual assault, as well as performing random acts of kindness.
Readers are also advised to not incriminate others when ‘confessing’. In written confessions, the authors recommend giving vague answers and including the interrogator’s questions in their statements. They advise detainees to write what is in their best interest as opposed to what they told the interrogator. To prevent prosecutors from using the confession as evidence against them in a later case, the detainees should number and date all pages. They should also prevent additions by crossing out all blank spaces. Detainees may also write illegibly and scratch out words to make their confessions inadmissible in court.
Preparing activists for solitary confinement, a common method used to break detainees, is perhaps one of the most significant undertakings of the guide. Hakimzadeh, who spent a total of 190 days in solitary, describes it as a vacuum that felt like death.
“I haven’t experienced death but I think this is how it must feel. It is very sudden and unexpected. In an instant, you are cut off from everyone and everything,” he says. “You can’t do trivial things that were once normal and you took for granted like opening a door, looking at yourself in the mirror, or checking the time on your cellphone.”
As time went by, exercise, meditation, positive thoughts and cleaning his cell, among other things, helped Hakimzadeh keep insanity at bay.
“I had a Quran and a prayer book in my cell and I would study them and take notes with the pen and paper I had found and managed to hide,” he says. “Having writing material was illegal there. I would think about my notes and have discussions about them with myself. I would talk to myself. I would walk in my cell for hours.”
The Safe Activism booklet is not the first of its kind, but its writers believe that it is more current on the methods used by Iranian authorities. Compiled by a large group of activists whose ordeals of persecution and incarceration are recent, the booklet incorporates the voices of student activists, women’s rights activists and the Green Movement as well as other groups.
“Some of the items were new even to me, for instance I knew what happens to political and student activists in section 209 [of Tehran’s Evin Prison], but I didn’t know about what happens to prisoners in other cities like Sanandaj or Ahvaz or to religious minorities. This booklet includes their experiences too,” says Hakimzadeh.
While the intended audience of the booklet are activists in Iran, its online nature also gives Islamic republic authorities access to its volume of information. However, the writers of Safe Activism are not concerned that revealing the methods used to persecute activists will result in a change of tactics.
Reading the booklet could lead Iranian officials to take a “smarter approach”, but Hakimzadeh says it will not change the fact that once a “person knows the basics of what will happen there, it will help them adapt.”
“At the very least,” adds one of the contributors who asked to remain unnamed, “it lets them know they are not alone. Others have gone through this ordeal in the past, and some of those people are safe now.”

Clare Short, Labour international development secretary until 2003, and Andrew Mitchell, aid secretary in David Cameron’s first government, made their appeal as the Syrian peace talks in Geneva heard calls for the sieges to be lifted and for aid convoys to be given unfettered access.
The top United Nations human rights official, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, speaking at a briefing in Geneva, said the starvation of Syrian civilians was a potential war crime and crime against humanity that should be prosecuted and not covered by any amnesty linked to ending the conflict.

Starvation as a tactic of war is likely to be a central discussion T Thursday’s Syria aid conference in London, jointly hosted by David Cameron and Germany’s Angela Merkel.
Short and Mitchell said the introduction of safe havens, notably around Idlib in the north and Derra in the south, must urgently return to the agenda. “We must insist the that Syrians, driven from their homes and terrified, are protected,” they said in a joint statement.
“The international community is guilty of a grotesque lack of action. The authority of the United Nations is being flouted and grossly undermined by this paralysis and failure,” they added.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mitchell said there had been a lull in the discussion about safe havens due to the Russian intervention. “The political track is taking a very long time and safe havens run and policed by the United Nations are required,” he said.
Short and Mitchell have just returned from a visit to refugee camps on the Turkish border of Syria, where they saw British charities drive into Syria with flour for bakeries.
Mitchell said Europe was likely to face more refugees seeking asylum in the near future unless a solution was found. “Fifty families are being displaced every hour, often bombed and gunned out of their homes,” he said. “We have seen just 4% of those displaced coming to Europe and obviously the European press has reacted to that.”
He said as many as 14 areas were under siege, cutting off 3 million Syrians. All those areas are running out of food and risk becoming like Madaya, the town close to Damascus where residents’ descriptions of starvation attracted global attention.
Mitchell said the London conference must ensure the refugee camps on the border were fully funded so that the World Food Programme did not have to cut its supplies, as it did last year. Short and Mitchell have claimed these cuts are intolerable since they have reduced rations in camps to meet 50 of their basic needs.

Madeleine Moon, the Labour MP who is a member of the defence select committee, said safe havens were a wonderful idea in principle, but in practice there was no point establishing them unless they were actually going to be safe.
She said such safety was unobtainable because President Bashar al-Assad and the Russians controlled the air and the ground, and had surface-to-air missiles that could take down any coalition forces seeking to enforce a safe zone. “We cannot create something because we want it to exist when we don’t have the capability to enforce it,” Moon said.
She said Russia, and not the coalition, was responsible for the majority of civilian deaths inside Syria, and that the coalition was not involved in carpet bombing.
Short claimed this was backwards, rigid thinking, and pointed out the UK had voted for UN security council resolutions backing the lifting of sieges and unfettered humanitarian access. She said that would require the UK to adopt a more flexible approach to the conflict. “The military have got to reconsider their tactics and not just bomb and bomb,” she said.
Jo Cox, the Labour MP with whom Mitchell has worked on Syria, wrote to Cameron on Sunday night saying she was saddened that he “has lost focus on the political dimensions of the crisis and that the EU referendum has diverted both officials and ministers who could otherwise have been focused on addressing one of the worst humanitarian crises of our time”.
She urged him not to subcontract UK diplomacy to America. She said: “The US view of the crisis is not one and the same as either the UK’s or the EU’s. We cannot therefore contract out our foreign policy.
“Specifically, while the US is focused on nothing beyond a ceasefire, we could be playing a critical role in pushing for early confidence-building measures, such as an end to the brutal sieges, the use of barrel bombs and cluster munitions.
“Broad coalitions of Syrian groups insist that the peace talks will not be credible in their eyes – and so will not last – if they don’t see progress on these measures, all of which have been previously agreed unanimously at the UN security council, including by Russia. The UK should be strongly insisting that these not be up for renegotiation.”"

Saudi Arabia’s pledge to investigate allegations of civilian casualties caused by its bombing campaign in Yemen has been dismissed as inadequate by human rights groups, which insist an independent inquiry is needed to settle mounting controversy and provide accountability for possible war crimes.
The Saudi-led Arab coalition fighting in Yemen said on Sunday that it regretted civilian deaths, which it said were “unintended”, and it was now investigating the allegations and improving its targeting mechanisms. About 6,000 people have been killed since the start of Operation Decisive Storm in March last year.
The coalition command said it had formed “an independent team of experts in international humanitarian law and weapons to assess … incidents and investigate the rules of engagement”. The objective was to reach “conclusions, lessons learned, recommendations and measures that should be taken” to spare civilians.
The statement came in response to sharp criticism of the coalition by UN experts fuelling growing international concern about the human cost of the war. The US and Britain, which both supply weapons to the Saudis and back the intervention in Yemen, have been pressing for a response from Riyadh.

Amnesty International said coalition members had a duty to investigate allegations of violations by their forces. “But there must be an international, independent, impartial commission of inquiry to look into all reported violations and abuses by all parties to the conflict, to establish the facts and identify the perpetrators … with a view to ensuring that those responsible are held accountable,” it said.
Human Rights Watch said its concerns would only be addressed if it had “guarantees that the committee will be taking real measures towards ensuring accountability”. The Campaign to Stop Bombing Yemen said a UN inquiry was necessary.
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), whose facilities in Yemen have been hit three times, called the establishment of a ‎committee “a step in the right direction”. But independent and impartial international investigations were also needed, it said.
Last November Philip Hammond, the UK foreign secretary, said the Saudis’ denials that there had been breaches of international humanitarian law were not enough and called for “proper investigations”.
The Saudis repeatedly advertise the backing they are getting from the US and Britain. “Experts from the United States … [will] work on extensive reports and develop operating mechanisms, together with the British side,” said the coalition spokesman, Brig Gen Ahmed Asseri, adding that the advisers had held a workshop in recent days at coalition headquarters.
Amnesty said the UK “should immediately suspend export licences for all further arms bound for the Saudi war machine pending the outcome of its own review of UK arms to Saudi Arabia”.
A report by UN experts seen by the Guardian last week said the coalition had carried out 119 sorties that violated humanitarian law, and called for an international commission of inquiry.
The Saudi-led alliance is seeking to prevent Houthi rebel fighters, whom it sees as a proxy of Iran, from taking complete control of Yemen. The Houthis deny any backing from Tehran and accuse the coalition of launching a war of aggression.
Asseri said a hotline had been set up with MSF to protect its facilities. He acknowledged that the coalition was responsible for the bombing of an MSF hospital in northern Yemen on 27 October, which it denied at the time, telling reporters that planes had targeted Houthi fighters nearby.
MSF has requested that the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission investigate the attack. The body has a mandate to investigate violations of international humanitarian law under the Geneva conventions.
“MSF cannot rely solely on internal investigations by one or another party to the conflict in establishing the events … involving our medical facilities,” the medical aid organisation said on Monday. “An independent, impartial inquiry that is distanced from the interests of those at war must be carried out. We need to understand what happened and why, for the safety of our teams and our patients, in Yemen and in all conflicts.”
Belkis Wille, Yemen researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the statement from Riyadh “does not sound like it includes what the coalition is obliged to do under the laws of war: transparently investigate those attacks that led to violations, hold accountable those who perpetrated the violation, and compensate the victims.”"
World music|Music blog|Syria|Refugees|Middle East and North Africa|blogposts,2016-02-01T17:23:39,guardian,Alex Petropoulos,Homesick and heartsick residents of Jordan’s vast Zaatari refugee camp sing of their sadness at exile,https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/feb/01/syrian-refugees-reveal-heartache-through-music-recording-earth-zaatari,Syrian refugees reveal their heartache through music,en,culture|music,,"Just a few kilometres east of Mafraq, Jordan, the Zaatari refugee camp stretches over five sq km towards the Syrian border. Originally established as a temporary settlement in July 2012 for Syrians fleeing the civil war, Zaatari is now home to an estimated 79,000 people, and has seen over 350,000 refugees pass through.
In November, the film-makers Olly Burton and Alex Blogg of the organisation Recording Earth made a series of short documentaries about Zaatari’s residents, telling their stories and following the narrative of the conflict through music. After recording and speaking to several individuals, Burton and Blogg quickly discovered that almost all of the songs and poems shared a common theme: Syria, and a longing for home.
Recording Earth’s Refugee Music project follows the stories of individuals such as singer Mohamad Isa Almaziodi (above), who left his terminally ill father behind in Syria; poet Raed Al Hussein, who once spent six months in a Syrian prison because of a poem he wrote; and former policeman Ziad Qaem Al Masri, who picked up the rebab after moving to the camp in order to hold on to a small piece of his home country’s tradition.
“The artists really go somewhere else when singing, and when they think about Syria,” Burton says. “When Mohamad started crying, you felt like he was there [with] his dad in Syria. And then it’s as if he suddenly snaps out of it and realises he’s not there – he’s in a caravan in a refugee camp.”

The songs and poetry of Zaatari’s residents offer a way to cope with life in the camp and their homesickness. Despite the cloud of uncertainty about what the future holds for them and their children, they are doing all they can to hold on to their traditions and memories of home, hoping that one day they’ll be able to return to restore these songs and poems to their native country."

A Virginia teenager whose body was found over the weekend overcame serious health problems as a young girl and was then bullied at her school and online before her death, her mother said.

Virginia Tech student David Eisenhauer, 18, has been charged with first-degree murder and abduction in connection with the death of 13-year-old Nicole Madison Lovell, whose body was found on Saturday in North Carolina, police said. Another Virginia Tech student, Natalie Keepers, 19, faces charges of improper disposal of a body and accessory after the fact in the commission of a felony.
Nicole’s mother, Tammy Weeks, told the Roanoke Times that her daughter survived a liver transplant, MRSA and lymphoma when she was five.
Nicole didn’t like going to school because girls called her fat and talked about the scars from her transplant, Weeks said. Lovell often cried to stay home from school, her mother said.
“It got so bad I wouldn’t send her,” Weeks said, but the bullying continued on social media.
Lovell loved pandas and wanted to be on American Idol when she got older, Weeks said.
Davy Draper, who said he was a close family friend of the Lovells and knew the teen most of her life, called her an energetic and outspoken girl who got along with everyone.
“She was an awesome little girl. She was an angel here on earth, and she’s an angel now,” Draper said on Sunday.
Eisenhauer and Keepers were being held without bond at the Montgomery County jail. The students appeared in court for the first time on Monday morning.
Eisenhauer arrived early and was not seen by reporters. He has retained a court-appointed attorney.
Keepers appeared in court in an orange jumpsuit and shackles. She said she understood the charges against her and has retained the services of an attorney.
Neither entered a plea. They are both being held on bond and are due back in court on 28 March.
Police said they had evidence showing Eisenhauer and Lovell knew each other before she disappeared.
“Eisenhauer used this relationship to his advantage to abduct the 13-year-old and then kill her. Keepers helped Eisenhauer dispose of Nicole’s body,” Blacksburg police said in a statement. But police did not comment further on any motive.
A state police search and recovery team searched a pond on Sunday and Monday on the Virginia Tech campus. State police spokeswoman Corinne Geller would not say what officials were trying to find.
Authorities said they located Lovell’s remains in Surry County, North Carolina, just over the Virginia border.
Montgomery County commonwealth’s attorney Mary Pettitt told local news station WDBJ7 that an autopsy on Lovell was scheduled for Monday, but the results are not expected until just before the next court date in the case.
Blacksburg police chief Anthony Wilson told the Roanoke Times that Eisenhauer had not confessed to involvement in Lovell’s death and did not give police information that led to the discovery of her body.
The girl had been missing since last week. Her family says she disappeared after pushing a dresser in front of her bedroom door and climbing out a window. Lovell’s family members did not immediately return messages seeking comment.
Eisenhauer was a standout track and field athlete in high school, who was named Boys Indoor Track Performer of the Year by the Baltimore Sun in March. The Sun said Eisenhauer had moved to Columbia from Yakima, Washington, for his junior year and quickly became a star. His coach told the newspaper Eisenhauer was “the best-kept secret in Maryland”.
Virginia Tech said on its website that Eisenhauer was a freshman engineering major at the school and that hundreds of students and researchers had assisted in the search for Lovell. The school said in a statement on Saturday that he had been suspended from the university.
A number listed for Eisenhauer’s parents was busy on Sunday. A message left at Keepers’ home in Laurel, Maryland, was not immediately returned. Officials at the county jail where the two are being held would not say whether either suspect has a lawyer."

Vampire Weekend played a benefit in Iowa on Saturday (the band were joined by Sanders and his wife Jane for a rendition of Woody Guthrie’s This Land is Your Land), and others will appear at a Feel the Bern fundraiser in Los Angeles on Friday. Headliners will be the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who – presumably after a long band meeting – collectively declared in favour of the Vermont senator last September. “Bernie Sanders is the only remotely reasonable candidate for president of the United States,” Flea had already tweeted in August. (The Chili Peppers, of course, being longstanding experts on what’s reasonable.)

Indeed, looking down the list of official Sanders backers, despite the presence of progressive rappers such as Killer Mike and Lil B, there seems to be a prevailing 80s and 90s flavour, suggesting he appeals more to the middle-aged indie crowd than to millennials. There’s Lou Barlow of Dinosaur Jr, Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys, Belinda Carlisle of the Go-Go’s, Jon Fishman of Phish, Billy Gould of Faith No More, Chris Shiflett of the Foo Fighters, Maureen Herman of Babes in Toyland and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth. Going further back, the faint sound of barrel-scraping gets louder as David Crosby, Mike Watt of the Stooges and Donovan (Mellow Yellow guy, British not American) are also included.
Strangely, there’s no sign on the list of Roger Waters (also British), who endorsed Sanders last October, or Simon and Garfunkel, who gave permission for their song America to be used on a campaign ad. This did “not imply an endorsement from Simon and Garfunkel”, a spokesperson said at the time, but Art Garfunkel later told CNN that he and Simon were both asked about the song. “It’s the moment when you say, Am I a Bernie guy? Yes, I am.” Billy Bragg supports Sanders, too, but doesn’t make the website either.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pharrell Williams is behind Clinton. Photograph: Steve Jennings/Getty Images
If the US were a rockocracy (one small mercy to be thanked, there), then the 2016 election would already be effectively over, with Hillary and Bill back in the White House. That’s because Clinton has all the blue-chip endorsements going, including – deep breath – Kanye West, Beyoncé, Pharrell Williams, Katie Perry, Christina Aguilera, Burt Bacharach, Tony Bennett, Jon Bon Jovi, Mariah Carey, Cher, Kelly Clarkson, Ellie Goulding, Ice-T, Ja Rule, Elton John, Quincy Jones, Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, Janelle Monae, Morrissey, Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Sting, Barbra Streisand, James Taylor, Usher, will.i.am and Stevie Wonder. Which ought to do it.
The trouble with having such famous fans, however, is that they do tend to be asked their opinions about things, and their opinions are often fairly odd. For instance, 50 Cent spoke surprisingly warmly of Hillary to the Daily Beast, before explaining that he mainly admired her for tolerating Bill’s infidelity. “The lust factor out of convenience,” he said. “Things happen at points, and her seeing past that made her human to me.” Uh-huh.
Or here’s Pharrell explaining to GQ why he supports Hillary, and why she’s sure to win: “Everywhere you go in this country, you have red and blue. You got the Democrats; you got the Republicans … You know what else is red and blue? Blood. Blood is blue in your body until air hits it, and then it turns red. That means there’s unity.” There’s quite a bit more along these lines, but to sum up Pharrell’s position: the two main parties are represented by two colours that are the same as the two colours of blood (which is actually never blue), which means that, even though half of America hates Hillary, it is destined for a woman president. Infectious pop hits: definitely. Thinking about things: maybe not.
However, perhaps most worrying for some would be Hillary’s relationship with Kanye – which apparently includes taking his political ambitions so seriously that she would consider him as a possible running mate in 2016. “I’ve told Kanye that I think he might want to wait. Cause I’ll be running for re-election,” she has said. “I might want to give him some additional experience so he’s got, on all the other things he’s done on his resumé, he’s got some kind of envoy role or something he could point to ... I would not rule out anybody for vice president.” Rockocracy might be closer than we thought.
Artists for Trump isn’t a very large constituency, for some reason. (Although he does have the hulk vote sewn up, with endorsements from both Hulk Hogan, who has volunteered as running mate, and Lou “The Incredible Hulk” Ferrigno – “He’s a fabulous guy. I hope he goes all the way.”)
Among the few musicians who have declared for Trump are the country music legend Loretta Lynn (“I just think he’s the only one who’s going to turn this country around”), hard-rock gun enthusiast Ted Nugent (“Donald Trump is the hellraiser America has needed for a very long time”) and Mr Las Vegas Wayne Newton (“Number one, he tells the truth. Number two, he’s been where most of these guys want to be, in terms of riding on his own plane”). In truth, Newton seems to be such an all-round positive guy that he’ll endorse just about anything red. Jeb Bush would also “make an incredible president”, he says. Plus he “loves” both Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson.

Confusingly, Trump also has the “support” of Azealia Banks, whose reasoning, as she explained in a series of tweets today, goes as follows. “Just because Hilary [sic] Clinton and Bernie sanders say nice things about minorities doesn’t mean they actually mean them … I only trust this country to be what it is: full of shit. takes shit to know shit so we may as well put a piece of shit in the White House … In conclusion, I think Donald trump is evil like America is evil and in order for America to keep up with itself it needs him.” Which is nice, but hard to leverage.
Always the mould-breaker, Trump is actually more of a specialist in counter-endorsements. Only this week, Adele has insisted that she did not give permission for him to play Rolling in the Deep or Skyfall at his rallies. Trump also got a letter from Steve Tyler’s lawyers after he used Aerosmith’s Dream On which, the letter complained, “gives a false impression that [Tyler] is connected with or endorses Mr Trump’s presidential bid”. Michael Stipe of REM was even more forthright, if less lawyerly, last autumn, when he refused Trump permission to use his music with the words, “Go fuck yourselves, the lot of you – you sad, attention-grabbing, power-hungry little men. Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign.”

Now we’re running low on fuel. Rand Paul has the support of Jonathan Davis and Phil Labonte of Korn and All That Remains respectively. Ben Carson has Kid Rock. Jeb Bush has country singer Toby Keith. But it appears that no notable musicians at all would like to see a President Christie, Cruz, Fiorina, Kasich or Perry. Unlike Trump, few of the other Republicans have even been thought worth banning from anybody’s music. “I’m like the only rightie in the leftie industry,” Kid Rock plaintively told Fox News.
Which leaves Marco Rubio, who has perhaps the best chance of beating Trump to the nomination – and will hope to be powered there by the backing of Johnny Van Zant, the lead singer of Lynyrd Skynyrd (current lineup), as well as Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds, the successful R&B singer and producer whose nickname rather unfortunately describes Rubio himself. It remains to be seen whether this will be enough to distract attention from the support he is also getting from the pornographic actor Jenna Jameson, whose eye for a winner picked out Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. “I’m very looking forward to a Republican being back in office,” she said at the time. “When you’re rich, you want a Republican in office.”"
US military|Islamic State|Iraq|Syria|Republicans|Donald Trump|news,2016-02-01T19:32:03,guardian,Spencer Ackerman,Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland said ‘indiscriminate’ bombing suggested by Donald Trump and Ted Cruz goes against army values: ‘It matters how you win’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/01/us-military-iraq-syria-sean-macfarland-republican-carpet-bomb-isis,US military commander in Iraq and Syria rejects GOP pledges to 'carpet-bomb' Isis,en,world|US,,"Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland said ‘indiscriminate’ bombing suggested by Donald Trump and Ted Cruz goes against army values: ‘It matters how you win’
The US military commander in charge of the Iraq-Syria war has tacitly rebuked pledges by leading Republican presidential contenders to “carpet-bomb” the Islamic State.
Though army Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland did not call out Donald Trump and Ted Cruz by name, he rejected what he called “indiscriminate” bombing as illegal, immoral and un-American.
“We are bound by the laws of armed conflict and at the end of the day it doesn’t only matter whether or not you win, it matters how you win,” MacFarland told reporters on Monday.
As Iowans were set to caucus in the first presidential contest of 2016, MacFarland said “indiscriminate bombing, where we don’t care if we’re killing innocents or combatants, is just inconsistent with our values”, despite two major White House contenders adopting it as a central proposal against Isis.
Trump, the Republican frontrunner, told an Iowa crowd he would “bomb the shit out of ’em … there would be nothing left”. His closest rival, the Texas senator Ted Cruz, has repeatedly vowed to pursue the “fundamentally different military strategy” of carpet-bombing Isis without “apology”, most recently in last Thursday’s debate.
“We will carpet-bomb [Isis] into oblivion,” Cruz said in Iowa last month.
MacFarland said the proposal contravened military professionalism and likened it to “what the Russians have been accused of doing in parts of north-west Syria”.
Russia’s authoritarian president, Vladimir Putin, and Trump have traded praise. MacFarland characterized Putin’s airstrikes on behalf of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad as a divergent objective from the US goal of defeating Isis.
Though MacFarland said his goal was to get home to his grandchildren, it is likely he will remain in command through the presidential election, and will in any case largely shape the war the next president will inherit.
Unlike previous military officials and even the man who appointed him last fall, defense secretary Ashton Carter, MacFarland pointedly declined to provide reporters with specifics about the changing nature of the war in Iraq and Syria, particularly over key details such as prospective US troop increases or the recently expanded role of special operations forces.
“I’d like the enemy to find out for the first time when the area around them is going up in smoke,” MacFarland said.
Yet MacFarland telegraphed that he was looking at proposing “additional troops” for the fight, particularly as he examines military capabilities that the current effort lacks. He characterized the war as closer to the beginning than the end, stating that the “beginning of the end” will come when Isis loses its Syrian capital, Raqqa.
MacFarland said the December recapture of Ramadi from Isis represented a “turning point” in proving the prowess of the long-sponsored Iraqi military. A forthcoming push to retake Mosul, Isis’s power base in Iraq and the country’s second-largest city, could also include US attack helicopters, he said, in an intensification of US air support for what is expected to be a large operation this year.
Yet MacFarlane indicated that ridding Iraq of Isis completely is an unlikely goal. Defeating Isis “as currently configured” in Iraq – a conventional force that holds territory and fights along front lines – would not rule out its persistence as a “low-grade insurgency [or] terrorist organization”, even if Iraqi forces backed by the US and Iran reclaim the areas Isis currently occupies.
As an army colonel in 2006 in Ramadi, MacFarland made his reputation by embracing a nascent split between Sunni tribal chiefs and the faction of al-Qaida that would, years later, transform into Isis. A decision by MacFarland, later adopted by higher US command, to align with Iraqi fighters he and other commanders had previously understood to be enemies became the genesis of the “Awakening”, a realignment of allegiances that aided the Iraq war’s greatest period of tactical success.
But what the military has regarded as a turning point in the Iraq war has proven difficult to emulate. A program inspired by the Awakening, the Afghan Local Police, has yielded instead turf battles within US-sponsored Afghan ministries and allegations of human-rights violations. Around the time MacFarland took control of the war – an October 2015 move to consolidate a sprawling effort under a single officer – the Pentagon abandoned an expensive initiative to build a Sunni Syrian fighting force and opted instead to sponsor existing Kurdish and Sunni militant forces.
While MacFarland and other US military officials have characterized the airstrikes against Isis as among the most precise in the history of warfare, the US has recently begun conceding that it has mistakenly killed and wounded civilians.
The private organization Airwars, which attempts to track the civilian impact of the bombing, has tallied allegations of between 2,029 and 2,635 noncombatants mistakenly killed in nearly 18 months of bombings, two orders of magnitude beyond what US military officials have confirmed.
MacFarlane rejected criticism that recent attacks on Mosul facilities where Isis keeps its cash risked targeting civilians.
“Is an enemy banker a combatant or not? Just because he doesn’t have an AK[-47] leaned up against a teller window, he’s still a bad guy, right?” MacFarland said, stating that the US airstrikes occur during times the US assesses will minimize loss of life.
Hawkish legislators and presidential candidates have proposed loosening the rules under which US pilots can open fire on targets, claiming that the US hamstrings itself in target selection out of fear of inflicting additional death on civilians in areas where Isis operates.
MacFarland neither stated that he felt unreasonably constricted nor indicated sympathy to the critique, instead portraying distinctions between military from civilian targets as a battlefield advantage.
“Right now we have the moral high ground, and I think that’s where we need to stay,” he said."
New York|LGBT rights|Christianity|Religion|news,2016-02-01T19:44:12,guardian,Amanda Holpuch,Atlah Worldwide church to be sold at auction over unpaid bills and tax with LGBT homeless charity and gay-friendly church seeking to purchase building,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/01/lgbt-groups-raise-funds-buy-anti-gay-harlem-church-facing-foreclosure,LGBT groups raise funds to buy anti-gay Harlem church facing foreclosure,en,world|US,,"LGBT rights groups have raised more than $118,000 to purchase a New York City church led by a pastor known for his anti-gay rhetoric.
A state judge ordered Atlah Worldwide church to be sold in public auction this month because the Harlem church owes more than $1m to creditors for unpaid bills and tax liens.
LGBT advocacy groups quickly mobilized to raise funds to purchase the space after years of participating in demonstrations against Atlah, which posted anti-gay messages on its sign, including: “Harlem is a sodomite free zone” and “Jesus would stone homos”.
More than $118,000 had been raised by Monday afternoon for the two Harlem-based LGBT groups hoping to purchase the church building.
The LGBT-friendly Rivers of Living Water church hopes it can turn the building into a permanent site for the parish and the Ali Forney Center is hoping to use the space to expand housing for homeless LGBT youth.
“I think it would represent a real healing of a terrible wound that’s been in that neighborhood,” said Carl Siciliano, founder and executive director of the Ali Forney Center.
Since launching a fundraising campaign around 5pm on Friday, the Ali Forney Center had raised more than half of its $200,000 goal by Monday afternoon.
The center houses 107 homeless youth and has a drop-in area three blocks from Atlah.
Its program in Harlem provides 50,000 meals annually to homeless LGBT youth and the center also offers services such as medical and mental healthcare.
Siciliano said that every night the center turns away about 170 to 200 youth who need shelter.
“Every bed we are able to obtain is precious,” said Siciliano. “And I have to say, it is a very rare thing for a local neighborhood [to ask] for a homeless youth housing program.”
The initial $200,000 raised will be bolstered by support from the government, major donors and foundations.
Siciliano hopes that the building’s myriad zoning restrictions will drive away other potential buyers. The rapidly gentrifying neighborhood has experienced a real estate squeeze that tends to benefit the wealthiest property buyers.
If the center cannot buy the building, it plans to use the funds it has raised for its homeless LGBT youth programs at other sites.
These plans are a far cry from the desires of Atlah’s Rev David Manning, who became pastor of the church in 1981.
In November 2015, he stood outside his building yelling hate speech at demonstrators affiliated with the Ali Forney Center.
Manning said that the church does not owe money and that his lawyer is involved in ongoing discussions with the court. “I think it’s just an uninformed move by people trying to do a land grab,” Manning said.
He said he did not care that more than $100,000 had been raised for LGBT groups hoping to purchase the building.
“I don’t care what they do,” Manning said. “People do a lot of things.”
The other Harlem LGBT group hoping to make a bid at the 24 February auction is the Rivers of Living Water church. The church’s pastor, Vanessa Brown, said that she hopes the building can provide a permanent home for her church, which was founded in Harlem nine years ago.
“We believe divine justice can transform a place of hatred in our community to a place of love and life. That is the reason we are seeking the funds to purchase the building,” Brown said. “We are asking for political, financial and social support.”
More than 200 people are a part of the congregation, which attracts primarily LGBT people and their families and currently holds services in the basement of a Methodist church. It has raised nearly $18,000 on its Gofundme page as of Monday afternoon.
Brown said that by having a permanent space, the church could continue and extend programming to include literacy efforts, after-school arts classes, GED lessons and transitional housing.
Brown said that even if they cannot purchases the building, Atlah leaving the neighborhood would be significant for her and her congregation. Brown said: “We would know we are safe again.”"

Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, the two Republican candidates each vying to prove themselves the most viable alternative to Donald Trump, have been locked in a heated battle over immigration in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses on Monday night.
Marco Rubio seeks clear pathway on immigration – for himself Read more
Speaking to the Guardian as voting in the key state was about to begin, Rubio maintained that his record on immigration had been clear whereas Cruz, he said, had misled the American public.
“Ted Cruz presents and portrays himself as this purist who’s never supported anything that even comes close to legalization [for undocumented immigrants] when in fact he did,” the Florida senator said after a town hall in Cedar Rapids on Sunday.
“He helped design George W Bush’s legalization policy as a candidate, he openly and repeatedly talked about reaching a compromise on people that are here illegally … He said he wanted to see immigration reform pass, he wanted to see people come out of the shadows. And now he’s pretending that that never happened and it did.
“It’s not about immigration. It’s about the calculation that he thinks he can say and do anything and people aren’t going to notice,” Rubio said.
Rubio did not enter the final stretch of the Iowa caucus at the top of the polls, but nonetheless his rivals felt sufficiently threatened to spend at least $20m on ads attacking him – largely focused on his record on immigration. At present he stands third in polling behind Cruz and frontrunner Donald Trump in Iowa, and third in the national Republican race.
Cruz’s closing argument across Iowa drew heavily on Rubio’s support in 2013 for a comprehensive bill to make the case that “a vote for Marco Rubio is a vote for amnesty”.
“I’ve been clear,” Rubio told the Guardian. “I don’t think we can fix this comprehensively, I’ve been very clear about that. That was tried. It failed, for good reason, because Americans don’t trust the federal government and we’re going to have to do this in stages beginning with enforcement.”

Immigration has been at the forefront of the Republican primary, spurred by a grassroots anger that has helped send Trump and Cruz to the top of the polls.
The Texas senator has adopted an especially hardline position, shifting his stance on work permits for foreign workers and birthright citizenship. While he maintains he never supported legalization for undocumented immigrants, and was simply using procedural tactics to derail Rubio’s bill in 2013, it was not until December that Cruz explicitly ruled out providing the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US with a path to legal status.
In last week’s Republican debate, Cruz sought to once more shift the focus back toward Rubio’s prior efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform. He was joined, somewhat unexpectedly, by former Florida governor Jeb Bush – who charged that Rubio “cut and ran” from his own bill when faced with resistance from conservatives.
Asked by the Guardian to respond to the criticism, Rubio said his legislation – known as the “Gang of Eight” after the bipartisan group of senators who worked on it – was no longer relevant.
“The bill has no chance of passing. There is no support for a path that does not first involve bringing illegal immigration under control. Period,” Rubio said.
Ted Cruz denies immigration policy flip-flop in defense against Marco Rubio Read more
“Anyone who continues to insist, like Jeb does, that it needs to be done comprehensively and through one massive piece of legislation is not being realistic. They’re not being serious about it.
“There is no way to solve this issue until first we bring illegal immigration under control and prove to the American people that it’s under control,” he added.
Voters have nonetheless taken notice of the barrage of attack ads against Rubio, particularly some that recycle clips of him advocating a path to citizenship during the 2013 debate. At town halls here over the past week, there were several instances in which potential caucus-goers said they were confused about where, precisely, he now stood on so-called “amnesty”.
Rubio pushed back emphatically, insisting he has never been, and will never be, for “blanket amnesty”. He also drew on his roots, as the son of Cuban immigrants and from a predominantly immigrant community in West Miami, to cast himself as speaking with particular authority on the issue.
“As the son and grandson of immigrants, I can say that enforcing immigration laws is not anti-immigrant,” he told the hundreds who packed his town halls and rallies throughout Iowa.
As for his current position, Rubio has said he continues to support eventually providing green cards to law-abiding undocumented immigrants – only after the border is secure, legal immigration is reformed, and after they first receive work permits for 10 years. He has also reframed the immigration debate as one of national security, pointing to the threat posed by the Islamic State and the potential infiltration of terrorists across US borders.
As president, Rubio told the Guardian, his plan for undocumented immigrants would be shaped by the will of the American public, a debate he emphasized would only occur once illegal immigration was under control.
“I don’t think the American people are going to support anything until border security is first in place. After that, we’ll see what people are willing to support,” Rubio said.
“I’ve outlined a way forward. We’ll see if people support it. We’re not going to force it on them.”"

Iowa caucus day: Palin praises Trump as 'he who will be the next president' – campaign live Read more
A Guardian analysis of the final campaign disclosures released on the eve of Iowa’s caucuses shows the Cruz campaign, banking on a win in the first-in-the-nation voting state, significantly outspent his main Republican rivals in targeting potential voters online during the final quarter of 2015.
During this period, Cruz surged in the polls and emerged as a frontrunner from the crowded Republican race in Iowa as attack ads rained down on Donald Trump and Marco Rubio. Trump went on to regain his lead ahead of Monday night’s Iowa caucuses. Over the weekend, the Cruz campaign came under fire separately for mailing accusations of a “voting violation” to individual Iowa residents amid what privacy and transparency experts said had amounted to “a military escalation” of data-driven campaigning.
The federally mandated release of expenditure filings on Sunday shows a crescendo of spending as well-funded campaigns and their allied Super Pacs bolster their digital firepower by pouring record amounts of cash into the so-called “micro-targeting” of voters across social media with increasingly personal ads.
Cruz has deepened his ties to the little-known data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, directing around 20% of overall spending during the reporting period to the data scientists embedded at Cruz’s campaign headquarters in Houston.
Ted Cruz campaign using firm that harvested data on millions of unwitting Facebook users Read more
In December, the Guardian uncovered long-standing privacy and ethical issues around the way Cambridge Analytica’s parent company had acquired detailed psychological data on tens of millions of voters using data harvested from largely unwitting Facebook users.
Cambridge Analytica is understood to be financed by hedge-fund magnate Robert Mercer, who is also the leading individual donor to the Cruz campaign. Last year, the influential but reclusive Wall Street executive channeled $11m into the pro-Cruz Super Pac Keep the Promise I.

The Mercer-backed group is part of a cluster of pro-Cruz Super Pacs, which all use a variation of the name Keep the Promise. In recent weeks Cambridge Analytica appears to have played a key role in a digital advertising blitzkrieg, funded by the web of Super Pacs that support Cruz.
According to so-called “independent expenditure” reports, the Mercer-backed group, Keep the Promise I, has paid out almost $350,000 to Cambridge Analytica since mid-November. The records state the firm provided unspecified “media” in order to support Cruz and attack rival candidates Marco Rubio and Donald Trump.
While the Keep the Promise Super Pacs officially exist as separate entities, the groups work together and keep in touch with weekly strategy calls, according to the Washington Post. In the two weeks leading up to the Iowa caucus, the Super Pacs spent $1.1m on online campaigning and advertising.
The involvement with Cambridge Analytica by both the Cruz campaign and an allied Super Pac appears to contrast with a decision made by Jeb Bush’s campaign last year to halt plans which would have seen the candidate share a data analytics company with the pro-Bush group, Right to Rise.
In October, the Associated Press reported the Bush campaign halted the plan over concerns around potentially crossing the line of coordination. Even after the 2010 US supreme court decision that allowed unlimited outside funding, candidates’ campaigns and Super Pacs are prohibited from coordinating political activities and must maintain separate operations.
Richard Skinner, a policy analyst at transparency watchdog the Sunlight Foundation, said shared vendors are traditionally one of the “red flags” when detecting coordination between a campaign and an outside group.
Asked to examine the relationships stemming from Cruz’s data-centric operations, Skinner said the campaign and Super Pac are not simply sharing a company that manufacturers campaign T-shirts, but a company that is providing an essential service to both.
“The data is clearly pretty central to the campaign and presumably central to what the Super Pac is doing,” Skinner said in a phone interview on Monday, adding that Mercer had taken an “unusually active role for a major donor” in Cruz campaign operations.
In an email, Cambridge Analytica’s CEO Alexander Nix said his company treats compliance with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) rules as an “utmost priority”. He added: “With this in mind we have strict fire-walling procedures in place wherein the staff, data, and systems for each campaign are physically and electronically separated.”
A spokesman for Mercer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Big data, bigger spending on Trump hats
The latest federal disclosures suggest the Cruz campaign is relying heavily on Cambridge Analytica as a pillar of his campaign operation, spending $3,055,990.95 from October through December. “We have a very successful relationship,” Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told the Guardian in December, adding that information was acquired legally. “They’re a great company, they provide us great data, and it helps us be highly effective in communicating with our voters.” (Tyler and a campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this article.)

So far, other Republican candidates have spent considerably less on comparable data firms and digital-focused political consultants.
Of the $1.3m Rubio’s campaign spent during the final quarter of 2015 on digital campaigning – or what on the campaign trail is known as “digital, data and analytics” – the largest sum of around $460,000 went to Optimus Consulting, a relatively small data analytics firm which has an established relationship with the Florida senator’s campaign.
Meanwhile, Trump spent more on hats than he did on data analytics. In early November, his campaign paid $235,000 to L2 Political, a minor Washington-based voter targeting and analytics outfit which focuses on political clients.
Overall, Bush’s campaign spent around $800,000 on the digital campaign trail, over half of which went to Deep Root Analytics, a firm co-founded by former Mitt Romney data scientist Alex Lundry, who also serves as the Bush campaign’s director of analytics.
‘Violations’ – and a war for targeting
In the final hours ahead of the 2016 campaign’s first vote, which was set to begin in Iowa on Monday evening, the Cruz campaign was condemned from all sides for applying its newfound targeting prowess to old-fashioned voter outreach.
On Friday, it emerged the campaign had sent official-looking direct mail to some voters accusing them of a “voting violation”. The mailer, which did not involve Cambridge Analytica, used so-called “social pressure” techniques and calculated a fake score for each target voter, along with their neighbors, according to their participation in recent elections.
Responding to the controversy on Saturday night, Cruz was bullish. “I apologize to nobody for using every tool we can to encourage Iowa voters to come out and vote,” he told a press conference in Sioux City.
Experts in modern-day election outreach said the mail episode, taken together with big-money online profiling, showed the Cruz campaign’s expertise in using psychological methods to pressure individuals into voting.
David Peterson, a professor of political science at Iowa State University, appreciated that Cruz is trying to run a “smart and advanced” campaign by drawing on psychological techniques and academic research, but claimed the mailer had crossed a line.
“We know candidates and campaigns mislead people all the time about themselves and their opponents,” he said. “But it’s the misleading about private citizens who have no connection to any of this that strikes me as particularly galling, and that’s what’s a step too far.”

In recent years, a wide body of academic research has found “social pressure” is often highly effective in increasing turnout – the key blockage in the senator’s path to overtaking Trump’s poll lead at the caucuses.
“Just by gently signalling that people are watching you has been shown to increase participation,” said Eitan Hersh, a political scientist at Yale University who focuses on voter attitudes and campaign strategy.
Joseph Turow, a leading data privacy expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said that as the 2016 primary votes arrived, political analysts had seen an “upward trajectory” in data-driven campaigns targeting voters across devices and in specific moments.
“Essentially it’s a military escalation because every group and every competitor is trying to outdo the other,” he said in an interview ahead of Sunday’s federally mandated filings."

Sheriff’s captain Jeff Hallock also said the inmates were picked up by an accomplice shortly after they escaped on 22 January from Central Men’s jail in Orange County.
Later that day, inmate Hossein Nayeri held a gun on a taxi driver, who spent two nights with the fugitives in southern California before they stole a van and drove north, Hallock said.
Nayeri and inmate Bac Duong then had a physical fight in an Alameda hotel room over whether to kill the taxi driver, he said.
Duong and the taxi driver returned the next day to Santa Ana, where Duong later surrendered.
Earlier in the day, prosecutors said a teacher who was arrested in connection with the escape would be released due to insufficient evidence to charge her with any crime.
Prosecutors have requested that the county sheriff’s department conduct further investigation of Nooshafarin Ravaghi, 44, who teaches English as a second language to jail inmates, district attorney Tony Rackauckas said.
Rackauckas also announced the arrest of Lac Ba Nguyen on suspicion of sending into prison an article useful for an escape. Prosecutors did not elaborate on the article or say how it might have been used.
Nguyen provided the inmates with “things that facilitated the escape” and picked them up shortly after they escaped, Hallock said.
Nayeri, 37, Jonathan Tieu, 20, and Bac Duong, 43, escaped Central Men’s jail. Duong turned himself in Friday and the other two were arrested in San Francisco on Saturday.
The sheriff’s department had initially said Ravaghi and Nayeri, who was in her class, had exchanged letters of a personal nature. Rackauckas said Monday that the letters appear to have been written by Nayeri, not Ravaghi.
The district attorney said Ravaghi was continuing to cooperate and that steps were being taken to ensure she remains in the jurisdiction after her release.
Nguyen is due in court 22 February. It’s not immediately known if he has an attorney.
With all three inmates back in custody, authorities were examining how they carried out the jailbreak and what they did during their week on the run.
The men sawed, crawled and climbed their way out of the maximum-security jail and used a rope made of bedsheets to rappel four stories to the ground.
The trio then spent several days in Rosemead, a Los Angeles suburb, where they held the cab driver at gunpoint, Hallock said.
The three then drove to northern California in a stolen van and the taxi, taking the driver with them, he said.
Duong surrendered on Friday at an auto repair shop in Santa Ana just a few miles from the jail.
Nayeri and Tieu were arrested Saturday after a civilian flagged down officers near San Francisco’s Golden Gate park.
The three inmates, who did not know each other before being housed in the Orange County jail, were awaiting trial on charges involving violent crimes.
Built in 1968, the jail that housed the men holds about 900 inmates. It was the first breakout from the facility in nearly 30 years."

The Iowa caucuses are perhaps the most important yet mysterious contest in American politics. The concept of an election is familiar to everyone – but by its very name, a caucus sounds different and archaic. However, give or take a few wrinkles, the Iowa caucuses are simply another election, held on a cold winter’s night in the Hawkeye State. But those wrinkles do matter quite a bit.

Is it the same process for Democrats and Republicans?
No. Whereas Republicans have a relatively straightforward process, in which they cast secret ballots in their precinct caucuses, it’s far more complex for Democrats.
Republicans
Republicans have a secret ballot. Voters take a piece of paper and mark the name of the candidate whom they support. These votes get counted in each precinct and reported to the state party.
These totals are supposed to be reflected in the final Republican delegation to the national convention. Rules implemented after Ron Paul finished third on caucus night in 2012 but eventually controlled Iowa’s delegation are supposed to enforce this.
The totals reported on caucus night are simply normal vote tallies as in any other election.
That is not the case with Democrats.
Democrats
Democratic caucuses are quite undemocratic. Each precinct is apportioned a number of delegates based on Democratic turnout in the past two elections. It’s like an electoral college at a micro level.
This means turnout doesn’t matter. If a precinct is supposed to have five delegates to the county convention, it doesn’t matter if eight people show up to the Democratic caucus or 800. The precinct is still only getting five delegates. (Precincts elect people to the county convention, which elects people to the district convention, which elects people to the state convention.)
After attendees show up to a Democratic caucus, they are divided into preference groups based on candidates whom they support. Bernie Sanders supporters will stand in one area, Hillary Clinton supporters in another. Once everyone is separated, there is a first count of how many supporters each candidate has.
To be viable in each precinct, a candidate usually needs to receive the support of 15% of those who attend, although in some small rural precincts, the threshold is higher.
If a candidate’s support is under that threshold, his or her supporters need to induce others to join their group in order to reach 15%. If they are unsuccessful in doing so, their candidate is not considered viable and they can either go home or support a candidate who is viable instead. There is then a second count of supporters for each candidate and, from those totals, delegates are assigned.
This means that if Democratic candidates are polling under 15% statewide on caucus night, they could significantly underperform compared to their polling.
Key demographic groups
Despite this socially conservative slant, the key group in Iowa on the Republican side in 2016 will be more moderate “country club” Republicans. With Donald Trump and Ted Cruz appealing to those conservative voters looking for red meat, if moderate Republicans in the eastern part of the state coalesce behind one establishment candidate – Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush or Chris Christie – it could make this a three-person primary, with evangelical, conservative and establishment camps each emerging with a viable contender.
On the Democratic side, students will be the key demographic to watch. This will be the first Iowa caucus in over a decade that has taken place when colleges and universities are in session. If Bernie Sanders can successfully organize and turn out young people across the state, it could give him an edge in several key counties across the state.
Turnout will also be important on the Republican side, as many of the voters most attracted to Trump’s candidacy are new to the political process. The higher the turnout, the better for Trump. In contrast, overall turnout is a mixed indicator for the Democratic primary. While Sanders is also hoping to turn out a number of voters new to the political process, an increase in turnout doesn’t necessarily bode well for him. After all, while Clinton may have lost the state in 2008, she still vastly surpassed her vote goals and likely turned out more people than every other Democratic candidate in the history of the caucuses besides Obama."

Six people have been charged following police raids on homes and businesses across Melbourne that netted an alleged crime boss.
A 51-year-old Tullamarine man and nine others were arrested overnight at properties in Carlton, Tullamarine, Balwyn North and St Kilda.
The Tullamarine man, who police allege was the syndicate’s kingpin, was due to appear in the Melbourne magistrates court on Monday.
He was charged with trafficking and possessing methylamphetamine and cocaine, possessing a hand gun and ammunition, and dealing property suspected of being proceeds of crime. Five others were charged following the raids.
Residents near the Carlton housing commission flats said police used chainsaws to break through heavily fortified apartments.
Molla Ozusen said police wrongly knocked on his door just before 8pm on Sunday night.
They demanded he open his door and they checked his apartment before apologising when they found nothing, he said.
“I said, you come to the wrong door,” Ozusen said on Monday.

Molly Meldrum’s close friend and former personal assistant says the music guru is receiving the best care possible following a fall.
There were concerns the 73-year-old’s health had deteriorated since the accident in Thailand with reports on Monday that Meldrum’s brother was making attempts to fly him home.
Meldrum, who just celebrated his birthday, slipped while getting out of a cab at a hotel in Bangkok last month.
He has been in excruciating pain since the fall and now faces spinal surgery.
Entertainment reporter Peter Ford tweeted on Monday that plans were in place to bring Meldrum back to Australia for treatment.
“Molly’s brother has flown to be with him. Possibility he may be flown out on medivac flight home,” Ford tweeted.
Ford also told Melbourne radio station 3AW that Molly’s condition is “a lot more serious” than first thought.
But Meldrum’s long-time friend Michael Gudinski said the reports that he would be flown home were incorrect, saying the whole thing had been “blown out of proportion”.
“He’s not flying back to Australia at this stage,” the Mushroom Music boss said.
But Gudinski admitted Meldrum’s situation was not good.
“He’s in hospital. He’s in pain. He’s broken a few bones which in his situation is not a good thing because he’s had trouble before,” Gudinski said on Monday.
In 2011, Meldrum took a nasty fall at his Richmond home while putting up Christmas decorations. He suffered a fractured skull and spent months in rehabilitation following the near fatal accident.
Yael Cohn, Meldrum’s former personal assistant, was unable to confirm any details on his condition.
“I know that he’s safe and well and that’s the most important thing at the moment,” Cohn said. “I’m confident at least he’s been well looked after.
“That’s the most important thing to me as a person who cares for him, as a friend, that he’s in the best possible care and I’ve been assured of that.”

Australia’s major political parties have declared millions of dollars in political donations, with major donors including property developers, resource tycoons, unions and industry lobby groups.
The Liberal party declared a total of $75.9m in donations and other receipts in the 2014-15 financial year, the Labor party $65.8m, the National party $11m and the Greens $9m. Clive Palmer’s Palmer United party declared a total of $10m.
The single-largest donation was a sum of $5,947,720 from Queensland Nickel to the Palmer United party, which is likely to fuel further debate about the handling of the Townsville-based business before it went into administration last month.
The annual release of data by the Australian Electoral Commission on Monday shows two other Palmer-owned businesses, Mineralogy and Palmer Coolum Resort, donated $3,628,345 and $191,113 to his party, respectively.
The Liberal party and Labor party also received large personal donations from wealthy and prominent individuals.
Charles and Sylvia Bass made two separate donations totalling $200,000 to the Liberal party. Charles Bass is the cofounder of mining group Aquila Resources and has previously appeared on the BRW rich list.
One of the more mysterious donations is from Melbourne man Jiandong Huang, who gave $100,000 to the Liberal party. Huang is a relatively unknown figure and appears to have never made a donation before.
Searches reveal that Huang is a director of more than 20 companies, some of which have been involved in property development deals in Melbourne. Huang’s company Australia Star Tower Development has been reported as the ultimate holding company of a development of the Kinnears Rope Factory in Footscray.
Mining and resources chairman Paul Marks appears to be the largest personal donor to the Liberal party. He made three donations totalling $340,000. Marks is the executive director of Nimrod Resources. Former prime minister Tony Abbott faced criticism for chartering an RAAF plane to fly to Melbourne, where he attended a birthday party for Marks.
The Ever Bright Group also made a $200,000 donation to the Liberal party. Last year the man behind the company, Zi Chung Wang, made the largest contribution to the Australian Labor party.
The Labor party benefited from a $150,000 donation from tech entrepreneur Sean Tomlinson. Tomlinson also gave another $110,000 to the party, which the party has classified as “subscription” in their declaration. Tomlinson reportedly owns 20% of software group Revel Systems.
Significant donors to the Labor party also included the unions United Voice, which donated a total of $179,950, and the Shop Distributive & Allied Employees’ Association South Australia, which donated a total of $190,000.
Tobacco company Philip Morris Limited declared two donations totalling $10,780 to the National Party.
Gambling interests paid out handsomely over the reporting period, including the Australian Hotels Association (AHA), which handed $230,000 to Victoria’s Coalition parties and $150,000 to Labor’s Victorian branch. Most of the donations were made before the state’s November 2014 election.
Clubs NSW gave $15,000 to New South Wales Labor party, while James Packer’s Crown Resorts gave nearly $40,000 to Victorian Labor and another $22,000 to the party’s West Australian branch.
The Victorian Liberal party has also declared cash from Crown, $46,000 which it lists as an “other receipt”. Also listed as “other” was $22,000 from the AHA to Labor and $29,600 from Clubs NSW to the NSW Liberal party. Both the AHA and Clubs NSW gave Labor funds for “subscriptions”: $27,500 from the hotels and $66,000 from the clubs.
Parties must specifically declare amounts of more than $12,800 received from an individual or organisation in a single financial year, which the AEC then publishes online.
While the AEC calls any sum of money given to a political party a donation, parties are able to classify amounts as “donation” or “other receipt” at their own discretion, where other receipt may refer to anything from financial returns from investments or payment for membership fees or event tickets in lieu of donations.
The Greens have long been calling for an overhaul of the nation’s donations system and Labor supports changes such as a reduction in the disclosure threshold to $1,000.
The major parties came close to an agreement in the last parliament to increase taxpayer-provided funding by $1 a vote and to reduce thresholds for declaring donations to $5,000, but Abbott retreated after a party room backlash. Currently, public funding of $2.62 per vote is provided to parties and candidates garnering more than 4% of the primary vote.
There could be a fresh push for changes soon. The parliamentary joint standing committee on electoral matters is conducting an inquiry into the financing of political parties, including public funding and private donations. It is due to report back in March on how the Australia’s laws compare with those of similar countries.
The leader of the Greens, Richard Di Natale, said the system was broken because vested interests were “throwing around big wads of cash” but voters had to wait up to 18 months to see the details”.
“Here we are in an election year and we could have an organisation, an international donor, seeking to influence the outcome of the election this year and we won’t know about that until after the election result is concluded,” Di Natale said. “We need major reform in this country around election donations. People are really worried about the fact that they are a corrosive influence.”"

GST (Goods and Services Tax)|Lenore Taylor on politics|Australian politics|Scott Morrison|Tax|Coalition|Health|comment,2016-02-01T02:45:41,guardian,Lenore Taylor,"Increasing the GST is a major change, but the government is struggling to articulate exactly why it needs to",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/01/scott-morrison-needs-more-than-slogans-to-sell-gst-increase-to-sceptical-voters,Scott Morrison needs more than slogans to sell GST increase to sceptical voters,en,world|australia,,"If a government is going to do something as big as increasing the GST by 50%, they should probably be clear about why they’re doing it.
The most convincing arguments for changing public policy start by defining the problem that needs to be solved and then explaining why the proposed policy is the best way to solve it.
In the case of the government’s still vague intentions on tax reform, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, says the problem is inadequate economic growth and, in particular, the impact on growth of inflation pushing wages into higher income tax brackets, so-called “bracket creep”.
While higher growth could eventually reduce the budget deficit without severe cuts to spending, government sources say they have not finalised modelling about the relative economic benefits of cuts to company taxes or cuts to personal tax rates.
GST debate: Scott Morrison backs need for option to raise tax as part of reforms Read more
Morrison talked up personal tax cuts, including on the grounds that many small business are unincorporated, but that doesn’t really explain the economic impact of consumers paying more for everything while having a bit more money to do it.
And it’s unclear whether the government is even doing any modelling on other policies that might boost growth, like spending more on education (rather than cutting the last two years of Gonski payments) or spending more on research and development, or even their own stalled plan to increase payments for childcare.
And while successive Treasury secretaries and a long line of economists have argued that bracket creep is a problem in the long term, right now Australia has historically low wages growth so, if Morrison is right and the average wage earner is about to tip into the second-highest tax bracket by the end of this year, they probably won’t be paying that extra 4.5% tax on very much of their income for quite a long time.
Meanwhile, Morrison is dismissive of arguments by Liberal and Labor state premiers that another big problem – a looming and severe crisis in health funding – should also be part of his tax calculations.
That’s just old fashioned “Labor-style” tax and spend, he says.
“The idea of raising taxes just for more spending, that’s really what Labor does; it’s something that we’re not particularly attracted to when it comes to this tax and spend,” he said when asked about the idea put forward by the NSW premier, Mike Baird, that would see the extra GST revenue cover personal and company tax cuts and – in the interim – extra payments for hospitals and schools.
“We want to see a tax system that’s growth friendly, not a tax system that is just feeding an ever-growing appetite for higher and higher spending, which is Labor’s approach.”
Except Baird’s plan actually accepts Morrison’s insistence that the tax changes cannot increase the overall tax rate.
Morrison considering two tax reform options, including $32bn GST hike Read more
It basically asks the commonwealth to spend enough to get the states through the hospitals crisis for the next four years while still delivering personal income tax cuts, at which point everyone can reassess whether the tax cuts have delivered the boost to economic growth and overall increases in revenue that the commonwealth is claiming they will.
Morrison’s response might be a negotiating tactic in this game of bluff between the commonwealth and the states.
But the fact the treasurer skirts around the whole idea of including hospitals in the tax plan makes one wonder whether his real reason is the political desire to make the “Labor is the tax and spend party” argument in the lead-up to the election.
And, even based on a judgment of the politics, this is a curious decision. Economists back the idea that bracket creep is a long-term problem but a looming funding crisis that could jeopardise services at already stretched public hospitals is probably more likely to grab the attention of the electorate. Especially when the same voters are funding their own tax cuts by paying more for goods and services.
If Morrison wants to convince a sceptical electorate that economic growth and bracket creep are the nation’s biggest problems and a GST hike is the way to fix them, he’s going to have to do better than saying that the government is for “jobs and growth” while Labor is about “tax and spend”. Voters have become sceptical of slogans."

The RSPCA says a driver has deliberately run down and killed 17 kangaroos on the outskirts of Brisbane.
The animal welfare group said it was appalled by the incident that left a 100-metre stretch of road at Wacol littered with kangaroo carcasses.

The animals were discovered on Monday morning, between a women’s prison and a nearby men’s one on Grindle Road.

The ABC’s Q&A program will be broadcast live across the country when it returns on Monday night, just one of many changes made to the panel show after an independent editorial review.
During the Christmas break the show was moved from the television division to the news division and is now answerable to the director of news, Gaven Morris.
Gaven Morris interview: 'Every member of the public has a stake in the ABC' Read more
The changes have been made to ensure the program has a wider range of topics and questioners and more diverse voices, including having more female panellists.
In line with the recommendations made in the editorial review by Ray Martin and Shaun Brown last year, the program will spend more time on the road to escape being too Sydney-centric and to allow access to more prominent women in other locations.
The routine review was ordered by the ABC board before the Zaky Mallah incident blew up last year after constant criticism from the government that the program was left-leaning.
After the former terrorism suspect asked a question on the program, the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, banned his cabinet ministers from appearing on the program and the show dominated headlined for weeks.
However, the long-awaited editorial review cleared the program of accusations that it was a leftwing lynch mob.
Martin and Brown found the program did not have a “leftwing anti-Coalition bias” and was equally a challenge to both sides of politics.
However, the report did find that women were significantly outnumbered by men and were given fewer questions and less time to speak.
A minimum of 16 of the 43 episodes this year will be broadcast from outside Sydney, from locations including Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and regional centres.
It is an expensive exercise as an entire set has to be built in each new location.

The platforms on which viewers can ask questions have been widened to include Skype, Facebook, Twitter and other social media, and detailed data about the gender balance of each program will now be available on the show’s website.
“We are always looking for new ways to make Q&A even better and involve more Australians in debate and discussion around the big issues facing our country,” said Peter McEvoy, the executive producer of Q&A.
McEvoy was given a formal warning by management last year after the Mallah furore.
Morris said the news division was happy to be able to show the program live across Australia once again.
“As Australia gears up for a fascinating federal election, Q&A’s role as a forum for public democracy has never been more vital,” he said.
Q&A was moved off ABC News 24 last year when Lateline was relaunched in an earlier time slot on the news channel.
The panel for Monday’s show consists of Australian of the Year David Morrison, senior Australian of the Year Gordian Fulde, Guardian Australia’s Indigenous affairs editor Stan Grant, young Australian of the Year finalist Manal Younus and Catherine Keenan, the creator of the Sydney Story Factory and Australian local hero for 2016. Keenan was a late replacement for the 2015 Australian of the year, domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty, who withdrew through illness."

Police in the Hunter Valley are warning that consuming synthetic drugs is akin to “a gamble with your life,” after a 17-year-old died and two men were left seriously ill after using synthetic cannabis.
An emergency department consultant and senior lecturer with the Australian National University, Dr David Caldicott, described the deaths as “a tragic deja vu”.
“It’s just bloody awful, not just for the family of this poor kid, but for the family of every kid who has every been killed by these drugs, with each new death ripping open their wounds,” he said.
Synthetic cannabis deaths show case for controlled sale of marijuana, expert says Read more
Police were called to the suburb of Rutherford in News South Wales at 8pm on Saturday, where they discovered the body of the teenager in a reserve.
While the results of a post-mortem examination were not yet available, police have since been told the teen consumed a substance branded as “Chronic” in the hours before his body was found.
On Sunday police said they were informed that two men, both aged 22, fell ill in the nearby suburb of Telarah after consuming Chronic earlier that day. While their symptoms were not life-threatening, both required medical treatment. Police searched a property in Rutherford later on Sunday where they seized an undisclosed quantity of Chronic.
Caldicott said he was seeing more young people coming through his emergency department suffering the ill effects of synthetic drugs, also known as new psychoactive substances, which are manmade substances designed to mimic the effects of other illicit drugs such as cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy.
“This is definitely something that has increased in the past 10 years, and there is now doubt the hostile prohibition approach to drugs based on ideology is directly responsible,” he said.
“By making a drug like cannabis the enemy, we have pushed the market to change to produce drugs that are completely novel, which can be ordered online and paid for by crypto-currencies and which can’t be detected by sniffer dogs.
“These drugs are marketed as natural alternatives but nothing could be further from the truth, these compounds were developed by chemists, and these drugs never existed 20 years ago before our prohibitive approach to drugs.”
The substances in synthetic cannabis differ greatly, making it hard to treat those who have severe reactions to the substances. Hundreds of distinct potential synthetic cannabinoids had now been identified and more are released frequently. As a result, doctors have no idea what patients are reacting to, what to test for, or how to treat them.
An Australian-led systematic review of adverse events arising from the use of synthetic cannabinoids published this month in the medical journal, Clinical Toxicology, found use of the substances was low in the general community at less than 1% of the population, though use was higher among students and some niche groups subject to drug testing.
Major complications from the substance included cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke, seizures, psychiatric illness including psychosis, paranoia, and self-harm and severe, prolonged vomiting. Rapid heart rate was also common.
The president of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, Dr Alex Wodak, said by legalising organic cannabis, doctors and policy makers would at least then know what substance they were dealing with. It would prevent people from turning to synthetic substances, which they wrongly perceived to be safer or legal, he said.

“We have created a problem that wasn’t there before, through our drugs policies, and now we’re trying to reduce the damage from this problem that we created,” Wodak said.
“In the United States, Colorado and Washington have already approved, taxed and regulated cannabis with favourable results, and other states are committing to doing the same. Yet Australia is not moving on this.
“Just like moonshine arose from alcohol prohibition, this is a result of our prohibitive drugs policy.”
Police are continuing their investigations.
“Police are warning anyone who is considering experimenting with illicit or synthetic drugs, no matter how they are branded or presented, to not do it,” police said in a statement.
“It’s a gamble with your life that’s just not worth taking.”

Oregon militia standoff|Oregon|news,2016-02-01T23:35:54,guardian,Sam Levin,"After Ammon Bundy called on final occupiers to leave refuge, his father sent a letter to government officials declaring armed militia would not back down",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/01/oregon-armed-militia-standoff-cliven-ammon-bundy-malheur-national-wildlife-refuge,Cliven Bundy defies son Ammon in call for Oregon militia to stand their ground,en,world|US,,"After Ammon Bundy called on final occupiers to leave refuge , his father sent a letter to government officials declaring armed militia would not back down
Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who led a standoff with the federal government in 2014, wants the protesters in Oregon to stand their ground – directly defying the message of his son, Ammon.
Days after militia leader Ammon Bundy, now in jail in Portland, Oregon, called on the final four occupiers at the Malheur national wildlife refuge to surrender and go home, the elder Bundy sent a letter to government officials declaring that the armed militia would not be backing down.
“This is notice that We the People of Harney County and also We the People of the citizens of the United States DO GIVE NOTICE THAT WE WILL RETAIN POSSESSION OF THE HARNEY COUNTY RESOURCE CENTER,” Cliven wrote in the letter, which he sent on Monday to the local sheriff, Oregon governor Kate Brown, and the White House.
The armed militia in Oregon renamed the federally protected refuge the “Harney County Resource Center” and for weeks since the occupation began said their goal was to return the public lands to the control of local people.
But since 11 people associated with the militia were arrested – and occupation spokesman LaVoy Finicum was shot and killed by state troopers – leader Ammon Bundy has called on the holdouts to end the protest.
Cliven Bundy, however, declared today that he wants the opposite to occur.
“What this is saying is that Cliven Bundy is taking control of things,” Cliven said in an interview from his ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada, on Monday afternoon. “If we don’t retain it, then we’ve lost everything that we’ve done in the last two months. We’re not gonna give up.”
He added: “This is not Ammon’s message. This is my message ... We’ve made a decision to retain it ... The feds are going to get out of there.”
The letter demands further: “Remove all federal and state policing agents out of Harney County.”

Cliven said he suspected that his imprisoned son felt pressured to urge the remaining occupiers to go home. “That’s what he said, but I never believed it. I don’t think that’s what’s in his heart. He probably got his arm twisted.”
Cliven said he has not talked to his son since he was arrested last Tuesday. Ammon, his brother Ryan, and a group of activists are facing federal felony charges for their roles in the occupation of government buildings, which began on 2 January to protest the imprisonment of two local ranchers.
Carol Bundy, Cliven’s wife, said in an interview that it was crucial the occupation persevere. “Ammon does not want bloodshed. But he wants the message to continue,” said Carol. “We’ve made a statement. We’ve made a stand. And we’d like to hold out.”
The four remaining occupiers have posted videos online saying they refused to leave unless they had assurances that they would not face charges. The four left are David Fry, a 27-year-old Ohio resident, Jeff Banta of Elko, Nevada, and husband and wife Sean and Sandy Anderson of Riggins, Idaho.
Speaking through his lawyer after his first court appearance last week, Ammon issued a statement that said: “To those who remain at the refuge, I love you. Let us take this fight from here ... Please stand down. Go home and hug your families. This fight is ours for now, in the courts.”"
New York|Africa|news,2016-02-01T00:00:12,guardian,Rupert Neate,Undercover activist posing as adviser to African minister secretly taped interactions with 13 US law firms as Obama calls for crackdown on corruption,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/31/lawyers-grey-money-undercover-video-african-minister,Undercover film shows how lawyers could ease flow of 'grey money' into US,en,world|africa,,"New York lawyers have been secretly filmed advising how an African minister could use “grey money” to buy up a Manhattan brownstone, a private jet and a luxury yacht without US authorities – or his impoverished citizens back home – ever knowing.
An undercover activist posing as an adviser to an African mining minister filmed encounters with 13 US law firms, offering a rare glimpse into how US lawyers could possibly act to facilitate the flow of dirty money into the country despite Barack Obama repeatedly demanding a crackdown on global corruption.
Almost all the lawyers offered suggestions as to how the minister could move “grey money” and “suspect funds” into the US while ensuring his identity was never disclosed. None of them made suggestions that were illegal.
One lawyer, Mark Koplik, was recorded by an undercover investigator from anti-corruption charity Global Witness as saying: “So we have to scrub it at the beginning, if we can, or scrub it at the intermediary location.”
Koplik, who boasted that US authorities “don’t send lawyers to jail because we run the country”, advised the minister could hide his identity and avoid US anti-money laundering checks by exploiting a loophole and wiring the money directly to a US law firm to avoid probing questions about the legitimacy of the funds. Global Witness said its investigator told lawyers that the minister’s money “represented payments to him for helping companies receive mining concessions in his country”.

Koplik, a managing partner of Henderson & Koplik on Manhattan’s Lexington Avenue, also advised the use of family trusts to obscure the paper trail. “The smaller ones are often more flexible and understanding and less concerned about their reputation, because they fly to a greater extent below the radar screen,” he said.
Koplik refused to comment to the Guardian. David Gendelman, a lawyer representing Koplik, refused to provide any comment because Global Witness had not provided a copy of the undercover footage. Gendelman refused to state whether Koplik denied the allegations. Neither Koplik nor any of the other lawyers secretly recorded entered into any agreement with Global Witness’s undercover activist, and none took him on as a client. Nor were any of the suggestions made by the lawyers illegal.
Another lawyer recorded was James Silkenat, a partner at Sullivan and Worcester who was president of the American Bar Association at the time of the filming last year. Silkenat explained how a complex web of ownership companies could be created “to insulate his ownership from public view”.
“Company A is owned by Company B, who is owned jointly by Company C and D, and your party owns all of or the majority of the shares of C and D,” Silkenat explained.
The undercover activist told Silkenat that the minister earned about as much as a US teacher but wanted to buy a $10m brownstone, a $20m Gulfstream private jet and a yacht that “would be at least, if you’re talking about an [Roman] Abramovich [style] yacht, this dimension would be around $200-$300m”.
Silkenat’s colleague, Hugh Finnegan, said the supposed minister would not be alone in trying to hide his identity as the real owner of the assets. “Many foreign owners just don’t want anybody to know who they are. So they set up either corporations or in some cases they set up limited liability companies, and it’s usually one or two other companies up the food chain, making it more difficult to identify [who the real owner is].”
Silkenat said companies were routinely created to hide the true owners from public scrutiny. “Lots of the big apartment buildings here, where the purchase price ranges from $30-$90m, now are done through a corporate entity to shield whoever’s buying it from public discussion.” This is not illegal.
Silkenat and Finnegan deny that they acted inappropriately and said they found the undercover activist to be “dishonest and untrustworthy” and would “under no circumstances … ever take on such a client”.
“A full recounting of our experience with [the investigator] shows we did the right things,” Silkenat and Finnegan said in a statement to the Guardian. “We participated in a preliminary meeting with someone who we reasonably believed to be a reputable attorney. We listened, we told him that there would be a need to conduct due diligence on the background and past activities of his purported client, as well as the sources of the funds his ‘client’ was seeking to invest.
“We told him that his minister’s activities must be shown to have been lawful – under both the laws of the United States and other countries – and that we would not assist with any unlawful activity, going so far as to state that we believed that we would be obligated to report any unlawful activity on the part of his client to the authorities. The legal and financial topics we discussed were basic and generic and obtainable through a Google search and are used on an everyday basis in the US to protect privacy concerns.”
They said that if the camera had followed them after the meeting it would have shown them concluding that the investigator was “disreputable and that we would not deal with him again”.
The Global Witness investigation comes as the US government prepares to begin a crackdown on corrupt foreign officials and international criminal leaders buying up multimillion-dollar Manhattan apartments with “dirty money”.
Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a branch of the Treasury, said “all-cash” buyers of high-end properties will, from March, be forced to reveal the true “beneficial owner” and would no longer be able to hide behind a string of shell companies. “We are seeking to understand the risk that corrupt foreign officials, or transnational criminals, may be using premium US real estate to secretly invest millions in dirty money,” she said.
The World Bank estimates that about $1tn is paid in bribes every year, with corruption disproportionately affecting the world’s poorest people, particularly in Africa.
The circumstances suggested by Global Witness in its undercover filming closely mirror those of Teodoro Obiang, son of the president of Equatorial Guinea, who allegedly used US lawyers to move more than $100m into the US. In 2014, he was forced to sell a massive mansion in Malibu, California, as well as a Ferrari, in a $34m settlement with US authorities as the centerpiece of the Obama administration’s Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative.
Obiang – who had commissioned plans for a luxury superyacht costing $380m, nearly three times his country’s combined health and education budgets – got to keep a Gulfstream jet and most of his $2m worth of Michael Jackson memorabilia."

The Ugandan military has detained a general who is a long-time critic of veteran leader Yoweri Museveni, in a move likely to raise tensions in the country in the weeks leading up to a presidential election.
David Sejusa, who in 2013 alleged officials were plotting to kill anyone who stood in the way of Museveni transferring power to his son, is is being detained at a military barracks in the capital Kampala and his home was surrounded by military police, his lawyer Ladislaus Rwakafuuzi said.

Museveni, who is seeking to extend his 30-year rule, is facing perhaps his toughest challenge yet ahead of the 18 February vote, which pits him against long-time opposition leader Kizza Besigye and his ally-turned-rival, Amama Mbabazi.
Rights groups have accused the government of using state security to stifle criticism and intimidate Museveni’s rivals in the weeks before to the election, charges the government denies.
Army spokesperson Ronald Kakurungu told NTV Uganda, a local television station, that Sejusa had been taken into custody in the capital Kampala early on Sunday.
“Today the deputy army commander...went to (Sujasa’s) home and arrested him and took him to Makindye,” Kakurungu said, referring to the military facility on the outskirts of Kampala.
The spokesman said Sejusa would be charged before a court martial on Tuesday but he did not elaborate on the charges.
In 2013, Sejusa fled to Britain after making allegations of plot to kill officials who opposed a plan for Museveni to hand power to his son, Kainerugaba Muhoozi, a brigadier in the Ugandan military.
He returned to Uganda the following year in what analysts said was probably a fence-mending move by Museveni to prevent cracks in the military.
Since his return, however, Sejusa has maintained his criticism of government and has given several interviews to local media, in which he has criticized the president and expressed support for the opposition.
Michael Mabikke, another of Sejusa’s lawyers, said he had been denied access to his client.
“Sejusa... has told Ugandans this is a dictatorship and I think this criticism rubbed them the wrong way,” Mabikke said."

Scores of people, including children, have been killed in a Nigerian town by Boko Haram fighters who shot at villagers and set fire to their homes in the latest deadly attack by the Islamist militant group.
The attack took place on Saturday in the village of Dalori, which lies about 12km (seven miles) from the northern city of Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram and the biggest city in Nigeria’s north-east.

Some 86 people died after Boko Haram fighters arrived in the village, initially shooting at locals from their cars before setting fire to huts with people inside. The militants also tried to storm a nearby refugee camp, housing 25,000 people.
Colonel Mustapha Anka, a spokesperson for the army, said the assailants arrived “in two cars and on motorcycles, they opened fire then set light to homes.” Three female suicide bombers who had initially tried to mingle with the villagers “were intercepted, then blew themselves up,” he said.
A survivor who hid in a tree during the attack said he watched Boko Haram fighters firebomb huts and heard the screams of children burning to death.
Scores of charred corpses and bodies ridden with bullet wounds littered the streets.
Villagers who survived the attack said they fled into the bush when the assailants entered Dalori.
“We were seated outside our home shortly after the Isha prayer when we heard gunshots and within a few minutes the invaders had arrived,” said Malam Masa Dalori, a community leader.

“They came in Golf saloon cars and began to shoot sporadically. Many people ran to the bush including myself. When we came back in the morning the entire community had been razed. At least 50 people were killed, and there are many people wounded.”
The shooting, burning and explosions from three suicide bombers continued for nearly four hours, survivor Alamin Bakura told the Associated Press. He said several of his family members were killed or wounded.
The violence continued as three female suicide bombers blew up among people who managed to flee to neighbouring Gamori village, killing many people, according to a soldier at the scene.
Troops arrived at Dalori around 8:40pm on Saturday but were unable to overcome the attackers, who were better armed, other soldiers said.

The Boko Haram fighters only retreated after reinforcements arrived with heavier weapons, they said.
On Sunday, survivors of the attack complained it had taken too long for help to arrive from nearby Maiduguri and said they feared another attack.
A total of 86 were collected by Sunday afternoon, according to Mohammed Kanar, area coordinator of the National Emergency Management Agency. Another 62 people are being treated for burns, said Abba Musa of the State Specialist Hospital in Maiduguri.
The attack was swiftly condemned by the European Union, which said it was committed to supporting regional African states in the fight against such extremist groups.
Maiduguri, about 90 miles from the southern shores of Lake Chad, has a population of 2.6 million, more than half of whom are refugees. The city has been the targeted several attacks in recent months as militants have tried to retake the city from which they were pushed three years ago.
Boko Haram has been attacking soft targets, increasingly with suicide bombers, since the military last year drove them out of towns and villages in northeastern Nigeria.
The six-year Islamic uprising has killed about 20,000 people and driven 2.5 million from their homes.

“I was 14 when my parents told me I must leave their home and go to a new place – my husband’s. The next day I left. Can you imagine? I had no idea how to keep a house or what was expected of a wife in marriage,” she says.
She went to her husband’s parents for help. By this time she had three children. “They told me I could stay there and they would feed us but only if I did not deny my husband sex when he came to visit. Because of this I had three more children.”

Eventually Bakhita’s husband abandoned her, leaving her dependent on her brother for support. “I am so unhappy because my brother forced my 15-year-old daughter to marry. I hear they treat her very badly and she is beaten. I am so sad. I tell my two youngest daughters every day I do not want this to happen to them. When they grow up my son will be responsible for them. I say to him, ‘Look at your father. Do not allow them to marry a man like him.’ My son will be my legacy.”
This is not only a promise she’s made to herself and her children, it is a commitment she has made to the entire community of Mading Kantok, the remote home of semi-nomadic cattle traders belonging to the Dinka tribe in Warrap state, South Sudan.
According to Joyce Patra, from the Organisation For Children’s Harmony, a local NGO, the only way a girl can avoid being married off early “is if her mother doesn’t disclose to the father that she has started menstruating. Girls have economic benefit attached to them because one girl can be married in exchange for 150 cows”.
Domestic violence is rife in South Sudan. The 2014 state of the world’s children report (pdf), published by the UN children’s agency, Unicef, says 79% of South Sudanese women believe a husband has the right to hit his wife.
My wedding night felt like digging at the dry soil Anjelina, 32
Bakhita is involved in an experimental project that has brought together 200 women and men to take part in 15 weeks of group discussions about rape, domestic violence and forced marriage. Participants also learn techniques for non-violent communication. At the end of the project, each person makes a promise.
Anjelina, 32, a mother of five, was married at 15 to a man twice her age who already had two wives. “I had no idea about sex. My wedding night felt like digging at the dry soil. I learned that if husbands want you to bring food or water you do it without complaining, even if you are heavy with pregnancy.”
Anjelina’s promise is to help rape survivors in her community. “Rape is so common and is the big issue for me. We should not allow rape victims to suffer shame. I am really working on this.”
Mayan Awak, the community engagement officer who led the discussions, says men beat their wives as a show of masculinity. “Since I was six years old I was taught this is how it is, so I couldn’t just say, ‘This is wrong. Stop it’. Instead we asked people to talk openly – whether they are a chief or a housewife. I asked them to say honestly, ‘What are the things that pain you?’
“When we talked like this people saw that many of the problems they had were because of gender violence. For example, in our community, raids to steal cattle from another village are common and raping women is always a part of the raiding. But then people take revenge and use rape as a weapon, so there is more rape and more conflict. And on it goes.”

Awak says that at first the women “were quiet, fearing they would be chased away if they spoke”, but by the end were confidently coming up with ideas such as having women sit on tribal courts. The latter process will soon be underway locally, if permission is granted from the ministry of social development.
The men’s promises were along the lines of: “I will help my wife, I will cook, I will not beat my wife, I will wash the utensils.”
For Masumi Yamashina, child protection and gender-based violence specialist at Unicef, which is supporting the project (pdf), these are small but significant changes. “In Warrap it was considered a sin for men to do any household work. When I went there last, I saw men pumping water in water points. That was unthinkable before. I hope it’s a model we can expand not only in South Sudan but in other countries where social norms are unfair to women and girls.”
The project is being monitored through detailed interviews with participants. But it is hard to know just how meaningful the changes are. One man says his second wife is in her 30s because “it is right to marry an older woman”. His wife, however, says she is 16. But she does feel her husband is a changed man. “He is calmer. I really feel this. Before he beat us every day, but now it is less. I also watch him talking with other men in the community and I can see the way he behaves is different. He doesn’t get angry so easily.”
For Awak, who now cooks at home – to the initial horror of his family – this is the overall goal. “Gender violence isn’t just about men and women, it is about an imbalance of power – and from that all violence comes. By starting with these changes at home, we will have a calmer and more peaceful community generally. This is what I want for future generations.”"

Roger Gower, 37, from Birmingham, was tracking criminals who had killed three elephants near the Serengeti national park when one poacher opened fire. A high-calibre bullet passed through the floor of the helicopter, hitting Gower first in the leg then in the shoulder before exiting through the roof.
Despite his injuries, Gower managed to fly the helicopter down into a tree, allowing his spotter, Nicky Bester, time to jump out before it crashed to the ground.
Gower’s brother, Max, 42, has set up an online fundraising page to raise £50,000 to help anti-poaching efforts in Tanzania. Max said his brother was close friends with Bester and despite being an experienced anti-poaching pilot had only been flying missions in Tanzania since October or November.
“He was excited about the job. It’s a shame he hasn’t had an opportunity to do it for longer,” he said.
“I’m still trying to find out all the facts. He was obviously in some pain but the amount of time he spent suffering was pretty small and I don’t think he realised how badly he had been injured.
“It happened very quickly. He lost consciousness and I think he was alive for some time after that but he wouldn’t have known anything about it. He died next to somebody who was one of his great friends out there.
“He lived in a house with two other guys. The chap he was flying with – Nick Bester – was one of those people. My understanding is Roger was very close to those he shared a house with.”
Gower, a former accountant who qualified as a pilot in 2004, was flying anti-poaching missions every other day, Max said. He had worked in Kenya for 10 years, flying both commercial flights and anti-poaching missions, but moved recently to Tanzania to work for the Friedkin Conservation Fund in the Maswa game reserve, where he died on Friday afternoon.
Max added: “He was flying a lot of anti-poaching. He would never have gone near a poacher with a gun. Normally in a helicopter you see poachers a long way out of their range. There’s not that many places to hide.
“As I understand it, he was taken by surprise. He didn’t see the poachers until he was very close to them. I don’t know whether the guy was shooting to kill or not, but he killed him.”
Three men accused of harbouring and providing transport for the poachers have been arrested, but up to five others, including the gunman, are reportedly still at large.
Max said he had set up the Justgiving fundraising page to “do some good and raise money for a cause he [Roger] died working for”. In less than 24 hours, he had raised nearly £10,000 of the £50,000 target. Most, if not all, the funds will go to the Friedkin Conservation Fund that conserves more than 2.4m hectares (6.1m acres) of Tanzania’s protected wildlife areas.
He added: “It’s a displacement therapy because the more time you spend talking to people and doing something, the less time you spend worrying and grieving for the fact you’re never going to see your brother again.
“You realise there are so many good people out there: the world is full of amazing people and it’s just ruined occasionally by a very, very small minority who think and act differently to everybody else.”
Gower and his partner in Brazil had been trying to find a way to live together in the same country, Max said. “He had a girlfriend in Brazil, who I know he loved very much and she loved him. My parents spoke to her last night and she said she was expecting to spend the rest of her life with him.”
The Duke of Cambridge, who has campaigned against the ivory trade, was among those who paid tribute to Gower. Although the pilot was not known to Prince William, a spokesman for Kensington Palace said he was “very saddened to hear of yet more lives lost due to poaching”."

African countries have been congratulated for driving down malaria deaths on the continent.
The African Leaders Malaria Alliance (Alma) has presented awards of excellence to 14 African countries, including Liberia, Rwanda and Senegal for their performance in controlling malaria over the past four years, and Comoros, Guinea and Mali for showing the biggest improvements.
A further eight awards were given to countries that achieved the millennium development goal (MDG) target of halting and reversing the incidence of malaria. They were Botswana, Cape Verde, Eritrea, Namibia, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, South Africa and Swaziland.
Africa has made progress against malaria since 2000. Deaths from the disease have fallen by 66% among all age groups and by 71% among children under five.

Alma’s executive secretary, Joy Phumaphi, said that although more effort was required to reach the ambitious goal of eradicating malaria by 2030, the countries provided hope.
“This tremendous progress shows that an end to malaria is within reach,” Phumaphi said. “And there are important lessons to learn, including the fact that those countries have not relied solely on resources from donors, but have invested domestic funds in fighting malaria, which has been absolutely critical.”
She noted innovations that helped the countries succeed, including regional partnerships that allowed countries to fight malaria together while cutting medicine costs, as well as investments in the local manufacturing of insecticide bed nets that also provided jobs.
Alma produces quarterly scorecards for each African country. The scorecards track national policies, financial contributions, the delivery of treated bed nets and medicines, and lives saved. The alliance, of which 40 African heads of state are members, plans to extend its tracking to examine progress at district and state levels.

Liberia, Rwanda and Senegal all achieved reductions in malaria incidence of up to 75% between 2011 and 2015. Phumaphi said Liberia’s success was particularly impressive given the Ebola epidemic, which threatened to drain resources from other health programmes.
“Sustaining all of the work around malaria prevention, in the midst of the Ebola crisis, was a tremendous challenge for Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone,” Phumaphi said. “There were also a lot of misdiagnosis cases – people who presented with malaria were sometimes diagnosed with Ebola. Despite all of the challenges, and in the middle of such a brutal crisis, it is remarkable that countries continued to distribute bed nets and vector control programmes were aggressively applied. It could have been horrible, but instead Liberia managed to sustain the gains it had already made.”
Phumaphi also praised countries including Zambia and Chad that had made impressive gains in reducing malaria because of domestic investment. “There are many countries that may not have reached the MDG target but have still performed incredibly well; it’s just that they had different starting points,” she said.
The sustainable development goals (SDGs), which replaced the MDGs this year, aim to achieve universal health coverage and end the malaria epidemic by 2030. Among the obstacles are the dual threats of insecticide and drug resistance. In sub-Saharan Africa, mosquito resistance to insecticides is increasing, and, in south-east Asia, resistance to artemisinin, the most common drug used to treat malaria, is a significant threat.

“While we know what actions work to prevent malaria, we need more innovation in how to overcome drug and insecticide resistance – new treatments, new regimes, new vector-control approaches. And ultimately, we need a vaccine,” Phumaphi said.
Despite the challenges, Phumaphi said malaria prevention had the potential to create savings that could be spent on fighting other health inequalities.
“WHO have demonstrated that prevention efforts have saved an estimated $900m [$630m] in case management costs between 2001 and 2004, and that’s direct costs. Some economists have shown we can save up to $34bn a year in direct and indirect costs by eradicating malaria. That could be a massive contribution to other SDGs and ensure we succeed in other areas too.”"
African Union|International criminal court|Kenya|Ivory Coast|War crimes|Laurent Gbagbo|news,2016-02-01T13:54:53,guardian,Agence France-Presse,Leaders at Addis Ababa summit support pullout of international criminal court in protest at perceived unfair targeting,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/01/african-union-kenyan-plan-leave-international-criminal-court,African Union members back Kenyan plan to leave ICC,en,world|africa,,"Members of the African Union have backed a Kenyan proposal to push for withdrawal from the international criminal court, repeating claims that it unfairly targets the continent.
Chad’s president, Idriss Déby, who was elected African Union chairman at the two-day summit in Addis Ababa, criticised the court for focusing its efforts on African leaders.
“Elsewhere in the world, many things happen, many flagrant violations of human rights, but nobody cares,” Déby said at the close of the summit late on Sunday, which had an official theme of protecting human rights.
No legally binding decision was made, and the decision to leave the ICC’s founding Rome statute can be decided by individual nations. The decision was a “proposal … for the AU to develop a roadmap for the withdrawal of African nations”, a Kenyan presidential statement read.
The war crimes trial of the former Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo began last week, rekindling a bitter row across Africa over the international justice system.
Set up in 2002 as the last resort to try war criminals and perpetrators of genocide never tried at home, the ICC has opened inquiries involving nine nations, all but one of them African: Kenya, Ivory Coast, Libya, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic (twice), Uganda, Mali and, most recently, Georgia.

The AU, and particularly Kenya, has accused the court of unfairly targeting Africans for prosecution. Cases included a failed case to Kenya’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, and a faltering case against his deputy, William Ruto, for allegedly masterminding deadly post-election violence in 2007-09 in which about 1,200 people died.

“We refuse to be carried along in a vehicle that has strayed off course to the detriment of our sovereignty, security and dignity as Africans,” Kenyatta said in a statement.
In November 2015, Ethiopia’s foreign minister, Tedros Adhanom, speaking for the AU at an annual meeting of the 123 countries that have signed up to the Hague-based ICC’s founding statute, said it was “no longer a court for all”.
About one-third of the court’s member states are in Africa. While some leaders criticised the court, others said that was a mistake. “Leaving the ICC with no credible mechanism for justice for mass crimes in sight would be an error of colossal proportions,” Kenya’s Daily Nation said in an editorial.
“It is far better for member states to stay in the court and advocate reforms, rather than bolting and leaving millions on the continent unprotected by an international court which can step in when national institutions fail.”
On Monday the trial of Gbagbo continued, with defence lawyers accusing the current Ivorian president, Alassane Ouattara, of seizing power by force aided by the former colonial ruler France after disputed 2010 elections.

“Ouattara and his supporters wanted to seize power by force and the battle of Abidjan was, simply put, the very implementation of this strategy,” the defence lawyer Emmanuel Altit told the ICC.
Gbagbo and his co-accused, Charles Blé Goudé, a firebrand militia leader, have denied four charges of crimes against humanity when 3,000 people were killed after the Ivory Coast vote. Their highly anticipated trial opened on Thursday and is set to last three to four years.
Gbagbo declared himself the winner of the election in late 2010, which was contested by western powers including France and the US, and theUnited Nations-backed Ouattara.
It led to a bitter standoff, with Gbagbo holed up in the fortified presidential palace and Abidjan – the country’s main city and commercial capital – turned into a warzone.
The ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has alleged that Gbagbo, aided by the military, police and a youth militia group organised by Blé Goudé, tried to cling to power by “all means necessary”.
But Altit countered on Monday that there had been a deliberate campaign to make Gbagbo “out to be some of kind demon” and “paint Ouattara as the good guy”.
He said: “This is nothing more than a political narrative that has been heated up and re-served.”"

A British decision on whether to join western powers considering direct military intervention against Islamic State in Libya is likely to rest on whether long-running efforts to form a viable Libyan national unity government will materialise in the coming weeks.
The Pentagon and the French government have been pressing for direct action following a meeting in Paris last week, and Italy has said it would consider involvement. Downing Street said on Monday that no decisions had been taken regarding British troops and fended off questions about whether they would be deployed in a combat or training role.
US considering fresh military action in Libya over Isis threat Read more
The Ministry of Defence has not confirmed reports it is willing to send as many as 1,000 troops to the country, which has fallen into chaos following the violent overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi and allied air strikes in 2011.
Agreement on a Libyan national unity government was reached in December but so far has been rejected by rival Libyan parliaments, including the one recognised by the international community, in a dispute about ministries.
David Cameron will be reluctant to seek cross-party support in the Commons for further UK military action so soon after investing much political capital in winning support for airstrikes in Syria.
There is at present no support for airstrikes from the Africa Union, and it is likely that the Commons foreign affairs select committee will shortly produce a scathing report on the failure of western post-conflict planning after the 2011 toppling of Gaddafi.
Jeremy Corbyn, the opposition leader, is likely to oppose any intervention, and the shadow foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, would face a further dilemma over whether to support further military action against Isis.
If any action does go ahead it may be possible that British involvement would be so limited that it would not warrant Commons authorisation. Britain was previously active in the skies above Syria largely through surveillance and air-to-air refuelling without being involved in airstrikes. UK intelligence and special forces would not need Commons permission to operate in Libya. Britain has already sent a small number of troops to Sudan as part of an international peacekeeping force.
The talk of western military action in Libya restarted after the US defence secretary, Ash Carter, said last Thursday that allies were preparing options to prevent Isis from establishing training sites in Libya and welcoming foreign fighters in the way it had done in Iraq and Syria.
Last Friday Gen Joseph Dunford Jr, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said military officials were “looking to take decisive military action” against Isis.
The Pentagon has sent special forces to the area to look at military options to drive Isis from its base along a lengthy strip of coastline around the city of Sirte that lies between Benghazi and Tripoli.
It is claimed that as many as 3,000 Isis fighters are active in the country taking advantage of the political chaos to seize land and oilfields. The fighters may have gone to Libya because the now relatively secure Turkish-Syrian border has made it more difficult for potential recruits to join Isis in Syria.
Isis has used heavy weapons to launch attacks against a series of oil facilities and there has been an increase in suicide missions. US officials say there has been an influx of Isis fighters into Libya, partly as a result of the stronger controls on the flow of fighters into Syria from Turkey.
Italy’s defence minister, Roberta Pinotti, told Italian media last week that her country was considering joining the USs, Britain and France in military intervention to stabilise Libya. Pinotti told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that western powers would intervene only if requested to do so by Libyan authorities.
In an interview on French television Sunday, the French defence minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said there was an urgent need for a political solution in Libya. “I’ve been very worried about Libya since September 2014,” Le Drian said. “There they are just 200 miles from [the Italian island of] Lampedusa, and they are expanding.”

The French minister said there was a risk that Isis fighters would take advantage of the good weather to cross the Mediterranean and “mingle” with migrants.
“Everyone is aware of the risk that the conflict in Syria and Iraq, where we are seeing some positive results, will spread to become a new conflict in Libya,” he said. He that a political solution in Libya was “the only way to eradicate the problem”.
Le Drian concluded: “There must be a national unity government. There is a serious political process under way, supported by the UN security council. It is urgent.”
The African Union’s commissioner for peace and security, Smaïl Chergui, said of the Isis threat: “This is something that concerns us all and which demands vigorous action, but we can only do that if we have a government in place and Libyan forces that we can equip.
He said it was the union’s opinion that immediate military action “would further complicate the situation”.
In recent months the UN has struggled to persuade two groups of Libyan officials who claim to be the country’s rightful leaders to band together. On Monday the parliament that is recognised by the international community rejected a unity government proposal."
Transforming institutions|Working in development|Kenya|Refugees|Africa|features,2016-02-01T15:00:41,guardian,Daniel Wesangula,Residents of the world’s largest refugee complex are in a precarious position: unable to leave and yet awaiting expulsion,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/feb/01/dadaab-somalia-home-cannot-leave-refugees,Dadaab: the city you cannot leave,en,world|africa,,"For more than a decade now, Dadaab has held the dubious honour of being the world’s largest refugee camp.
Originally set up back in 1992 as a transit camp for those fleeing a war-torn Somalia, the refugee complex is home to over 350,000 mostly Somali refugees. It sits in one of the harshest terrains in Kenya and since it was meant to be a transition zone, houses are semi-permanent. The walls are built from twigs cut from surrounding shrubs. Some lucky residents have tin roofs, but for most pieces of canvas that were once pitched as tents form the much needed cover from the sun over their heads. Windows are not a priority, blocks of wood and straightened out USAid tin containers form doors. Houses are built close together leaving a narrow corridor between them. Most hardly rise above six feet.
In its 25 years of existence, the camp has been a home to hundreds of thousands of refugees in search of a safer, better life. Many have found this within the five camps that make up the massive complex. Life for them is safer. Exploding bombs and whizzing bullets become a distant memory. But for those within the camps, peace has come at a price: freedom.

Movement in and out of the camp has always been a challenge. Now though, it has become even harder. Kenya, their host country for a quarter of a century, is grappling with security challenges which authorities are blaming on refugees. The government has insinuated that the camp is a recruitment hotbed for terror group Al-Shabaab. This has made moving from one place to another difficult for the camp’s residents. Warsame Abdihakim came to Daadab in 1993 at the height of the chaos in Somalia and, like many of his friends and relatives, hasn’t ventured out of the complex since then. “We have tried, but our reasons are never good enough,” he says.
In order to be granted permission to leave the camp, residents need a special pass that can only be issued after a vetting process that includes oral interviews. “One time the motor to my ice maker broke down,” says Abdihakim. “I had to wait for a month for someone to bring me a replacement. How do I survive? By trusting those on the outside.” He is one of the biggest businessmen in Hagadera, one of the five camps that make up Dadaab, and runs a restaurant and an ice making plant. “Even with all this, they think if I leave the camp I will not come back,” he says.
As we grew older, we understood the limits of our lives
Family life in Dadaab
For all his life, 25-year-old Mohammed Abdi Abdulahi has been part of this boxed-in population. So has his wife. Now they have a daughter and all they want is a chance for their little girl to see the world outside. “We can’t let her grow up thinking this is all that life has to offer,” he says. “We want her to have a country she can call home.” Mohammed’s daughter, Sumaiya, is one of 6,000 grandchildren of the first arrivals that came to Dadaab in the early 1990s.
On one of the walls of the family’s hut an out-of-date calendar shows a green meadow, contrasting to the surroundings. Massive deforestation has left Dadaab devoid of almost all vegetation. An insatiable appetite for charcoal and wood for the construction of houses has stripped the ground bare. The golden brown soil stretches as far as the eye can see.
Abdulahi’s wife, Sara Hassan, says they once had dreams about their future, but now they have grown resigned to their fate. “We dreamt of getting a good education and good jobs. But as we grew older, we understood the limits of our lives,” she says. “We wouldn’t want Sumaiya to give up on her aspirations.” Her daughter, playing around her parents’ feet, has just turned three. In a year she will be enrolled in one of the schools within the camps run by NGOs.

The only way for the family to leave the camp is to qualify for asylum in an ongoing UNHCR resettlement programme and end up in another country. They have seen friends and family get settled all across Europe and the United States. But Abdulahi says that was before things got complicated.
“I am a father, husband, a refugee and Muslim from a country many do not understand. Events around the world make it hard to get asylum,” he says. “So I stay put and continue to re-apply for the asylum.”
Abdulahi says he has no preferred destination and jobs are hard to come by. With his secondary level education, he has worked for various NGOs. But a heightened threat level within the camps has forced many of such organisations to abandon operations in Dadaab, resulting in the shrinking of an already small job market. “I just want my family and I to get out,” he says.
Business in Dadaab
For others like Abdihakim, the ice shop owner, Dadaab is home. “If I leave, where will I go? I have been here for 25 years. I have learned to live with the limited movement,” he says.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Warsame Abdihakim serving customers at his ice shop. Photograph: Daniel Wesangula for the Guardian
He has no reason to leave. His restaurant, in the middle of a busy street near Hagadera’s main food and clothes market, is the busiest in the camp. Every day from sunrise to sunset hundreds attracted by the smell of cooking goat meat make their way to Midnimo Restaurant.
The camp’s outdoor market, popular for meat, sugar, spices, fruits and clothes is Abdihakim’s immediate neighbour. At lunchtime, it feels as if the whole market converges in his restaurant for a meal. The air is filled with sounds of hungry patrons calling out orders to a waiter at the end of the room, laughter from acquaintances sharing a plate of pasta and the voices of customers haggling over the price of a fabric or a kilo of khat. Spoons are hard to come by. Patrons prefer to eat with their hands. “Food is sweeter that way,” says Abdihakim, in the centre of it all.
Will a 'grand bargain' solve the humanitarian funding crisis? Read more
If the Kenyan government has its way however, Abdihakim will need to find a home elsewhere. In 2013 the government made links between the camp and the attack on Nairobi’s Westgate mall. As a result, the Kenyan government signed an agreement with UNHCR to work on voluntary repatriation of Somali refugees in Dadaab. Now, many in the camp know it is only a matter of time before they are sent “home” to Somalia. The Garissa University Massacre, in which terrorists linked to Dadaab killed 147 people, further strengthened government’s resolve to close the camp.
At the time of the massacre in April 2015, Kenya’s deputy president gave a three-month ultimatum for the camp to be shut down or the refugees forcefully moved back to Somalia. He has since taken a softer approach after concerns were raised by the international community. For now the camp remains, but no one knows for how much longer the third biggest city in Kenya will exist.

Wildlife|Endangered species|Ethiopia|Africa|Animals|Conservation|news,2016-02-01T15:16:39,guardian,,Local reports were confirmed when a population of previously unknown lions was caught on camera trap in the remote Alatash national park,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/01/lions-rediscovered-in-ethiopian-national-park,Lions rediscovered in Ethiopian national park,en,environment|wildlife,,"Conservationists have announced the “amazing discovery” of a previously unknown lion population in a remote north-western region of Ethiopia, confirming local reports with camera trap photographs for the first time.
Lions were spotted in the Alatash national park on Ethiopia’s border with Sudan, lion conservation group Born Free said.
“The confirmation that lions persist in this area is exciting news,” Born Free Foundation said in a statement.
“With lion numbers in steep decline across most of the African continent, the discovery of previously unconfirmed populations is hugely important.”
Hans Bauer, a lion conservationist from Oxford University who led the tracking expedition in Ethiopia, said there could be up to 200 lions in the area.
“Considering the relative ease with which lion signs were observed, it is likely that they are resident throughout Alatash and Dinder [in Sudan],” he said.
“On a total surface area of about 10,000 square kilometres, this would mean a population of 100-200 lions for the entire ecosystem, of which 27-54 would be in Alatash,” he said.

Lions have been put on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s “red list” of threatened species.
In the past few decades they have disappeared from much of Ethiopia. With 96 million people, it is Africa’s second most populous nation, and the number is growing by some 2 million people every year.
Ethiopia’s famous black-maned lions once represented a former emperor, “Lion of Judah” Haile Selassie, and were immortalised in a song by reggae legend Bob Marley. Today, they struggle for survival.
Lion numbers are estimated to have declined by between as much as three-quarters since 1980, and occupy less than 10% of its historic range across Africa."

A high court judge has ordered the release of a convicted Zimbabwean criminal who has spent more than two years in immigration detention pending his deportation.
Mr Justice Garnham ordered the release of Andre Babbage, who has a series of convictions for robbery, assault and cocaine dealing, despite accepting Home Office claims that he has no right to remain in Britain and is likely to abscond and commit further crimes.
The judge said the refusal of the Zimbabwean authorities to accept him back without a current passport meant that the home secretary, Theresa May, could no longer justify his continued detention in Britain as there was no realistic prospect of sending him back.
“[Babbage] is a Zimbabwean national with no right to remain in the UK, who has committed serious offences in this country and whose home country will only accept returning nationals if they have a passport or wish to return,” said Garnham.
“It is my judgment that [he] would be likely, if released, to abscond and to commit further offences. The question which arises here is whether the home secretary can justify [his] continued detention when he has made it clear he will not return home. My answer to that question is ‘no’.”
Babbage was born in Zimbabwe in 1986 and came to Britain with his mother in 2003. In 2008 he was convicted of supplying cocaine, and there followed a string of convictions over a three-year period for theft, assault, harassment and driving while drunk and uninsured.
In May 2011 he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison after being convicted of a “nasty robbery”, and in June 2013 a deportation order was made after he had served his time in prison. His period of immigration detention started in October 2013.
Home Office lawyers argued for Babbage’s continued detention on the grounds that he had consented to be sent back to Zimbabwe in December 2014 and might do so again, keeping alive the prospect that he could be deported.
But Garnham rejected that argument, pointing out that Babbage had repeatedly made clear he no longer consented to being returned to Zimbabwe and there was little prospect of that situation changing. He ruled that he had been detained unlawfully since at least August 2015 and should be released.
The decision to order Babbage’s release was made in December, but the ruling was only made public on Monday. Enforced removals to Zimbabwe have been suspended since 2005."

One of this year’s biggest is why a 25-year-old with corporate links to Hong Kong has donated $100,000 to the Liberal party of Australia.
Jiandong Huang may be one of the Liberal party’s youngest big-spending political donors but he is also one of its least well known.
Australian political donations 2014-15: resource tycoons and unions among top donors Read more
Australia’s major political parties have declared millions of dollars in political donations this year, with major donors including property developers, resource tycoons, unions and industry lobby groups.
The $100,000 given by Huang, a first-time donor, puts him in the top 20 list of benefactors to the Liberal party this year.
Huang does not appear to have lodged his own donation disclosure yet. All that is publicly available from the Liberal party’s own donation disclosure is his name and a residential address in the Melbourne suburb of Glen Waverley. No more is required by the party to identify him under federal donation laws.
Over the past two years Huang became a director of more than 20 companies in Australia. They include companies such as Australian Golden Swan Investment Group Pty Ltd, Australia King Eagle Investment Pty Ltd, Dongliang Pty Ltd and Australia Maxrich Pty Ltd. Most of these companies are largely unknown; basic web searches reveal little about their origins or business dealings.
A single news article from Property Observer suggests Huang’s companies may have some involvement in property development in Australia. The article says Australia King Eagle Investments Pty Ltd was involved in a $60m property development deal in Melbourne to purchase the old ­Kinnears rope factory site in the central business district.

Many of the companies Huang acts as director for are held beneficially by another company he directs, Australia Star Tower Holdings Pty Ltd. This company is in turn beneficially owned by a Hong Kong company, Star Tower Holding Limited.
Australia has no restrictions on foreign donations, unlike countries such as the United States, and increasingly wealthy offshore developers are making substantial political donations. Last year the mysterious Zi Chung Wang made the largest contribution ever to the Australian Labor party with a $850,000 donation. This year his company, Ever Bright Group, made another sizeable donation but to the Liberal party.
The laws surrounding political donations have been criticised by the Greens as extremely fraught. There is no ceiling on donations and laws surrounding identification are limited. The penalties for failing to disclose donations have been infrequently enforced and declarations are not in real time."

The Australian federal police says it has spoken to government frontbenchers Christopher Pyne and Wyatt Roy as part of its investigation into the release of the former Speaker’s diary.
Mal Brough stood aside as special minister of state in December, more than a month after the AFP raided his Sunshine Coast home, citing a forthcoming interview with the police and a lack of certainty about how long the investigation would take.
The AFP said it was yet to complete its investigation into the alleged unauthorised disclosure of the former Speaker Peter Slipper’s official diary, but confirmed it had been speaking to the three federal government MPs.
“Mr Brough, Mr Pyne and Mr Roy are assisting police with inquiries,” the AFP said on Monday.
Pyne is the minister for industry, innovation and science and the leader of the house, while Roy is the assistant minister for innovation.
Pyne’s spokesman said the minister “had an informal discussion with the AFP about the matter late last year”. Roy’s office declined to comment on the contact with police, but it is understood it was also of an informal nature.
The AFP said it had also spoken to Slipper’s former staffer James Ashby and understood he was seeking legal advice.
Ashby launched the sexual harassment case against Slipper in 2012 that contributed to his downfall as Speaker of the House of Representatives but was later dropped.
The former staffer has previously described speaking to Roy, who in turn sought advice from Pyne.
In an interview with the Australian in December, Ashby said Roy “then called me back and I went and saw him in his office and he presented me a sheet of paper with instructions of what I should do, and one of the first steps was to get a copy of the office diary. That is how I came to be printing off a copy of the digital diary – it was evidence in my case.”
Roy has previously confirmed seeking advice from Pyne about how someone could make a sexual harassment complaint. Roy told Sky News he suggested Ashby “diarise the events that are happening”.
The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, welcomed the developments in the investigation.
“I think it is long overdue for Christopher Pyne and Wyatt Roy to come clean on their role in the Peter Slipper/Mal Brough scandal,” he said.
Mal Brough, Peter Slipper's diary and #Ashbygate: the key issues explained Read more
Guardian Australia revealed in September 2015 that the AFP was still actively investigating the diary issue, a day after Brough was sworn in as a minister.
The controversy was revived a year earlier when the Nine Network’s 60 Minutes program broadcast a lengthy interview with Ashby. The journalist Liz Hayes also asked Brough: “Did you ask James Ashby to procure copies of Peter Slipper’s diary for you?”
He replied: “Yes I did.”
This exchange was critical to the controversy in the final parliamentary fortnight of 2015, when Brough implied the program had selectively edited the question.
After an extended transcript was released, Brough apologised to parliament “if my statement yesterday unwittingly added to the confusion rather than clarifying the matter”.
He then told parliament a categorical “no” when Labor asked the same question posed by Hayes about whether he asked Ashby to procure copies of the diary.
Brough withstood the parliamentary pressure and kept his job into the summer recess, only to stand aside on 29 December – the same day Jamie Briggs resigned as minister for cities and the built environment over “inappropriate” conduct towards a public servant in Hong Kong.
The AFP said it took the investigation “extremely seriously” and was conducting it in a “thorough” manner. “As this investigation remains ongoing, it is not appropriate to comment further,” it said.
Malcolm Turnbull is due to announce a frontbench reshuffle but has been awaiting an announcement by the leader of the Nationals and the deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, about his political future. Parliament is set to resume on Tuesday without a resolution of the matter."

The Palmer United Party senator Dio Wang will attempt to amend the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) bill to create a national corruption body, similar to the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac).
The Turnbull government will present a bill to reinstate the ABCC as its first piece of legislation this year when parliament resumes on Tuesday.
The Senate blocked the legislation last year but the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, is hoping to use the secret sixth volume of the Trade Union Royal Commission report to convince senate crossbenchers to support the building industry watchdog.
Labor and the Greens will not have access to the confidential briefings, which, according to the government, must remain secret to protect witnesses named in the report.
But Wang is in the process of drafting an amendment to broaden the legislation to create a federal corruption commission, although he has yet to discuss the proposal with the government.
“Obviously the current situation with the building and construction industry is quite daunting given that the royal commission has made some serious findings,” Wang told Guardian Australia.
Push to bring back ABCC building industry watchdog blocked by Senate Read more
“But also there is corruption anywhere and everywhere so a national Icac would be a really good authority to deal with it.”
He said the ABCC approach was too narrow and there was a need for a federal corruption body to focus not just on unions but on public officials, politicians and white-collar crime.
“Given the royal commission has done its work and the government has had two or three years talking about this issue, I think it’s the right time,” he said. “We have enough momentum to talk about a national Icac now.”
The government needs six of the eight senate crossbenchers to pass the ABCC bill. If it is rejected again by the Senate, it provides another potential trigger for a double-dissolution election.
Asked whether the government would consider using the issue for a double dissolution, Cash said: “That is a thing that the PM would obviously need to authorise himself but certainly we have said we will take both of these policies to the next election whether that be sooner or later. We are prepared to go back to the Australian people as we did in 2013.”
The independent senator John Madigan also called on the Turnbull government to take a broader approach to corruption but would not comment on the federal corruption commission proposal until he had seen more details.
“When constituents approach me complaining of corruption, unfair practices and unconscionable conduct their complaints inevitably relate to their treatment at the hands of banks, financial planners, lawyers, accountants, valuers, doctors, builders, major supermarket chains or government departments,” he said.
“Not once has a constituent approached me to complain that they were ripped off by their union, yet this seems to be the government’s exclusive focus.”
Madigan said that illegal activities needed to be “stamped out” but criticised the Turnbull government’s approach as having “more than a whiff of ideology about it”.

He said if the government’s ABCC bill was aimed at corruption across the board he would sign up tomorrow.
“It is not just a happy coincidence for the Coalition that [Dyson] Heydon’s report appeared at the beginning of an election year,” he said.
“This gives it ammunition to, firstly, pressure the Senate to pass anti-union laws it previously rejected and, secondly, to fight an election campaign on this issue against an opponent it hopes will be sullied through its association with the union movement.”
The independent senator Jacqui Lambie told the ABC she would not support the ABCC bill while the government was considering making cuts to Medicare.
And the Liberal Democratic senator David Leyonhjelm wants to place an eight-year sunset clause on the legislation so it does not stay on the statute books indefinitely.
When the Greens tried to introduce a bill to establish a federal commission against corruption in 2014, Coalition senators argued the current multi-agency approach was sufficient to fight corruption while Labor senators argued that it was “premature”.
At the federal Labor conference last year, a former party vice-president, Tony Sheldon, who is the national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, included a motion for a federal Icac but it was taken down at the last minute.
At that time, the shadow special minister of state, Gary Gray, echoed the Coalition by saying the existing agencies were already working."

The Liberal party of Australia accepted a $25,000 contribution from a gas company months after it was charged over what has since emerged as potentially one of the country’s biggest environmental pollution cases.
Linc Energy gave $25,000 to the federal arm of the Liberal party some time between July 2014 and June 2015, according to Australian Electoral Commission records released on Monday.
The company, which had shifted its base from Australia to Singapore in 2013, was first charged in April 2014 over alleged serious environmental harm caused by gas leaks from Linc’s underground coal gasification plant near Chinchilla.
The prosecution continues, with Linc since hit with further criminal charges of wilfully causing serious environmental harm through toxic damage to air, groundwater and soil over up to 320 square kilometres of farmland.
Gas companies treated staff at industry regulator to cocktail parties and ballet Read more
Linc faces fines of up to $32.5m if found guilty.
Anti-gas industry protest group Lock The Gate called on the Liberal party to return the “tainted donations” it received from Linc after it was charged.
Comment was sought from the Liberal party.
The environment department has alleged in court documents that Linc attempted to hide the plant’s problems from government officials in 2012, after persistent leaks of toxic gas into the air and groundwater over the preceding three years.
The department alleged four government workers were treated in hospital for suspected gas poisoning from the Hopeland site.
George Bender – the activist whose suicide last year after a decade-long battle with gas companies brought the issue of farmer land rights to national attention – was among the landholders near Chinchilla warned by the government not to dig below two metres because of the risk of gas explosions.
Despite the Linc case and the earlier prosecution of Cougar Energy, which was fined $75,000 for releasing a carcinogenic chemical into groundwater near Kingaroy, the underground coal gasification (UCG) industry continues to seek a foothold in Queensland.
Carbon Energy has revealed in a statement to the Australian stock exchange it was seeking approval from the Queensland government to prepare an environmental impact statement for another UCG project near Chinchilla.

Lock The Gate called on governments to ban what it said was a “dangerous, polluting industry”.
Michael Roche, the chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council, said gasification of coal had “enormous potential as a source of clean synthetic fuels”.
“It is difficult to see why Lock the Gate would want to pre-empt the results of a live court case relating to a specific company by banning a whole category of energy production,” Roche said.
In the four years leading up to its prosecution, Linc gave $352,799 to political parties.
Of this, $203,000 went to the federal Liberal party, $124,999 to the Queensland Liberal National party and $24,000 to the Queensland Labor party.
Since 2010, it has also given $264,000 worth of sponsorship to the Walkley foundation, which runs Australian journalism’s highest awards. One Walkley was won last year by ABC reporters covering the Linc case."

The editor of the Australian, Clive Mathieson, has quit the paper for a job with the NSW Liberal government after being passed over for the job of editor-in-chief.
Mathieson has been a popular editor for the past five years, working under the former editor-in-chief Chris Mitchell on Rupert Murdoch’s national broadsheet.
But after 16 years he has walked away from journalism to take up the role of director of economic, infrastructure and state priorities in Mike Baird’s office.
When Mitchell retired late last year he was replaced by Paul Whittaker, the former editor of the Daily Telegraph, rather than Mathieson or his other deputy, the editor of the Weekend Australian, Michelle Gunn.
Despite Mathieson’s ability, it became unlikely he would inherit the role when Mitchell told a media and marketing conference in 2014 that he would retire when there was an obvious successor.

“I would like to hand the paper and the digital businesses over in a good state,” he said. “I would like to have clearly defined successors who I felt were ready for it.”
On Monday afternoon Whittaker announced Mathieson was leaving the paper and the media for a senior role with Baird’s government.
“An accomplished journalist for more than 20 years, Clive started his career at the Advertiser in Adelaide and moved to the Australian in Sydney in 1996,” Whittaker told staff.
“He joined the business section of the Times in 1999 and spent three years in London before returning to the Australian in 2002.
“Since then he has worked across the paper and has been responsible for some key achievements: as business editor and deputy editor (business) he was instrumental in revitalising the paper’s business coverage and as editor he oversaw the business section’s relaunch in 2014 as the Australian Business Review. Clive also led the redesign of the paper in 2009.
“Clive has been a loyal and trusted colleague and on a personal level I will miss his support and absolute commitment.”
A new editor would be announced at a later date, Whittaker said."
Victoria|Birds|Animal welfare|Wildlife|news,2016-02-01T08:43:08,guardian,Calla Wahlquist,RSPCA says Field and Game Australia’s suggestion ‘unbelievable’ after data showing decline in waterbirds in south-eastern Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/01/shooting-lobby-calls-for-five-year-moratorium-on-duck-hunting-rules,Shooting lobby calls for five-year moratorium on duck hunting rules,en,world|australia,,"The shooting lobby has called for a five-year moratorium on new duck hunting restrictions in Victoria, saying it would allow regulators to study the impact of hunting on duck and other waterfowl populations.
The RSPCA has described the suggestion as “unbelievable” given the wealth of data, collected by the University of NSW annual aerial bird survey, which shows a 33-year decline in the abundance of waterbirds in south-eastern Australia.
But the Victorian president of the Shooters Association of Australia, Jack Wegman, said the proposal would provide a sizeable dataset from which to make decisions about hunting restrictions.
“This is not about some tricky clever way to get hunters unlimited access for 10 years,” Wegman told Guardian Australia. “That might be a side effect [but] this is about the science of it. It’s not about a hunting expansion under the guise of a trial.”
Duck hunting season opens with tougher laws aimed at protesters Read more
The suggestion was put forward by Field and Game Australia (FGA) in a submission to the Game Management Authority’s annual preseason consultation in December.
It said “simplifying” the duck hunting regulation by allowing a 12-week season with a daily bag limit of 10 ducks for a set number of years would “permit the collection of more accurate data”, which could in turn inform the need for more restrictive hunting regulations.
“This continued application of modifications to the 2015 hunting season has again prevented conclusions being drawn on the impact of hunting on sustainable waterfowl populations,” the FGA’s submission said. “This leaves conjecture as to whether environment, habitat or hunter participation contributed to the reduced harvest in 2015.”
Daily bag limits in the 2015 season were set at eight ducks on the opening day and five every day thereafter.
The bag limits for the 2016 season have been knocked down once more – eight birds on opening day, 19 March, and four a day for the rest of the 12-week season.
Announcing the duck season dates last month, the Victorian agriculture minister, Jaala Pulford, said reduced bag limits were based on the GMA’s advice about historically low bird numbers and low rainfall, which affected waterbird habitat.
According to the GMA’s briefing document, released in December, the wetland index was at its lowest ever level due to successive years with below-average rainfall and waterbird and game duck populations were at their second lowest levels on record.
The RSPCA, in its response to that briefing, said the combination of factors made this year “one of the worst possible environments on record in which to hold a duck shooting season”.
Victoria’s 26,000 licensed duck hunters reported killing 203,935 ducks in 2015, most of which were bagged on opening weekend. That figure does not include ducks that were injured but not retrieved, which the RSPCA suggested could be as high as one wounded for every one killed in some areas.
The chief executive of the RSPCA, Dr Liz Walker, said the organisation’s position on the 2016 season went beyond its long-held opposition to any form of recreational hunting, saying “we have put the long-term survival of the species at risk”.
The Victorian Labor party is also reportedly angry about the decision, which runs counter to the ban on all recreational wildlife hunting proposed by the party’s environment policy committee before the 2014 election.
The Victorian Greens leader, Greg Barber, accused the Andrews government of political cowardice for refusing the cancel the duck hunting season, as happened in 2008 after a similarly dry winter.
“They are more scared of the concentrated anger of 20,000 duck hunters than they are of the broader public opinion, which has said, again and again, that duck hunting should be banned,” he said.
He said the economic benefit of the sport, mentioned by Pulford in her statement about the 2016 season dates, was overstated. According to a government report, duck hunting was worth $439m to the Victorian economy in 2013, a figure Barber said was based on the assumption that those who spent their money on a hunting trip would not spend it at all if shooting ducks was not an option.
Barber said minutes of the GMA’s meetings, obtained by the Greens under freedom of information, showed it was acting “like a lobby group”. The minutes, seen by Guardian Australia, show the GMA requested an “active role” in decisions about whether water released for environmental flows aligned with hunting opportunities; mention the chief executive writing to Victorian police after hunters complained of their treatment by officers; and voted to recommend an extensive review of all state game reserves “to determine by exception why all legal game and best animals cannot be hunted”.
“You can’t be a regulator and a promoter,” Barber said."

When Jamie Gao walked into a darkened south-west Sydney storage unit two years ago, he thought he was about to become a rich man, a jury has heard.
But prosecutors say Gao never got rich, and he never walked out.
Instead, the crown says, Gao was murdered inside the Padstow Rent A Space by Roger Rogerson and Glen McNamara, who then stuffed his body into a surfboard bag and dumped it out at sea.
Rogerson and McNamara have pleaded not guilty to murdering Gao on 20 May 2014.
On the opening day of their high-profile New South Wales supreme court trial, crown prosecutor Chris Maxwell QC told the 15-member jury that on 26 May 2014 fishermen spotted the young man’s body bobbing up and down in waters off Cronulla, tied up and wrapped in a surfboard bag and a blue tarpaulin.
Maxwell said CCTV cameras had captured Gao heading inside the Padstow storage shed with McNamara about 1.46pm on 20 May, followed closely by Rogerson.
Just over half an hour later, CCTV footage showed the two older men dragging out a silver surfboard cover – which was “obviously of considerable weight” and allegedly hid Gao’s body – and loading it into a waiting station wagon.
After Gao’s body was recovered from the water, Maxwell said, a post-mortem examination showed he had been shot twice in the chest.
“[Gao] went to that meeting and went into that storage shed thinking that what was to happen would shortly make him very rich,” Maxwell said. “Instead he was shot and killed and dragged to the back of the station wagon and dumped at sea.”
A number of Gao’s relatives are expected to give evidence during the trial about his alleged involvement with illicit drugs, including a cousin who will testify the dead man once told him “street dealing was below him”.
“If you’re going to do a deal, it is better to do one big deal,” Gao is said to have told his relative.
Prosecutors say Gao later bragged about a “massive” deal with “Glen”, adding that he “was going to be rich soon”.
It is the crown’s case that Gao had met McNamara a year earlier when he did some Cantonese interpreting work in a separate drug case, and that his role in the “massive deal” in May 2014 was to deliver a large quantity of methylamphetamine, or ice.
It is alleged McNamara and Rogerson took the drugs after shooting Gao.
Prosecutors say 2.78kg of the drug ice was found in a station wagon parked under McNamara’s Cronulla unit before Gao’s body was discovered.
Maxwell said there were a number of different ways Gao’s killing may have taken place, but that the crown did not need to establish which of the accused men pulled the trigger.
He said the jury could find both Rogerson and McNamara guilty of murder as long as they were satisfied the two men were part of an agreement to kill or very seriously injure Gao.
The trial continues."

Australia runs the risk of becoming a “nation of bystanders” if it becomes complacent about fighting domestic violence, the former chief of army and 2016 Australian of the Year David Morrison has said.
Morrison appeared on ABC’s Q&A program on Monday night along with Guardian Australia’s Indigenous affairs editor, Stan Grant; director of emergency at St Vincent’s hospital, Gordian Fulde; the director of the Sydney Story Factory, Catherine Keenan, and young Australian of the Year finalist Manal Younus.

Asked about statistics that purported to show the number of incidents of reported domestic violence had fallen, Morrison said: “We are as a society becoming more aware of, I think, the greatest social challenge we face, and that is domestic violence in this country.”
He rejected the claims about the statistics, and said: “Get real Australia. We run the risk at times of being a nation of bystanders comforted by a set of statistics.
“Let me tell you, there are people dying, and people whose lives are absolutely ruined as a result of domestic violence. And what’s more, we are all as a society, the victim. That’s bullshit.”
The debate on Q&A focused on issues of race, diversity, domestic violence and how Australia could both celebrate and mourn the history of its Indigenous population and colonial history.

Morrison also warned about limited funding for many frontline support services.
“They are all stretched,” he said. “There is now a demand out there. Women, children, men too are putting their hands up and saying: I can no longer live this way.
“We are all stretched to deal with this, but if we don’t deal with it, what is the legacy we leave for those who follow us?”
Keenan told the panel there were “women dying every day, it’s still something we as a society have to address”.
Fulde added that domestic violence statistics should be treated cautiously, and that it remained an extraordinary concern.
He said: “The sad reality, the number of patients who come to emergency department who are offered counselling, still they say no. They don’t even want the police involved. It really is so, so large.”
Morrison also said Australia was at a “tipping point” for having a national conversation about diversity.
He told the panel: “Diversity is about encouraging diversity of thinking …conversations in the country, conversations in the workplace, conversation in the family that we haven’t had in this country to a great extent before.”
Younes, who helped to set up the not-for-profit Welcome to Australia to embrace multiculturalism, said it was important for women and people from minority backgrounds to be given the opportunity to take up platforms to help effect change.
ABC Q&A (@QandA) ""In health, we don't have labels...you are a human being in need"" says Gordian Fulde #QandA https://t.co/a4W2cge0Ri
Morrison told the panel he was the “most surprised person probably on the planet” when his name was read out as Australian of the Year. His receipt of the award has been questioned, with leading women such as former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick and transgender RAAF officer Catherine McGregor passed over.
Grant defended Morrison’s award, saying there had been a “lack of respect” in some of the criticism.
Grant, whose recent speech on racism in Australia has been widely viewed, spoke at length about the plight of Australia’s Indigenous communities following questions about whether Australia Day should be moved to another day.
Grant said: “What other days are there? Do we celebrate the day of federation?
“For us as Indigenous people there are many aspects to it. One is to mourn the invasion, to mourn dispossession and the consequences,” he said. “But we need to acknowledge the fact that Australia is a remarkable country … we need to acknowledge that.
“But we have not signed a treaty [with Indigenous people] … we are the only Commonwealth government that has not signed a treaty.”

Morrison also said there was a legitimate argument for moving Australia Day, “when you don’t have the national day of your country being agreed to in terms of the date by all the members of your country”."

Health|GST (Goods and Services Tax)|Australian politics|Coalition|Scott Morrison|Jay Weatherill|news,2016-02-01T19:00:28,guardian,Lenore Taylor,Exclusive: State and federal governments to consider replacing commonwealth health insurance rebate with direct subsidies for hospital procedures,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/02/radical-changes-to-hospital-funding-on-the-table-to-settle-gst-debate,Radical changes to hospital funding on the table to settle GST debate,en,world|australia,,"Federal and state governments are considering abandoning the $6bn commonwealth health insurance rebate in favour of direct subsidies to private hospitals in a radical revamp of hospital funding, a leaked draft agreement reveals.
The hospital shake-up is one of a series of complex interlinked deals critical to the commonwealth’s chances of getting state government support for an increase in the goods and services tax – shaping as the central battleground of this year’s federal election.
The document – marked “COAG in confidence” and prepared for the April council of Australian governments meeting - proposes the commonwealth pay an agreed percentage of the cost of each hospital procedure under a new “hospitals benefit”, regardless of whether the service is provided in a public or private hospital or to a public or private patient.
It says the commonwealth could finance the new hospital benefit by “repurposing existing funding, possibly including public hospital funding transfers to the states ... and the private health insurance rebate.” Unlike much of the draft paper, this paragraph is in brackets, indicating continued disagreement.
After the scrapping of the private health insurance rebate was floated in a Sunday Telegraph article after the last Coag meeting late last year, health minister Sussan Ley confirmed it was being considered but indicated it was not her preferred option.
Scott Morrison needs more than slogans to sell GST increase to sceptical voters | Lenore Taylor Read more
But with the states demanding billions of dollars in “transitional” funding for hospitals and schools before they will support any increase in the GST, an agreement on a long term “efficient” funding revamp remains critical to the final tax deal and is one of six draft agreements being prepared for the April Coag.
In the Coag documents the federal government also demands the states increase their own revenue, pointing out that some taxes levied by the states are “very efficient”.
They say payments of the new, efficient hospital benefits should “not be capped”.
It would be determined independently and “follow the individual”, with the states paying the portion of the hospital benefit not covered by the commonwealth as well as the costs of running public hospitals that continue to provide free care.
The commonwealth would pay for the independent body that set the hospital benefit price and the agreed federal share of that price for each procedure.
Private health insurers would pay the difference between the commonwealth’s share of the hospital benefit price and the cost of the procedure in a private hospital.
“Under this reform, the commonwealth and the states will be jointly responsible for the growth in public hospital expenditure. This will encourage ongoing commitment from all governments to drive efficiencies across the entire health system (such as better use of primary care settings) so that expensive hospital services are used as the care of ‘last resort’,” the paper says.
The document suggests the revamped system could begin as soon as July 2018. The states see it as a way to convince the commonwealth that health spending is being used efficiently, but continue to insist the federal government must provide significant extra money to avoid a looming hospitals “crisis”.
The New South Wales and South Australian premiers have joined forces to tell treasurer Scott Morrison that finding extra federal funding to head off a looming hospitals and schools funding “cliff” is a “non negotiable” condition of their support for increasing the GST.
Baird has proposed the commonwealth provide an extra $7bn for schools and hospitals over the next four years before agreeing on the longer term revamp.
Morrison did not completely rule out the Baird plan but was decidedly cool in response, saying raising revenue in order to spend it was “Labor’s tax and spend approach”.
Public hospitals to be ‘biggest financial challenge’ faced by state governments Read more
“The idea of raising taxes just for more spending, that’s really what Labor does, it’s something that we’re not particularly attracted to when it comes to this tax and spend. We want to see a tax system that’s growth friendly, not a tax system that is just feeding an ever growing appetite for higher and higher spending which is Labor’s approach,” he said.
South Australian premier Jay Weatherill – who has angered federal Labor colleagues by remaining open to an increase in the GST – attacked Morrison’s suggestion that demands for extra money for hospitals showed the states had a “spending problem”.
“Treasurer Morrison is perpetrating the same deceit on the Australian people that was perpetrated by Treasurer Hockey ... and that is that we have a spending problem and not a revenue problem ... he cannot continue to perpetrate this deceit when we have hospitals and schools that demand the services that are necessary ... these are basic fundamental needs,” he told Sky News.
Asked by Guardian Australia whether the extra money for hospitals and schools was “non negotiable” for the states, Baird said: “Yes, that’s right. The federal government’s contribution towards hospitals and schools has to go up.”
“The states require a return to surety on health and education. there’s no point both sides continuing to point at each other and say you fix it. What Jay Weatherill and I are saying is this is not someone else’s problem Let’s deal with it now.”
The idea of a hospital benefit schedule was proposed as an option in the white paper on the reform of the federation."

Staunchly National party-voting regional electorates want Malcolm Turnbull to abandon the idea of a national plebiscite on marriage equality in favour of a parliamentary vote that would quickly resolve the issue, according to a new poll.
The survey aims to increase pressure on the government to ditch the Abbott-era promise to hold a plebiscite after the next election, but did not ask voters in the three electorates polled whether they supported marriage equality.
Same-sex marriage: Turnbull pushes on with Abbott's plebiscite, and it's still daft Read more
Instead the Reachtel research, commissioned by Australian Marriage Equality (AME), asked voters whether they supported the idea of a plebiscite that cost $158m and would not bind politicians (57.5% said they did not); whether the issue should be resolved through a parliamentary vote without a plebiscite first (56.3% said yes); and whether they wanted to see it resolved sooner rather than later, even if that meant same-sex marriage became legal (61.9% said yes).
It also asked whether they thought a plebiscite was a good use of taxpayer money (63.5% said it was a poor or very poor use of money).
Voters in the Victorian seat of Gippsland, the NSW seat of New England and the Queensland seat of Capricornia – all held by the Nationals – had not been asked their view on same sex marriage, an AME spokesman said, because there was “already plenty of evidence a majority of Australians support marriage equality”.
The member for Gippsland, Darren Chester, was the first Nationals MP to announce he supported marriage equality, saying last year he had “tested the mood” in his electorate and detected a significant shift over several years.
The member for New England – and possibly next National party leader – Barnaby Joyce is an opponent and has compared marriage equality with “making a definition into something that it’s not” and passing “a piece of legislation that said that a diamond is a square”.
The member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry, has not declared a position.
“This poll shows regional and rural Australians want parliament to move on marriage equality soon and for the government to drop its plan for an expensive, divisive, delaying plebiscite,” Croome said.
“The political reason for the plebiscite was to smooth over divisions in the Coalition and take marriage equality off the agenda in the lead-up to the election, but that hasn’t worked. It’s time for Malcolm Turnbull to bring back marriage equality legislation, allow a free vote and get this done straight away so Australia can move on.”
The point of the plebiscite was called into question last week after senators Eric Abetz and Cory Bernardi, and Nationals MP Bridget McKenzie, confirmed they would vote against marriage equality in parliament even if the national plebiscite supported it.
Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull told parliament last October his government would abide by the decision made by the Australian people and anyone arguing otherwise was “not living in the real world”.

“When the Australian people make their decision, that decision will stick,” he said. “It will be decisive. It will be respected by this government and by this parliament and this nation.”
Former prime minister Tony Abbott, an opponent of marriage equality, said he would vote in line with the result of a plebiscite.
Labor leader Bill Shorten has asked Turnbull to drop the idea of a plebiscite.
The attorney general, George Brandis, is drafting legislation to define the question to be put to a plebiscite after the federal election, the exemptions that would apply to churches and other organisations, and whether voting would be compulsory. It will go to cabinet, and the Coalition party room, next month.
The idea of a plebiscite emerged from a six-hour Coalition party room meeting last October as the Irish referendum vote and the US supreme court decision boosted momentum for a free vote on a cross party bill before the parliament. Turnbull criticised the policy at the time, but agreed to adopt it in a deal with the National party after he became prime minister.
The number of MPs and senators who have declared they would vote to support same-sex marriage is slightly less than half in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
But a confidential list compiled by AME and seen by Guardian Australia, includes six members of the lower house and four senators who AME says have privately indicated they would vote in favour of same-sex marriage.
Guardian Australia has not independently verified the voting intention of these MPs and senators, but if AME’s assessment of their intentions is correct, it would take the number of MPs in favour to 78 – a majority in the 150-strong house of representatives – and the number of senators to 41, a majority of the 76-seat Senate.
AME assesses another eight lower house members and four senators as likely supporters."

On the brink: Queensland’s banana growers live in fear of a deadly fungus Read more
Talks between the Robson family and the Australian Banana Growers’ Council (ABGC) over an industry takeover of their Tully Valley farm, which would have been shut down to contain an outbreak of Panama tropical race 4 (TR4), ended without success last week.
In a statement the family said it was clear the north Queensland industry would prefer the closure of their farm, which remains the only site of TR4 contamination in a region that grows 95% of Australia’s most popular food.
But the Robsons declined offers from the ABGC for a grower-funded buyout or lease, which would have led to all plants on the farm being destroyed and production scuttled.
Bevan Robson said his family had thought “long and hard” but decided they were “better off continuing to farm”. This was despite time-consuming and costly quarantine measures in place, including daily camera surveillance at their farm gate by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.
“We know the industry wants us to stop farming but I need to put my family first,” Robson said. “If a Panama disease-resistant banana is developed in a few months’ time, we would never be able to get back to where we are now.”
Quarantine measures have managed to keep TR4, a soil-borne disease that kills banana plants but leaves fruit unaffected, to the one farm since Robson alerted authorities 10 months ago.
If that success continues, it would represent the first containment of TR4 since the 1980s, when it began cutting a swath through most of the world’s major banana growing regions outside South America.
The source of the contamination remains a mystery, although a common local theory is that it arrived on the feet of magpie geese that flew from the Northern Territory, where TR4 is prevalent.
Efforts to breed TR4-resistant banana crops include an International Atomic Energy Agency project using radiation to create new plant varieties.
Banana growers asked to help create fund to support those hit by fungus Read more
The Robsons’ farm is surrounded by a quarantine barrier, with workers required to take their shoes off. Machinery or any other item that touches the ground is forbidden from leaving the farm and vehicles are sprayed on entry and exit.
The chair of the ABGC, Doug Phillips, said the buyout and lease proposals were just two options discussed as part of the industry’s deliberations on reducing the risk of TR4 spreading through North Queensland.
“The ABGC would like to thank the Robson family for participating in the discussions and considering the proposals put to them,” Phillips said. “It’s clear from all our discussions that industry members are very focused on ensuring TR4 remains contained.”
Under biosecurity laws, the state government would be required to compensate the family for their destroyed crops but not for lost income through the end of their growing enterprise.
The Robsons’ solicitor, Ian Conrad, said the family was in discussions with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries over some compensation including for lost production over the initial quarantine period."

The talking points were leaked within hours of being sent out on Monday night and canvassed topics such as jobs and growth, innovation, school funding and the royal commission into trade unions, the ABC reported.
The email included a social media meme mocking union donations to the Labor party.
The talking points ask party members to focus on jobs and growth, the government’s innovation plan, proposed changes to pathology services, school funding and the trade union royal commission.
They include the line: “Can Bill Shorten point to a single savings measure that Labor is proposing, other than scrapping the $1.3bn emissions reduction fund and replacing it with a carbon tax that will hit every Australian family when it comes to paying the electricity bill?”
The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, played down claims of dissent within the government.
“I believe the Turnbull government is a strong and united team,” he told ABC Radio.
There was nothing unusual about a government communicating with MPs and senators about its priorities and why its approach was better than the opposition, he said.
The resources minister, Josh Frydenberg, acknowledged some people within the Coalition might be disgruntled but said this did not reflect a broader sense of disunity.

French President Francois Hollande has pardoned a woman who was jailed for 10 years for killing her husband after he abused her for decades.
“In the face of an exceptional human situation, the president wanted to make it possible for (Jacqueline) Sauvage to return to her family as soon as possible,” the presidency said in a statement.
French face jail for psychological abuse of partners Read more
The rare pardon granted by Hollande amounts to a reduction of Sauvage’s sentence that will allow the 68-year-old to leave prison in mid-April, her lawyers said. By then, she will have spent more than three years behind bars.
The gesture came just two days after the president met for the first time with Sauvage’s three daughters and her lawyers on Friday.
Sauvage’s case had become a cause célèbre in France, with more than 400,000 people signing a petition demanding her release.
“I’m overwhelmed, happy, grateful, relieved,” said Eva Darlan, founder of an advocacy group for Sauvage.
Sauvage was married for 47 years to Norbert Marot, a violent alcoholic who she said raped and beat her and her three daughters and also abused her son.
On September 10, 2012, the day after her son hanged himself, Sauvage shot her husband three times in the back with a rifle.
She was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison in October 2014, which was upheld on appeal in December 2015 as the state rejected her plea of self-defence.
The group Osez le Feminisme (Dare To Be Feminist) called for the definition of self-defence to be expanded in cases of “female victims of violence”.
Sauvage’s case has cast a spotlight on the tricky and controversial legal argument known as “battered woman syndrome”.
Her lawyer Nathalie Tomasini had appealed to the court to “push the limits of self-defence applied to situations of marital violence.”
In French law for an act to be considered self-defence it must be seen as proportional and in direct response to an act of aggression.
Killing in response to repeated acts of violence suffered over decades, as in Sauvage’s case, did not meet this test.
She was faulted for her passivity faced with the violence and incest carried out by her husband.
“We were afraid of him, he terrified us,” one of her daughters told the court.
Another of her daughters, raped at the age of 16, described her father’s death as a “relief”.
When campaigning for the presidency in 2012, Hollande distanced himself from presidential pardons, describing them as belonging to “a different concept of power”.
He has used the power only once before, when he freed convicted bank robber Philippe El Shennawy – who had spent 38 years behind bars – in 2014."

Italian police have reportedly arrested a man for attempted murder after he used a bidet as a weapon during a fight.
The unusual incident took place after a football game between neighbouring children in Pozzuoli, near Naples, degenerated into a shouting match when one player accused another of a particularly dirty foul.
The argument worsened and became violent when the boys’ parents stepped in to defend their sons.
Just as police officers arrived on the scene in the seaside town in southern Italy, Domenico Cammarota, 45, the father of one of the boys, threw a bidet out of the window of his apartment, hitting another father in the street below on the head.
The injured man, who was knocked unconscious by the flying bathroom appliance, was taken to hospital, while Cammarota – who was already known to the police – was jailed, according to Il Messaggero daily."

Ai has been working in a studio on the Greek island as part of several projects that engage with the refugee crisis. The island has been a key point of entry into the European Union for thousands of refugees.
According to the Washington Post, the image of Ai was taken by photographer Rohit Chawla for the magazine India Today and an accompanying exhibition at the India Art Fair. Ai and his team were involved in the staging of the image.
Co-owner of the India Art Fair, Sandy Angus told the Washington Post: “It is an iconic image because it is very political, human and involves an incredibly important artist like Ai Weiwei.
“The image is haunting and represents the whole immigration crisis and the hopelessness of the people who have tried to escape their pasts for a better future.”

Photos and videos posted on the Facebook page of Ai’s studio with the hashtags #refugees and #lesvos depicted women, men and children wearing lifejackets and being given food and drink.
The previous day Ai announced his decision to close the exhibition Ruptures at Denmark’s Faurschou Foundation Copenhagen, in protest at a new law that allows Danish authorities to seize valuables from asylum seekers.

“They come with nothing, barefoot, in such cold, they have to walk across the rocky beach. Then you have this news; it made me feel very angry.
“The way I can protest is that I can withdraw my works from that country. It is very simple, very symbolic – I cannot co-exist, I cannot stand in front of these people, and see these policies. It is a personal act, very simple; an artist trying not just to watch events but to act, and I made this decision spontaneously.”"

Instead of swinging the metaphorical man-bag, he looks for common ground and enumerates the issues that remain controversial, striving to expand the former and resolve or defer the latter.
Like Tony Blair finalising the Good Friday agreement, he grasps the value of constructive ambiguity. The language of diplomacy is necessarily elastic, so things may be presented in different ways to different audiences.
Whether Brexit or Bremain, fear will triumph over fear | Timothy Garton Ash Read more
In politics, as in life, the alchemy of deals has as much to do with momentum, linguistic creativity, impatience and exhaustion as it does with content. In a negotiating process, there is a point where everyone has been marched to the top of the hill, and the idea of marching back down again with nothing achieved remains conceivable – but no more.
Since launching this strategy four years ago, Cameron has played the part of the man wrapped in the union flag determined to squeeze a better deal from Europe, ready, if all else fails, to countenance departure. But that act is wearing thin. This prime minister is a clubbable man who relishes his seat at top table and does not happily leave any inner sanctum. He is also a master of the arts of political theatre, and knows that he must soon – perhaps very soon – change persona, adopting the mask of the campaign leader rather than the Brussels wheeler-dealer.
Brexit is but one of the dragons that the EU oligarchy must slay. Alongside the growing recognition that the EU’s institutions, as presently constructed, are failing to match the extraordinary challenge of 21st-century population mobility, elections loom next year for Angela Merkel and François Hollande. None of Cameron’s counterparts want the horse-trading to last much longer.
So there is now a clear timetable for the UK referendum, and one that weighs heavily on all the key protagonists in the negotiations. For Cameron, all else is now subordinate to this enterprise. On Friday, he held a hastily scheduled meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president (whose appointment he so vigorously opposed in 2014).
On Sunday Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, was his dinner guest at No 10: a private curtain-raiser for the proposals that Tusk is expected to publish shortly. If they provide an acceptable framework, the deal will be signed off (in theory) at the EU summit on 18 and 19 February – or possibly at a separate gathering, dedicated to the prevention of Brexit. The referendum itself would then be held on 23 June.
Whatever Cameron squeezes out of his EU counterparts will be dismissed by the various “out” campaigns. Juncker could agree to copy out Magna Carta in his own handwriting, declare that the only good thing to come out of Brussels since the Schuman Plan in 1951 is sprouts, and apologise individually for every allegedly banned straight banana – and Nigel Farage would still say that the PM was “selling out” the nation.
More psychologically intriguing is the likely response to a deal of the in camp, presently gathered under the umbrella of Britain Stronger in Europe. There has been much coverage of the strong personalities engaged in the fight to leave the EU. But consider the oddity of the position in which most of the in camp’s leading figures, such as Danny Alexander, Peter Mandelson, and Brendan Barber, now find themselves. Many of them are lifelong champions of the EU, embattled defenders of common sense (as they see it) against the foghorn of the Eurosceptic press and the Tory party’s entrenched hostility to the EU. And now they await the return of a Conservative prime minister from the negotiations he himself forced so that he may lead the campaign to win a referendum some of them privately believe is a terrible mistake and a colossal gamble.
Never forget that Cameron, like almost every Tory of his generation, is a Eurosceptic to his fingertips, a Conservative who instinctively believes the EU to be (as he said in 2014) “too big, too bossy, too interfering”. Yes, he charged his party to stop “banging on” about Europe. But that was about winning votes, and sharing the electorate’s priorities, rather than a thaw in the Tory approach to the EU.
Indeed, Cameron’s trajectory led in precisely the opposite direction. In the 2005 leadership contest, he won the support of many on the right by promising to pull Tory MEPs out of the European People’s party (EPP), the principal centre-right grouping in the European parliament. Four years later he kept his promise, withdrawing his MEPs from the EPP and forming a new anti-federalist bloc, the European Conservatives and Reformists. In December 2011, to the fury of his coalition deputy, Nick Clegg, he “vetoed” a deal to reform the euro. In the same year his government passed the European Union Act, mandating that a national referendum be held whenever the EU threatened to encroach significantly upon UK sovereignty. Yet it was never enough for his querulous backbenchers. They hated coalition, and Clegg.

And they were furious that Cameron’s “cast-iron guarantee” to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty had been rendered null and void when it entered EU law. He and George Osborne had also concluded that the eurozone crisis was an opportunity to be exploited: as the third-biggest net contributor to the EU, Britain was in a decent position to demand renegotiation of its membership terms as the price for its cooperation with the institutional measures taken to safeguard the single currency. If the matter was to be put to people, the question had to be “in or out?”. All else would be evasion, so many years after the 1975 referendum. That, at least, was the logic that underpinnedCameron’s Bloomberg speech in January 2013 promising a vote on Brexit before the end of 2017.
We do not yet know which politician will lead the out campaign. But – barring a historic upset – it will be Cameron who heads the opposing team. Like a quick-change artist, he will ditch the outfit of a hard-nosed Eurosceptic negotiator and present himself afresh as an enthusiast for the new EU and Britain’s place in it. He has to persuade the voters that they absolutely must remain part of a continental alliance about which he has been at best extremely critical and at worst downright dismissive.
There are those who see this as a potential advantage to the in camp, on the basis that the default position of the British people is essentially that of an instinctive Eurosceptic who is nonetheless unwilling to risk exit from the EU fold. But there is also scope for confusion, not to mention cognitive dissonance: why is this pro-EU campaign being led by a politician who patently dislikes what he is defending? Will the in camp be a broad church or a Babel? We’ll know soon enough. Prepare to step through the looking glass."

We asked those who headed north if the grass really was greener
In November 2004, David Drucker and his wife Pam were at home listening to NPR when they heard the news that would change their lives: George W Bush had been re-elected as president of the United States.

In the lead-up to election day, the couple had made a pact: if John Kerry won, they would build their dream house in Vermont; if he lost, they would move to Canada. A year later, they were on their way to Vancouver to start their new lives.
“It’s been a little over a decade now. We have clear eyes about what we did. We have no intention of going back,” Drucker said.
The Druckers were not alone. On election day in 2004, a record-setting 179,000 people visited Canada’s official immigration website, the majority of them Americans. And as anxieties about the outcome of 2016 begin to grow, some Americans are again musing about fleeing to their northern neighbor.
In September, the digital analytics firm Luminoso found about 4% of 4.5 million Donald Trump-related tweets contained threats to leave the country if the billionaire became president. Of those, 25,000 identified Canada as their intended destination. Since then, comedian and Obama “anger translator” Keegan-Michael Key has joined the chorus. Even former USdefense secretary Robert Gates joked about emigrating if Trump took office.
Talking about relocating to Canada clearly is pretty trendy – actually relocating there, not so much. According to the Canadian government, the number of new US immigrants arriving in the country has remained relatively stable – about 9,000 annually – from 2005 to 2014. It might not be the northern utopia of their dreams, but those who have made the move say they have never regretted it.
“If Americans want to live in a country where there is an investment in public education, where people aren’t afraid of going bankrupt because they get sick, and where democracy is taken seriously, they should move, because an alternative exists,” said Tom Kertes, 43, who moved from Seattle to Canada with his now husband Ron Braun in 2007.
Kertes and Braun had been thinking of Canada since the invasion of Iraq and the US government began using “enhanced interrogation techniques” on detainees. But they actually started browsing the Canadian immigration website the night they heard Bush propose a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage during his State of the Union address in 2005. They applied for Canadian permanent residency in 2006 and and now live in British Columbia.
Jim DeLaHunt left an engineering management position with Adobe in California for uncertain prospects in Canada after Bush’s re-election. Leaving behind his country’s penchant for authoritarianism, war and inequality, he says, was the right call.
DeLaHunt, now a tech consultant, misses the scale and ambition of the technology industry in the United States, but says he wouldn’t trade life in Vancouver to go back to it. He and his wife integrated easily into Canadian society, he said, learning how to be “less arrogant and a bit more gentle”, and even picking up local etiquette and speech patterns.
“Canadians say ‘sorry’ a lot more than people in the US do. They thank the bus driver as they get off the bus. In the US, if someone says ‘thank you’ a typical response might be ‘sure’. That seems awfully brusque in Canada. A better response is, ‘No worries.’ There’s little things like that, and if you get those things right you blend in on a day-to-day level,” he said.
Writer Lee Rowan, 63, and her wife, on the other hand, have found Canada to be more similar to the United States than they would like. In 2007 they moved from Ohio, which three years earlier had banned same-sex marriage, to Ontario, one of the world’s first jurisdictions to legalize it. But in the Waterloo region, where they settled, their neighbors turned out to be more conservative, and less tolerant, than they had hoped.
“I’d say there’s some Canadian homophobia. If we had kids or had been churchgoers I doubt it would have been an issue,” Rowan said.
Watching Trump’s rise, in particular, has been disconcerting to Rowan. Still, she’s keeping an eye on the political climate in the US. If the conditions are right, she says, she would consider moving back.
For Laura Kaminker, however, that’s completely out of the question. In the 20 years before she and her partner Allan Wood finally moved to Canada from New York City in 2005, she had “lost hope” in the country she saw plagued by “civil liberties crackdowns” and “endless wars”. Although she still has her American citizenship, she doesn’t vote any more in US elections, and whenever she comes back to Canada after visiting family or friends in the States, she breathes a sigh of relief.
“Every time I say, ‘God, I’m so glad to be out of that crazy country,’” she said."

Former radio star Jian Ghomeshi will appear in Toronto’s Old City Hall courtroom on Monday for the first trial to emerge from a barrage of accusations that the disgraced celebrity subjected multiple women to violent acts of sexual assault.
The accusations stunned millions of fans of the popular folk artist turned radio personality and his hugely popular program with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Q. The culture and current events show loomed large in Canadian entertainment and attracted a substantial following in the US. Ghomeshi, at once an engaging and an easygoing interviewer, attracted a broad range of guests: Jon Stewart, Paul McCartney, Jay-Z, Michael Moore, Werner Herzog, Wu-Tang Clan’s GZA, and Brian Wilson. His show was one of the CBC’s most successful.
Accusations against the celebrity host burst into public view in late October 2014. On 26 October, the Toronto Star published disturbing accounts from three unnamed women who claimed Ghomeshi had attacked them on dates.
The women told broadly consistent stories of abuse. Ghomeshi started out sweet and flirty but soon alluded to “violent sex acts”. “When they failed to respond or expressed displeasure, they recalled Ghomeshi dismissing his remarks as ‘just fantasies’, reassuring them he wouldn’t ask them to do anything they weren’t comfortable with,” the Star reported.

Ghomeshi eventually slapped, punched, bit, choked, or smothered them, the women claimed. One of the women said Ghomeshi choked her almost to the point of unconsciousness. Another said she struggled to breathe as he covered her nose and mouth.
A fourth woman, who was employed at the CBC, claimed Ghomeshi touched her buttocks at the office and told her: “I want to hate-fuck you.” She reported his actions to her union, which made the CBC aware of her complaints. The employee, who later allowed press to publicly identify her as former Q staffer Kathryn Borel, says she quit the radio show because of CBC’s lackluster response.
The report, which was the product of a months-long investigation, followed three days of turmoil among higher-ups at the CBC. Ghomeshi had told network executives about the possibility of a news article that he claimed would distort his private life. On 24 October, the network announced that Ghomeshi was taking an indefinite leave of absence “to deal with some personal issues”. Two days later, and just hours before the Star story was published, the CBC announced that it had fired Ghomeshi because of “information” that “precluded” employing him further.
Ghomeshi was quick with a public response to his firing. In an emotional Facebook post that has since disappeared, he accused “a jilted ex girlfriend” of falsely portraying their rough but consensual sex as abusive to members of the media. Ghomeshi informed the CBC that “someone was reframing what had been an ongoing consensual relationship as something nefarious”, he wrote, and showed executives evidence of consent. It later came out that Ghomeshi had showed them video of a bruised woman, evidently injured with a broken rib, whom he said he had dated. He said the injuries were from consensual activities.
In his post, Ghomeshi claimed the network fired him because the behavior was unbecoming and any news story could give the impression of abuse. “Let me be the first to say that my tastes in the bedroom may not be palatable to some folks,” he wrote. “But that is my private life … And no one, and certainly no employer, should have dominion over what people do consensually in their private life.”
The Star report followed later that day.
The next few weeks brought a surge of similar allegations against Ghomeshi. Within days, four more alleged victims had identified themselves to the press or police. Within a month, the accusers numbered more than twenty, including several who agreed to make their identities public. Numerous women and one man accused Ghomeshi of behavior that ranged from forceful groping and unwanted touching to punching and choking. Several accusers said he punched or choked them without warning. The incidents allegedly took place between the years of 1988 and 2013 – dating to his time in college and his career as the frontman for Moxy Früvous, a beloved pop-folk band.
“I was surprised by how violent the allegations against him were,” Jim Hounslow, an employee of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg and one of Ghomeshi’s accusers, told the Guardian. “But I wasn’t shocked by how many. I was really expecting more allegations to come out.”
Ghomeshi sued the CBC for $55m the day after his firing. He withdrew his lawsuit a month later following an undisclosed agreement with the network.
On 26 November, Ghomeshi turned himself in to Toronto police and was charged with four counts of sexual assault and one count of “overcome resistance” by choking. Ghomeshi was released on bail. Prosecutors added three more charges of sexual assault in January, and dropped two in May, citing a likelihood that they could not secure convictions.
The remaining charges stem from accusations by four different women. Only one of the women has shared her name with the public: Lucy DeCoutere, an actor on the TV comedy Trailer Park Boys. DeCoutere met Ghomeshi at a TV festival and went on a date with him in 2003. The two were kissing at his house, she has said, when he turned violent. “He did take me by the throat and press me against the wall and choke me,” DeCoutere said. “And he did slap me across the face a couple of times.”
On Monday, Ghomeshi will face the first of two criminal trials before the Ontario court of justice, for the choking charge and four counts of sexual assault. Ghomeshi has pleaded not guilty to all counts. His attorney did not respond to requests for comment.
A test of the legal system

As the Ghomeshi case moves into the trial phase, observers are wondering where it will fit into Canada’s troubled history of handling sexual assault cases.
The accusations against Ghomeshi have renewed attention to the barriers and stigma facing those who make allegations of sexual violence. Many of the women who came forward, for instance, accused Ghomeshi of assaulting them ten or twenty years ago. They said they didn’t feel law enforcement would act on their complaints. Several said they were afraid to be named. Those women cited a 2013 piece by Carla Ciccone on the website XOJane, describing her “bad date” with a radio host who touched her despite her objections. Ciccone did not identify Ghomeshi by name. Still, legions of his fans singled her out for vitriolic harassment on social media.
At least one Ghomeshi accuser was motivated to come forward by all that fear. Hounslow, who met Ghomeshi when the two were York University undergraduates, said he told the Toronto Star about his own alleged abuse out of a hope that he could encourage others to come forward. The two worked together in student government. Hounslow claimed that one night as they waited for an elevator, Ghomeshi grabbed his genitals and fondled them.
“I wanted to be supportive, to encourage others to come out,” Hounslow told the Guardian. “I also wanted to show that [Ghomeshi] had a history of assaulting people who worked with him … There was a long history of this behavior.”
Law enforcement in Toronto seemed to move quickly and effectively at the first sign that Ghomeshi could be a serial sex offender. In an unusual move, the chief of police invited victims to make formal complaints.
But the Canadian courts bear a long history of brutal cross-examinations of women claiming sexual assault. Appellate courts have repeatedly restrained trial judges from intervening in cross-examination, said Janine Benedet, a law professor at the University of British Columbia.
“In sexual assault cases, there has been a really troubling history of defense counsel resorting to what are often impermissible inferences – trying to bring in sexual history without proper application, trying to rely on the fact the complainant didn’t disclose right away, or should have fought back,” Benedet continued.
Indeed, news reports have noted that many of Ghomeshi’s accusers maintained contact with him or waited long periods of time after the alleged abuse to report to law enforcement. These are normal behaviors for victims of abuse that can nevertheless appear to undermine their stories.

Beyond the courtroom, the accusations have prompted scrutiny of Ghomeshi’s former employer. As early as 2012, CBC management received repeated complaints of inappropriate workplace behavior.
Several former and current CBC employees have said the network did little to act on those reports. The summer before Ghomeshi’s accusers went public, a network executive had conducted an investigation into his conduct that found no evidence of wrongdoing.
In January 2015, however, CBC put that executive, Chris Boyce, and Todd Spencer, head of human resources, on leave. That May, investigators commissioned by CBC released a report that excoriated upper management for mishandling complaints as Ghomeshi’s star rose. CBC announced that it would end its relationships with Boyce and Spencer. In March, the CBC announced that it would replace Ghomeshi with the rapper Shad.
The allegations fractured a wide circle of friends, artists, and admirers who surrounded Ghomeshi and resulted in a sometimes vicious debate about the women’s credibility. Many immediately used social media to insist on his innocence. Others were vocal about their belief in the victims. “Jian is my friend,” Owen Pallett, an indie musician, wrote in a Facebook post. “But there is no grey area here.”
Ghomeshi has maintained his innocence since the first of the allegations in 2014 and repeatedly suggested that any contact he had with his accusers was consensual. At one point, his attorneys told the Star that messages between Ghomeshi and a woman he believed to be a Star source would prove that all their contact was consensual, but they declined to share the messages.
Just before he was charged, Ghomeshi added the prominent defense attorney Marie Henein to his team of attorneys. Henein, whom former clients have described as “my shark” and a person who “seemed to channel Hannibal Lecter”, has a reputation for ruthlessness. To many, the choice signals that Ghomeshi’s accusers will face ferocious cross-examination.
Hounslow, who accuses Ghomeshi of assaulting him as a student, will be following the trial. But he thinks about the tidal wave of accusations less than he did last year.
“I just felt sickened for a couple of weeks,” he recalled. “Nauseous and worried about the people I knew who had dated him.” But as more women came forward, his worries turned into empathy and admiration. “Some of them are just very brave to put their names and faces out there in connection with these charges,” he said. “I felt it was all very cathartic.”"

First the army came for the men. Fifteen Mayan peasant leaders in the tiny hamlet of Sepur Zarco in eastern Guatemala were seized and killed or forcibly disappeared.
A few weeks later, they came back for the women. Soldiers raped them in front of their children, burned down their houses and crops, stole their meagre belongings and made them move into shacks outside the nearby military base.
Every two or three days, each woman was made to report for 12-hour “shifts” at the base where they were forced to cook, clean and submit to systematic rape, often by several soldiers.
It was 1982, one of the bloodiest years of the country’s civil war as counter-insurgency operations against ethnic Mayans intensified under the rule of the military dictator and evangelical Christian, Efraín Ríos Montt.

More than 30 years later, two former military officers will finally face charges of sexual and domestic slavery and forced disappearance in a landmark trial which opens on Monday.
The trial marks the first in the world that sexual slavery perpetrated during an armed conflict has been prosecuted in the country where the crimes took place.
The two defendants, former base commander Esteelmer Reyes Girón and former regional military commissioner Heriberto Valdez Asij, are accused of crimes against humanity, which are exempt from the country’s post-war amnesty law.
Throughout Guatemala’s 36-year conflict, state security forces used rape as a weapon of terror, according to the 1999 report of a UN-backed Truth Commission, but no officers have ever faced charges of sexual violence.
And while the plight of Korean and Filipino “comfort women” forced into sexual slavery by Japanese troops during the second world war remains the subject of high-level diplomatic disputes, victims of similar crimes in Guatemala have had little or no official support.
“The women have worked with an amazing coalition of organizations over years to build the case in an effort to overcome the stigma and break the silence that so often accompanies sexual violence in armed conflict,” said Jo-Marie Burt, political science professor at George Mason University and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America (Wola).
The Sepur Zarco crimes took place during the presidency of Ríos Montt, who in May 2013 was found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity – a verdict controversially overturned by the constitutional court just 10 days later. Montt and his co-accused are currently awaiting retrial.
Guatemala’s 1960-1996 civil was triggered by a CIA-backed coup after a democratically elected president promised land reforms. Ríos Montt justified the state-sponsored violence by claiming the victims were communist guerrillas. But army actions were largely about protecting the interests of rich landowners.

In Sepur Zarco, Mayan Q’eqchi’ peasant leaders had angered local landowners by fighting for the legal titles to the land upon which they had lived and worked for years. The landowners called in the army for protection.
After the 15 men were illegally detained and disappeared, 11 of their wives were forced into domestic and sexual slavery.
The macabre “shift” system ended after about 10 months. But for some victims, the bondage lasted for as long as six years until the military installation was closed in 1998. During this time, the women were forced to find corn and make tortillas for the soldiers, even though their own children were starving. And the rapes continued.
The other four women fled to the mountains, where they hid for years with no shelter and little food. Many of their children died from hunger or disease.

Bringing the case to trial has been a long and painful process. The victims, now in their 70s and 80s, are frail, illiterate and speak no Spanish, only Q’eqchi’. Most continue to suffer physical and psychological problems as a result of the sexual violence, aggravated by ongoing harsh living conditions.
Because of the victims’ ages and frailty, the judge agreed to pre-trial evidentiary hearings in 2012 so that their testimonies were on record. Just four months later, one of the women died. Five men who were detained and tortured at the Sepur Zarco base are also witnesses.
Reyes faces charges of sexual violence, sexual and domestic slavery, and for the murder of Dominga Coc and her two daughters at base camp. Valdez, who allegedly identified the so-called subversives, will be prosecuted for sexual violence and the forced disappearance of at least nine men.
Both defendants, who have been held in remand since June 2014, deny the charges. The investigation into other alleged perpetrators continues.
“By speaking out and seeking justice the women of Sepur Zarco are writing Guatemalan history, helping us all better understand what happened and why. Let’s hope that the justice system is up to the task,” Burt told the Guardian.
The trial is expected to last 40 days."

The only previous time it was done, rocks, coins and the odd body were revealed
The sound of Niagara Falls’ unmistakable belligerent roar as 85,000 cubic feet (2.4m liters) of water crash down to its rocky base every second quite literally takes one’s breath away.
Niagara falls freezes over - in pictures Read more
But according to plans revealed on Wednesday, for the second time in history the falls may soon go silent. The manmade stoppage will last just a few months.
Two deteriorating, century-old commuter bridges connecting the town of Niagara Falls to the state park islands in the middle of the Falls themselves are in need of repair; a repair engineers and park officials say almost certainly involves diverting water flowing through the American part of the falls to the Canadian side.
The plans – still not finalized and still lacking funding – are being put forward by New York State offices of parks and transportation. They attracted national and international attention when they were first reported in the Buffalo News last week.
The proposal has shocked and excited some residents of the town of Niagara Falls, many of whom were not around the only other time the Falls went quiet.
“The historian in me is excited to witness this,” says Michelle Kratts, a former Nigara Falls historian, who wasn’t yet born when Niagara’s American water was diverted the first time round, in June 1969, for nearly five months.
Newspaper reports from the time say throngs of tourists turned up to watch the event. Coins that visitors had thrown into the falls over the years had to be gathered and taken away by the bucket load.
Two cadavers were also found – one of a man who was later identified, another of a woman whose body was found lodged in between two rocks halfway down the approximate 100ft newly bare fall. Her identity was never discovered.
As grim as the discoveries were, residents say that, if anything, they were surprised the number of bodies found wasn’t greater. That the falls are a destination place for people wishing to end their lives is a painful, open secret locally. Often, bodies are never recovered.
“A lot of people here have witnessed people go in,” says Kratts, referring to people either committing suicide, attempting daredevil stunts, or falling because of lack of caution.
“It’s scary. It stays with you.”
Aside from the tragedies revealed, when it came to the aesthetics of the event, locals remember being quite underwhelmed.
“It was just a lot of rocks,” Rick Lecksell, a Seneca Casino employee who was a teenager at the time, says flatly.
Will the next planned dewatering manage to create positive publicity and enthusiasm? Officials certainly hope so.
At a public hearing organized by New York State Parks and the state’s department of transportation, 100 or so residents, city and state park officials, engineers and members of the press gathered in the Niagara Falls Conference Center for a public hearing on the dewatering plans. Two current options for bridge repair provide for the dewatering to either last five or nine months.
“This is an enormous opportunity,” declared John Percy, the president and CEO of Niagara Tourism and Convention Corporation. “ [The dewatering of the American Niagara Falls] will gain worldwide attention. Tourism will be benefited.”
Percy pointed out that at least one of the two plans being considered involves the American falls being turned off between August and December, a period of the year during which tourism wanes anyway.
People attracted by the lure of witnessing what lies beneath when the falls are halted may end up coming in greater numbers in those “shoulder months” than if the water was still flowing, the thought seemed to go.
In 1969, reports show tourists expressing thrill and amazement at feeling they were part of a unique, historical moment.
Export bar placed on first eyewitness painting of Niagara Falls Read more
But the New York department of commerce still had to get involved to sell it as a “once in a lifetime trip” in order to get excitement levels up and convince potential visitors to still make the trip.
In a similar vein, Percy said he looked forward to working in coordination with state, park and city officials to devise the “right messaging” around the dewatering. He expressed a will to ensure visitors during the water-bare months are given as much access to stripped sites as possible.
Within the community, people seem mostly in favor of the dewatering plans to restore the bridges, but some – including environmentalists and members of the Native American community are far less excited.
In 1969, almost all of the trees on the dewatered riverbanks died of thirst within a month, it was reported.
“There is a part of me that doesn’t like to keep harnessing her,” Kratts says, explaining she thinks of the river as a living thing.
“I go on the side of environmentalists. We have done so much to the river, diverting so much of her for power, electricity,” she says referring to the massive, industrial-scale hydroelectric endeavors that have been consistently using the river’s force, and diminishing it, since the late 19th century.
Neil Patterson, a founder and director of the Tuscarora Nation’s environment program, says there are a few thousand Haudenosaunee people, also referred to as Iroquois, living within 40 miles on the American side of the Niagara Falls, including on the Tuscarora reservation.
“There is a real sense of ownership of these falls regardless of legal title,” he says.
Haudenosaunee people, who have never given up formal claims to the falls themselves, used to live on the river’s shores and believe it is home to a thunder god, making the river an inextricable link to the “the sky world”, he says.
“But the notion of consultation about a place that has historic or cultural importance to indigenous people has not been complete since the dispossession of our territories going back to 1794,” he says, describing the dewatering as “another action in the colonization of water”, which has been going on for centuries.
Patterson points out that part of the appeal of the area for tourists from around the world is its Native American characteristics – peoples and traditions that have slowly, consistently and increasingly been marginalized, silenced, suffocated.
Once a booming industrial and tourist destination town, Niagara Falls, New York, is currently home to just 50,000 people, a quarter of whom live below the poverty line. It’s a depressed combination of casino lights, chain hotels, and neglected, sometimes boarded-up housing. In the winter months, calling it a ghost town is no stretch.

At least 18 people, including three minors, were killed in shootouts in northern and southern Mexico over the weekend, state authorities reported.
In the border city of Matamoros, a string of armed encounters between gunmen and security forces left eight dead and terrified residents, and in the southern state of Guerrero, at least 10 people were shot dead after an argument at a 15-year-old’s coming-of-age party erupted into violence.
Meanwhile, national security commissioner Renato Sales on Monday announced the arrest of the presumed leader of the remnants of the Beltran Leyva drug cartel, which has fragmented in recent years after the capture or killing of its principal capos.

Seven of those killed Sunday in Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Texas, were presumed criminals, according to a statement from the government of Tamaulipas state. The eighth fatality was a 13-year-old girl who was at a crowded shopping mall with her family and was caught in the crossfire. The statement said she was struck by a bullet fired by one of the suspects.
The violence began in the afternoon with a traffic stop in which the occupants of an SUV with Texas license plates allegedly opened fire on authorities, and three suspects were killed. Authorities seized weapons, ammunition and packets of marijuana hidden in a suitcase.

That unleashed a series of chases and shootouts elsewhere in the city, as suspected criminals blocked roads with buses and other large vehicles to try to impede the movement of police and soldiers.
In the second incident, state agents shot dead three armed men who were traveling in two SUVs. More weapons were seized.
A group of suspects fled from there to the mall, where another firefight broke out with Mexican soldiers, and the girl and another gunman died.
Matamoros is a stronghold of the Gulf drug cartel, which operates in most of northern Tamaulipas.
In Guerrero, another hotspot of violence, at least nine people were shot dead at the end of a private gathering in the municipality of Coyuca de Catalan, state prosecutors reported.
As the quinceañera, or coming-of-age party, was winding down Saturday, an argument broke out that escalated from words to weapons. Two of the dead were identified as 16- and 17-year-old boys.
In a separate attack on a couple in Coyuca de Catalan, gunmen killed a woman, prosecutors said.
Sales, the National Security commissioner, said alleged cartel boss Francisco Javier Hernandez Garcia was detained Saturday in the northern state of Sinaloa.
He added that Hernandez started as a bodyguard for members of the Beltran Leyva family, which founded the eponymous drug gang, and later rose to control cartel operations in three northern states."

British Columbia is set to announce a historic agreement to protect a vast swath of rainforest along its coastline, having reached a deal that marries the interests of First Nations, the logging industry and environmentalists after a decade of often-tense negotiations.
The agreement to be announced on Monday will see roughly 85% of forest within the Great Bear rainforest protected, with the other 15% available for logging under the “most stringent” standards in North America, environmental groups involved in the talks said.
The Great Bear rainforest is one of the world’s largest temperate rainforests and the habitat of the spirit bear, a rare subspecies of the black bear with white fur and claws. It is also home to 26 Aboriginal groups, known as First Nations.
“Under this landmark agreement, more old and second-growth forest will be protected, while still ensuring opportunities for economic development and jobs for local First Nations,” said Premier Christy Clark in a statement.
The province will introduce new laws to support the measures later this year.
The Great Bear rainforest, which includes forests, waterways and mountains, covers 6.4m hectares (16m acres) of the province’s coast. More than half its surface is forest, including 2.3m hectares (5.7m acres) of old-growth forest, which store high levels of captured carbon.
In the 1990s, frustrated over what they saw as destructive forestry practices on their traditional lands, First Nations partnered with environmentalists to fight back against logging companies, blockading roads and protesting.
By the early 2000s, environmental groups and industry players, including Interfor Corp, Western Forest Products Inc and Catalyst Paper Corp, had started talks. At the same time, government began negotiating with the Coastal First Nations and Nanwakolas Council.
The final agreements, reached more than a decade later, will “help mitigate climate change, support improved community wellbeing, and provide economic certainty to the forestry sector”, environmental groups that engaged in the process said.
The deal will also see the end of the commercial grizzly bear hunt within Coastal First Nations territories, though other existing tourism-related businesses will not be affected.
“This full implementation of the Great Bear Rainforest agreements is one of the most visionary forest conservation plans on earth,” said Valerie Langer, ForestEthics Solutions director, in a statement.
“It is a principled approach that sets a new legal and science-based standard for sustaining healthy forests.“
The announcement will come nearly two years after a landmark decision by Canada’s supreme court that granted title to a vast swath of British Columbia’s interior to First Nations, who had gone to court to stop logging in their traditional lands.
The Tsilhqot’in Decision, named for the bands involved, has bolstered First Nations across the province, who now have a legal precedent for fighting development on their traditional territories."

The first witness at the sexual assault trial of Jian Ghomeshi has described how the former radio star appeared to be a “perfect gentleman” before pulling her hair and striking her on the head on two separate occasions.
“It felt almost like a rage, [in] that it wasn’t there the second before he did it,” the woman told a packed Toronto court on Monday, at the start of the first trial to result from a string of sexual assault allegations against the Canadian radio celebrity.
Trial of ex-radio host Jian Ghomeshi begins for series of sexual assault claims Read more
Ghomeshi faces three charges of sexual assault and one count of overcoming resistance by choking. The choking count carries the steepest penalty, with the possibility of years in prison. A fourth sexual assault charge is the subject of a separate criminal trial due to begin this summer.
The charges represent accusations by four women. But nearly 20 individuals have come forward to law enforcement and media to accuse the former CBC star of violent sexual abuse. Ghomeshi denies all the charges, saying that any sexual activities with the women were consensual.
Ghomeshi’s first accuser said she met Ghomeshi in late 2002, and went on two dates with him marked by escalating violence. For the first date, the two spent a half hour at a pub across the street from the set of Ghomeshi’s CBC TV show, Play. Afterwards, he drove her to her car.
She was charmed, she said, that he drove a yellow Volkswagen beetle.
“I remember thinking he’s funny, he’s charming, he’s intelligent, he opens doors,” the woman testified. “I thought he’s a perfect gentleman. I thought, what a nice guy … He’s driving a car that reminds me of a 1960s Disney movie … I’m feeling very safe with him at the moment when I’m with him.”
The two briefly kissed in the front seat, she said, when without warning, Ghomeshi yanked her head back with a violent tug of her hair. “It was painful and sudden,” she testified.
“He said something along the lines of, ‘Do you like it like that?’ And I don’t like that.” Ghomeshi made a “switch back” to his sweet demeanor, she said. She got into her own car not long after, she testified, wondering if he realized his own strength.
Their second one-on-one encounter, in the first week of January 2003, began when the woman and a friend attended another taping of Ghomeshi’s show, she testified.
After her friend went home, she and Ghomeshi went to his home in South Riverdale. The two flirted and kissed until Ghomeshi moved behind her and jerked her hair with force that brought her to her knees. He punched her in the right side of her head three times, she testified, with what felt like a closed fist.
“I’m terrified, I don’t know why he’s doing this. I don’t know if he’s gonna stop, can I take this pain? And my ears are ringing, and I thought I’m going to faint.” As she began to cry, Ghomeshi called her a cab and ordered her to leave, she said. She did not report her allegations to police until fall of 2014.
The accusations against Ghomeshi, which first emerged in fall 2014, stunned fans of the popular folk artist turned radio personality and his hugely popular program with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Q.
The culture and current events show was one of CBC’s most successful programs, looming large in Canadian entertainment and attracting a substantial following in the US. Ghomeshi drew in a broad range of guests: Jon Stewart, Paul McCartney, Jay Z, Michael Moore, Werner Herzog, Wu-Tang Clan’s GZA and Brian Wilson.

Ghomeshi’s celebrity status makes this one of the most-anticipated trials in North America. But the trial is also being scrutinized in the context of Canada’s troubled history of handling sexual assault cases.
Victims’ advocates will be scrutinizing treatment of Ghomeshi’s accusers, especially by the prominent defense lawyer Marie Henein who is leading Ghomeshi’s team. On Monday, an overflow room held several criminal defense lawyers who came to watch Henein’s cross-examinations.
Already, the proceedings have reflected the broad questions about sexual assault that are swirling around the trial, with the prosecution’s first witness saying that stereotypes about accusers prevented her from going to the police with her accusations more than a decade ago.
“It just didn’t seem like anyone would do anything about it, or listen, or care,” she said. “I didn’t create the stigma about reporting sexual assault. But I am very aware.”
Henein hastened to cut off her statement. Before the court broke for lunch, Henein had begun to ask the woman pointed questions about how briefly police questioned her complaint of sexual assault, her media appearances to discuss her alleged assault, her level of excitement after a first date to see Ghomeshi again and her age.
“I think you would agree with me that you were a mature person?” Henein asked.
Henein indicated to the judge that she intended to question the witness about other times she called the police that year to establish “she knows how to pick up the phone and communicate with police”.
The prosecutor’s witness addressed her reticence to call the police in her testimony to the crown prosecutor. After the second alleged assault, she testified, she thought it was “too late” to call the police as soon as she left Ghomeshi’s house.
“It was just easier, I thought, to carry on and try to put it behind me as a bad experience,” she said. “I wanted to go home and curl up in a corner and cry, and the second reason is I didn’t think that anyone would listen.”
For an hour before the court took an afternoon recess, Henein launched an aggressive cross-examination of the witness. At one stage, there was a testy, 20-minute exchange on what caused the witness to misstate that she was wearing hair extensions when Ghomeshi allegedly yanked her hair.
Henein suggested that Ghomeshi did not own the yellow car the witness remembered at the time of their first encounter, and she highlighted inconsistencies between her morning’s testimony and the way she previously recounted her allegations to media and police.
The woman said that her recollections to police and the media did not come all in one burst. “This is new to me,” she said. In one case, “I was on national television. I was under pressure.”
“It was pressure that you chose,” Henein replied.
The case continues."

Brazil, the country at the frontline of the Zika crisis, has admitted it is struggling to comprehend, let alone cope with, the epidemic.
A little more than six months before the country hosts the Olympics, the government has dispatched hundreds of thousands of troops and public officials on mosquito-eradication campaigns to minimise the risks.
But senior officials admit they are still unsure of the scale of the problem they face because the country’s estimate of 1.5m cases is based on guesswork.
“Eighty per cent of the people infected by Zika do not develop significant symptoms,” the health minister, Marcelo Castro, told Reuters on Monday. “A large number of people have the virus with no symptoms, so the situation is more serious than we can imagine.”
His comments came as the World Health Organisation declared a “public health emergency of international concern” due to the apparent link between the virus and a surge in cases of newborns with microcephaly – or small brains.
The WHO director-general, Margaret Chan, said the link between the Zika virus and microcephaly was “strongly suspected but not yet scientifically proven”.
“After a review of the evidence, the committee advised that the clusters of microcephaly and other neurological complications constitute an extraordinary event and public health threat to other parts of the world,” Chan said.
Despite the lack of reliable data, Castro said researchers were convinced the virus had caused the birth defects. Although a link has not been proven, concerns are growing because both the disease and the abnormality have risen sharply.
In an effort to get a clearer picture, Brazilian authorities will oblige local health authorities to report all cases from next week, when most states should have the equipment and personnel to carry out Zika tests. It will also ban people who have the virus from donating blood.
Since October, there have been more than 3,700 confirmed or suspected cases of microcephaly in Brazil, compared with less than 200 the previous year. The Zika virus was identified in fewer than 10 of these cases, but concerns about a possible correlation have prompted the Brazilian government to advise women to consider postponing pregnancies and for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to warn pregnant women not to visit Brazil.
Brazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff, acknowledged last week that the country needs to do more to quell public fears.

“We do not have a vaccine for Zika yet. The only thing we can do is fight the mosquito,” she told reporters during a visit to the emergency headquarters of the anti-Zika campaign. “As long as [the mosquitoes] are reproducing, we are all losing the battle. We have to mobilise to win it.”
On Monday, the president’s office announced sweeping powers for health officials to access any property suspected of being a mosquito breeding ground regardless of whether the owner is at home.
Public health officials, backed by troops and police, have stepped up efforts to destroy breeding grounds of the suspected carrier – the Aedes aegypti mosquito – particularly in the north-east, which is where most cases have been concentrated. Later this month, military personnel will also be dispatched to affected areas in Rio de Janeiro, which will host the Olympics in August."

In other words, to an illegal immigrant.
Anyone who breaches this requirement will be fined up to £3,000 for each illegal immigrant in their property. The only way to be sure of avoiding the penalty is to establish and maintain a “statutory excuse” by checking certain specified documents and keeping copies of them. If those documents demonstrate a right to be in the UK for a limited period only, they must be re-checked periodically.
Right to rent scheme to be extended nationwide from February Read more
However, the government has made little effort to communicate these new obligations to landlords. Even worse, they also apply to people letting a lodger stay in their own home and even to tenants letting a room in their property. In fact, any occupancy by a person who is living there as their main home is captured by the legislation. The level of awareness in these areas is even lower.
The checking process is also complex. A landlord must either see a passport or identity card from a European Economic Area (EEA) country, a passport with a visa showing a right to rent in the UK, an asylum seeker identity card endorsed with a right to rent, or two documents from a list of other options for those who do not have passports. However, even seeing a passport can be uncertain. There are more than 30 types of UK passport currently in circulation, to say nothing of the passports and ID cards from other EEA countries. I have yet to meet a landlord who knows what a Liechtenstein passport should look like. Landlords will need to be able to pick the valid ones from the forgeries.
Currently these provisions only apply in England. The government has suggested that they should apply in the devolved regions, but their governments do not appear to agree. This robs the rules of any effect they may have, as substantial parts of the UK simply don’t have the same restrictions. Any illegal immigrant seeking to avoid the checks can simply rent in Wales, for example.
Where a landlord is not able to confirm a tenant’s status on a re-check then they must report that person to the Home Office. What the Home Office will do about it is yet to be seen. Once a landlord has reported someone it is unclear whether they will be removed from the property, or whether the landlord must continue to let to them knowing that at some stage they will be removed and deported, leaving an empty property behind them.
To add to the uncertainty, the immigration bill currently in parliament will add criminal penalties, including five-year jail terms, to the current fines. The role of landlords on the frontline of immigration control is only just beginning.

Brexit|David Cameron|Donald Tusk|European commission|European Union|Foreign policy|news,2016-02-01T07:16:03,guardian,Rajeev Syal,PM and European council president fail to reach deal over renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with EU before crucial summit,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/31/camerons-hopes-of-early-eu-referendum-dashed-after-talks-with-tusk-break-up,David Cameron's hopes of early EU referendum recede after talks with Tusk,en,politics,,"PM and European council president fail to reach deal over renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with EU before crucial summit
David Cameron’s preferred option of an early referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU edged further away after he failed to broker a deal with the president of the European council, Donald Tusk.
The two men had hoped to finalise a renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with Brussels over dinner at Downing Street so that it could be put to other EU leaders on Monday ahead of a crucial summit in less than three weeks.
An early deal would allow Cameron to call a referendum on the UK’s EU membership before the summer.
But a Downing Street source said that none of the four key areas under negotiation have been agreed. Instead, further negotiations will be left to diplomats or “sherpas” in Brussels on Monday, in the hope that a deal will be put to EU member states on Tuesday.
The No 10 source said that progress had been made, and claimed that Tusk and his team tabled a draft text that makes clear that the UK’s current circumstances meet the criteria for triggering a proposed “emergency brake” on welfare payments to EU migrants.
If given final approval by the EU, this could be used immediately after the vote in a bid to reassure critics it would be effective in slowing the influx of migrant workers.
Deal or no deal? Cameron bid to reform EU hits fresh obstacles Read more
A deal at the next summit on 18-19 February is seen as vital if Cameron is not to run out of time to put the future of the UK’s membership to the public before the summer holidays.
Tusk emerged from No 10 after less than two hours with Cameron and told reporters that there had been “no deal”. He then tweeted: “No Deal yet. Intensive work in next 24 crucial.”
His words were in sharp contrast to remarks he made entering the building, when he said he was hopeful of a deal.
The four key areas which they hoped to agree upon were the protection of the single market for non-euro countries; a deal on competitiveness by setting a target for the reduction of the “burden” of red tape; an exemption for Britain from “ever-closer union”; and restrictions on EU migrants’ access to in-work benefits such as tax credits.
The emergency brake was put forward by Brussels as an alternative to Cameron’s plan to impose a unilateral four-year curb which other member states ruled out as discriminatory and in breach of the freedom of movement principle.
Before the meeting, government sources said the prime minister was prepared to accept it as a “stopgap” measure – on the condition he received assurances it could be triggered by present levels of immigration and could remain in place “long enough to resolve the underlying problem”.
A No 10 source said that the meeting was “productive” but leaves further work. “Progress is still needed in all four areas. On welfare, the commission has tabled a draft text that makes clear that the UK’s current circumstances meet the criteria for triggering this proposed emergency brake.
“This means that the PM can deliver on his commitment to restrict in-work benefits to migrants for four years,” the source said.
The source said that more work must be done on issues of economic governance and on proposals to tackle abuse of free movement such as sham marriages.
The source insisted that while Tusk had said he wanted to circulate a text on Monday, the prime minister had made clear he only wanted that to happen if it addressed the UK’s issues.
Cameron has previously said he is prepared to hold off with the plebiscite - which must be held by the end of 2017 - if he considers the deal on the table to be inadequate.
Before the meeting with Tusk, Cameron met the chancellor, George Osborne, the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, and the home secretary, Theresa May, to discuss the proposals.
May is being wooed by pro-Brexit campaigners who hope she will take advantage of the freedom offered by the prime minister and become a figurehead for the out campaign.

The two leaders met at 6.30pm in No 10 and discussed the proposals over a smoked salmon starter, a main dish of fillet of beef with vegetables and pear and apple crumble.
Monday’s continued negotiations on behalf of the UK government will be conducted by Ivan Rogers, the UK’s permanent representative to the EU, and Tom Scholar, who was formerly chief of staff to Gordon Brown.
Eurosceptics have dismissed the proposals on the table as “pretty thin gruel” that would do little or nothing to stem the flow of would-be workers arriving in the UK, notably from eastern European states.
Steve Baker, co-chair of the anti-EU grouping Conservatives for Britain, said Cameron was engaged in a “synthetic” row with Brussels and dismissed the renegotiation as a meaningless farce."
Ireland|Opinion|First world war|Europe|comment,2016-02-01T08:30:23,guardian,Fintan O'Toole,"A century on, the facts about Ireland’s rebellion in 1916 are finally emerging from the long shadow of myth",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/easter-rising-century-ireland-1916,The terrible beauty of the Easter Rising remains alive today,en,opinion,,"The past is wildly unpredictable. The memory of the Easter Rising, the week-long rebellion in Dublin whose centenary is being marked this year, has long been haunted by an anxious question: is it over yet? The rising can be seen as a foundational event for three political entities: the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and (though this is conveniently ignored) the current United Kingdom, which changed radically when most of Ireland won its independence. Yet the struggle has always been to decide whether it is history or current affairs, something that has happened or a harbinger of something yet to happen, done and dusted or unfinished business.
Contested legacy: echoes of the Easter Rising Read more
As a historical fact, the Rising seems quite small and self-contained. It was a little sideshow to the cataclysmic main event: the first world war. Even in Irish terms, it was, objectively, quite marginal. About 1,600 men and women took some part in the rebellion during Easter week of 1916. By contrast, about a quarter of a million Irishmen fought in the Great War. During the Rising 485 men, women and children (mostly civilians) died in Dublin. In the same week 570 Irish soldiers were killed in a single horrific German gas attack at Hulluch on the western front – an event that is scarcely remembered. The Rising is just a drop in an ocean of blood.
It was also staged by a minority of a minority. The rebels came from two fringe groups, the militantly nationalist Irish Volunteers and the tiny socialist Irish Citizen Army. It was planned and carried out by a faction within the secret conspiratorial Irish Republican Brotherhood. But even most of the militants who believed that an armed rebellion was a good idea in principle did not think that it made sense to go ahead in 1916 without public support and substantial assistance from the Germans.
And as a military adventure the Rising was, of course, a dismal failure. Very little happened outside Dublin, and in the capital the rising was largely a matter of holding a number of public buildings until the British authorities recovered from their shock and assembled the overwhelming force that inevitably crushed it. The Irish Republican Army that emerged after 1916 never attempted to replicate the tactics of Easter week, implicitly acknowledging that they were, from a practical point of view, useless.
So why is this relatively minor disturbance so potent? Precisely because it is so hard to say what it means. It is one of those events that has a protean quality – it continually changes its shape. The most famous lines about the Rising are WB Yeats’s from Easter 1916: All changed, changed utterly / A Terrible beauty is born. But in fact the terrible beauty was not just born: it remains alive. And, like any living thing, it alters over time. Among the things that change utterly and constantly is the meaning of the Rising itself.

Easter Rising 100 years on: share your photos and stories Read more
This was true almost from the start. Many people knew exactly what they thought of it. Mainstream Irish nationalists saw it as tragic folly. Irish unionists, especially in Ulster, saw it as a stab in the back in Britain’s hour of need, final proof that Irish Catholics could never be trusted. But these simple meanings were challenged by much more complex emotions. When the British authorities executed 15 rebel leaders during May 1916 (a 16th, Sir Roger Casement, was hanged in London in August) the public mood began to change. The rebels, instead of being dangerous lunatics, became martyrs. More specifically they became Catholic martyrs. As the rebel leader Patrick Pearse had clearly envisaged, the sacrifice at Easter was folded into the greatest of all blood sacrifices, that of Christ himself.
What happened to the Rising is that it very quickly moved out of the realm of historical fact and into that of the imagination. On the level of fact, for example, the idea of blood sacrifice doesn’t really hold up. The rich archive of statements by rebels yields very few examples of young men and women who thought they were going out to be killed in a hopeless cause – most thought (naively) that they were going to win. And in fact the rebels suffered remarkably few casualties: just 16% of the dead of Easter week were rebels, and most of the casualties were poor slum dwellers caught in crossfire and in British shelling.
As Patrick Pearse envisaged, the sacrifice at Easter was folded into the greatest of blood sacrifices, that of Christ
These facts, though, scarcely matter. Imaginatively, an anonymous kid blown apart by a shell cannot compete with the heartbreaking drama of the great socialist James Connolly being executed by a firing squad while tied to a chair because he was already wounded and could not stand. When, on the 10th anniversary of the Rising in 1926, Seán O’Casey, another working-class socialist, tried to write the slum dwellers back into the story, his play The Plough and the Stars, was greeted by riots. The Rising itself, retrospectively reshaped as a ritual of heroic male self-sacrifice (the women were quickly written out too) is an even more potent drama than O’Casey’s masterpiece. It is gripping, compelling and intensely moving.
Yet this imaginative triumph is also the reason why the Rising generates such anxiety. Facts can be analysed, weighed, placed in perspective. They accommodate complexity and ambiguity. Imaginative happenings make different kinds of demands. They compel us to enter fully into their spirit. So what is the spirit of 1916? In part at least it is the spirit of armed propaganda, the notion that a visionary minority can, without popular consent, stage a symbolic coup that will awaken the slumbering majority to its historic duties. The problem with the Rising is that, even while the Irish state claims it as its foundation stone, its imaginative logic is equally available to violent minorities, such as the Provisional IRA and its even more marginal successors. Far beyond Ireland, the Rising can be drawn on by any armed group to prove that yesterday’s terrorists will be today’s martyrs and tomorrow’s triumphant revolutionaries.
How do we contain this imaginative power? In part by shifting back to facts. So far the commemorations of the Rising have been doing a pretty good job of restoring more complex realities, treating the rebels as neither saints nor terrorists but real political actors in a wider European conflict. It is encouraging that the biggest selling book on the centenary is not a hagiography but Joe Duffy’s painstaking recovery of the names and stories of the 40 children who were killed by rebels or British forces. The context of the first world war, the central role of women and Dublin’s horrendous poverty are all being written back into the story of the Rising.
Welcome as this is, however, facts will not be enough. We have to accept that the Rising will always be imaginatively powerful and to ask, as Yeats and O’Casey did, what exactly it is that we want to imagine. If the Rising is potent because it functions as much as a work of art as a historical event, the glory of art is that it can always be reimagined. The imaginative space that the Rising opens up can be filled with much more than myths of blood sacrifice. It can accommodate too the idea that the rebels themselves imagined: a real republic of equal citizens. That too is unfinished business that makes powerful demands on Ireland’s future."

For 40 years, Paris has carried the shame of an incredible act of architectural self-sabotage. The heart of the city has never fully recovered from the brazen 1970s bulldozing of the magnificent, 19th-century wrought-iron market pavilions at Les Halles and the creation, in their place, of an airless underground transport and shopping complex seen as a monstrous, mirror-glassed carbuncle.
But after decades of cultural spats, protests and political handwringing, the city is finally attempting to make amends. Later this spring, Paris will unveil an entirely reworked Les Halles crowned with one of the most ambitious architectural projects of the decade – a giant, undulating glass roof spanning 2.5 hectares, which hopes to literally put a lid on the problem.

Known as “the Canopy”, the enormous, undulating roof is made up of 18,000 scale-like pieces of glass held in the air by 7,000 tonnes of steel at a cost of over €200m (£150m). It was designed to open up a new panorama across the city centre.
As the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, toured the structure amid the rush to finish work on the €1bn refurbishment before the opening in April, she vowed that the area she once described as an “urban catastrophe” would now become “the beating heart” of the capital.
But a history of errors and regrets still hangs heavy over the site.
Designers prepare Les Halles for a facelift Read more
In the mid-19th century, architect Victor Baltard created what was hailed as a masterpiece of wrought-iron pavilions to house the city’s wholesale market, described by Emile Zola as “the belly of Paris”. But the pavilions were bulldozed in the early 1970s. The giant gaping hole that was left there for years was so surreal that the Italian film director Marco Ferreri famously used it as the war-zone backdrop of his zany farce about the last stand of the American cavalry commander, Gen Custer.
The site was turned into a giant transport hub, with a massive intersection of suburban railway and metro lines that serves 750,000 passengers a day. It is Europe’s biggest underground station, teamed with a giant subterranean shopping mall that has a footfall of 37 million people a year.
But until now, the complex was seen as so unappealing and difficult to find your way round that Parisians and tourists kept away if they could. Its reputation for petty drug-dealing made matters worse.
The refit aims to reconcile France with Les Halles by completely overhauling the station and mall, while adding a new stretch of gardens, a library, a new music and arts conservatory, and – most importantly – a unique centre for hip-hop.

For Hidalgo, the hip-hop centre is crucial. The highest number of users of Les Halles come from the banlieues, Paris’s suburbs. Most are young people from France’s diverse social mix, which is not always reflected in the centre of the capital. City hall wanted to include them, not push them away. Les Halles has always been a site of spontaneous hip-hop, particularly street dance in the station, so the space will have recording studios, dance studios and arts facilities that amateurs can walk in and use.
“Everyone who uses the suburban train lines, whether they live in Paris or not, should be able to come here and find a place to express themselves,” Hidalgo said. “The idea is that for them, Les Halles will be a place of freedom away from the social constraints of the housing estates.”
Architect Patrick Berger promised it would be a new “gateway to the city” and politely refused to comment on the errors of the past. “For an architect, constraints can become virtues,” he said.
The project iscoming under heavy scrutiny. Some architects and urbanists initially argued that the best option would have been to leave street-level totally open as a vast green space.

Albert Lévy, an architect and urbanist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, told the Guardian: “It seems to me like a megalomaniac project. Was there really the need to build a canopy this costly? It’s debatable. There could have perhaps been something lighter, more discreet, less costly and more in the spirit of Baltard – whom Napoleon III had asked to create a covering for the market as light as an umbrella.”
Donato Severo, an architect and historian at Paris University, said the destruction of the 19th-century pavilions had been “the most violent act against Paris heritage ever committed”. But the city, from that point on, had become extremely cautious about its architectural heritage. “It’s very difficult to imagine that scale of destruction today,” he said.
He felt the biggest challenge now was to create a fluidity to Les Halles, to make it easier to walk around and less bewildering.
“Ultimately,” he said. “This is an attempt to heal a wound that never closed.”"

The giants of French gastronomy have paid tribute to the French-Swiss chef Benoît Violier, who was found dead at his home on Sunday.
He died of shotgun injuries in what was believed to be a suicide.
Violier, 44, ran the Restaurant de l’Hotel de Ville in Crissier, near Lausanne, which was named the best in the world in December by La Liste. In 2013 he was named chef of the year by the influential Gault et Millau guide, second only to the Michelin guide among gourmets. He was due to attend the unveiling of the new Michelin guide in Paris on Monday.
Marc Veyrat, a three-star chef, said he was “destroyed” by news of Violier’s death. “The planet has been orphaned by this exceptional chef,” Veyrat wrote on Twitter.
Marc Veyrat (@marcveyrat) La planète est orpheline de ce Chef d'exception, Benoît Violier. Je suis anéanti.
Pierre Gagnaire, also a three-star Michelin chef, who was named by his peers the “biggest star chef in the world” and who has restaurants in Paris, Tokyo, Dubai, Moscow and Berlin as well as Sketch in London, added: “Terribly sad news for an extremely talented chef.”
Pierre Gagnaire (@PierreGagnaire) Mes pensées vont à la famille de Benoît Violier. Une bien triste nouvelle pour un chef extrêmement talentueux...
Paul Bocuse, named “chef of the century” by Gault et Millau and the Culinary Institute of America, said: “A grand chef, a grand man, a gigantic talent.”
Paul Bocuse (@PaulBocuse) Grand chef, grand homme, gigantesque talent. Toutes nos pensées vont vers la famille et les proches de Benoit Violier.
Fredy Girardet, a friend of Violier and his wife Brigitte, and another three-star titan of Swiss haute cuisine, who had previously run the Crissier restaurant, said he was “completely stunned”. He told the Tribune de Genève: “I can see no motive for such an act. He was a brilliant young man, with enormous talent and an impressive work potential. He gave the impression of being perfect. This news is so sad.”
Violier’s death came hours before the gastronomic bible Michelin, the oldest European hotel and restaurant guide whose star rating can make or break a restaurant, was due to unveil its 2016 edition.
While a Michelin star can bring glory, the pressure to maintain the rating is intense. A maximum of three are awarded.
In 2003, the competitive world of French cuisine was shocked by the suicide of the three-star chef Bernard Loiseau, 52, who had been distraught about criticism of his restaurant La Côte d’Or in Burgundy, and rumours that he would lose his third star.
Veyrat closed one his restaurants, the highly rated Auberge de l’Eridan in Annecy, which had been awarded three stars since 1995, “for health reasons”.
Violier had succeeded chef Philippe Rochat at the Crissier, who died in July 2015 after falling ill while out cycling.

In an interview with Swiss TV RTS in December 2014, Violier said the stress of haute cuisine was necessary to maintain standards.
“It’s my life. I go to sleep with cooking, I wake up to cooking,” he said. Last year he was hit by the death of his father as well as his “mentor” Philippe Rochat, whom he regarded as a “second father”.
The café at Petersham Nurseries in London received a Michelin star in 2011, but the founder and chef Skye Gyngell tried to have it removed after customers turned up expecting formal dining.

Then the team’s owner hit upon a novel idea – a sponsorship deal with Libya’s unyielding leader
In next year’s NHL draft, the No1 pick won’t be the prototypical teen from Ontario, the Swedish speedster, or pummeling Muscovite. It will be an 18-year-old from Arizona who plays in Switzerland named Auston Matthews. The young phenom has ended up playing in Europe thanks to a combination of outsider hockey status – Phoenix is not exactly a hockeyhot-bed – and the logistics of being born just after the cutoff for last year’s draft.
Europe has long been a haven for North American hockey players. But most players who end up there are looking to continue the dream of making a living playing the sport they love, even if the NHL isn’t calling for them. That’s how Dan Olsen and Bruce Hardy, two Canadians, ended up in Iserlohn, just south of Dortmund in Germany. It was there that, in 1987, their hockey careers would lead them into what amounted to a dystopian version of Slap Shot. Their bankrupt team, ECD Iserlohn, turned to the most unlikely of saviors: Muammar Gaddafi.
From the Olympics to Euro 2016: how to attend the top sporting events Read more
European hockey is a strange place: jerseys are a neoliberal dream of sponsorship patches, and top scorers on each team are marked with gold helmets; there’s a lot of gimmick and schtick that goes into making the sport financially viable as it competes with soccer for attention. Heinz Weifenbach, the owner of ECD Iserlohn, was perfect for this world. A gregarious, mustachioed, cigar-smoking bon vivant who made his fortune in real estate development, Weifenbach had poured his wealth into making Iserlohn one of Germany’s top teams.
Dan Olsen remembers “Heinzy” as full of life, and a man who wasn’t afraid to let the players know what he thought of their play.
“He would come in the dressing room sometimes and if we weren’t playing good, he’d be swearing away in German – and one time he actually came in and pulled a gun out of his pants!”
As wild as Weifenbach was, he had built a solid squad. Bruce Hardy describes him as “one of the most amazing men you’ll ever meet. He loved hockey, he loved Iserlohn, he made sure he took care of his players”. The previous season, with Hardy on the team, they had made the league semi-finals. Things were promising for the new season with a new crop brought in including Olsen. But all was not well, as the club owed the German authorities $3.4m in taxes. With the club unable to pay, the players stopped practicing, and multiple coaches came and went.

Players had heard rumblings of tax troubles with the team in previous years, yet Weifenbach’s tax accountant, known as “Merlin the Magician”, seemed to make the books work every season. Butthen the authorities had caught up to the team. Tax officials began showing up at the players’ apartments early in the morning, demanding to see their contracts with the team, and the declarations of income they claimed they had sent to the players. The forms and contracts were nowhere to be found, having been “taken care of” by Merlin.
As a penalty, players were fine a thousand marks each, and began seizing personal items of value to cover costs. “They took my TV, they took my leather coats, they took my football, my baseball glove, and they thought I had a gold coin, but what it was was the first year the loonie had come out in Canada”, recalls Hardy. Olsen was luckier: new to the team, the authorities didn’t know where he lived.
Needing to act quickly, Weifenbach dreamed up an idea with the mayor of a neighboring Iserlohn suburb to to save the team: fly to Libya and ask Muammar Gaddafi, Libya’s tyrannical leader, to become the team’s patron.
Greeted in Libya by Gaddafi himself, Weifenbach conducted a series of negotiations. Eventually a deal was struck. Gaddafi would give Weifenbach $900,000 for the season to keep his club afloat. Predictably, there was a catch: in exchange for the money, the team must promote Gaddafi’s Green Book – a collection of ramblings and political philosophies of the late dictator – on their jerseys.
This might appear to have come out of the blue, but Gaddafi was connected to sport. He paid Perugia and Sampdoria to carry his son Saadi Gaddafi on the roster, with owners pleading managers to allow the younger Gaddafi on the pitch in hopes of gaining more cash from the family.
Muammar Gaddafi’s connections to Germany were not new, either. Hardy remembers ads for the Green Book appearing on local taxi cabs even before their hockey team’s relationship with the Libyans, and Libyan oil was still being readily imported into Germany.
But Gaddafi was a controversial and menacing figure. In 1986, two years before the Lockerbie bombing, La Belle discotheque in Berlin had been bombed. The US pointed to Gaddafi as the culprit, claiming he targeted a nightclub where numerous US soldiers were spending the evening. Transcriptions were intercepted from the Libyan embassy in East Germany, and Reagan would go on to bomb Tripoli in response.
For Hardy, Olsen, and the rest of the team, however, Gaddafi’s investment brought a sense of relief. They were there to play hockey, wanted to see the team stay together, and were unaware or uninterested in the politics. It wasn’t until the morning before the first game that Hardy would start to realize the situation at hand. Called into the team office after the morning skate, he was told he had a phone call. “This is Tom Brokaw from New York,” said the voice at the other end. Media across the world had picked up on the story. “OK, now this is big time,” thought Hardy.
By the time the Hardy and Olsen returned to the rink for the game that night fans had been whipped into a frenzy. “It was packed. It was a zoo. It was the most amazing atmosphere I’ve ever seen in my life”, says Hardy.
Spurred on by the frenetic support, the team would win their first game under the patronage of Gaddafi, complete with Das Grune Buch emblazoned across their chests. “We sat in the dressing room looking at each other, thinking ‘what just happened?’“
The media and German ice hockey federation, on the other hand, were not amused. Der Spiegel declared Weifenbach’s hockey fiefdom as “Sodom and Gomorrah”, and interior minister Friedrich Zimmermann said: “What at first looked like a carnival joke is a flagrant violation of political neutrality of the sport”.
German national team coach Xavier Unsinn, no fan of Weifenbach for his perceived over reliance on foreign players, would criticize the team further by saying sport should not be associated with criminals and terrorism.
The following week, an away game in Frankfurt, the team was met not with desert-robed fans cheering, but instead protesters and riot police at the charged arena.
“Now we start getting threats … that there’s no guarantee on our lives. ‘You wear those sweaters and you’re in trouble,’” remembers Hardy.
The players, now realizing the magnitude of the situation, decided to take a vote. They could wear the Green Book jerseys and continue to be paid, risking further media scrutiny and possible harm, or play the game in their old sweaters sans Gaddafi and risk their team’s financial collapse. The players voted to play in their old sweaters.
Weifenbach entered the locker room and was told of the results of the impromptu player vote. He told the team he respected their decision and that as such this would be the last game for the team, with the club unable to operate without the money from the sponsorship.
Even without the vote the team would likely still have been doomed. Despite Weifenbach’s claims of the neutrality of the green book and sponsorship the German hockey federation would ban the team from featuring it on their jerseys.
It’s a moment that both players will never forget, but are rarely asked about. Olsen now coaches back in his native Calgary at the South Alberta Institute of Technology, and it wasn’t until Gaddafi’s fall in 2011 that people around him would even know of his connection.
“The president, at work, he googled Iserlohn, and the Muammar Gaddafi stuff came up. He asked, and I sat in his office talking about it, and he was in disbelief!”
Hardy is back in Alberta as well after playing over a decade in Germany, and still has his Green Book patched Iserlohn sweater. Weifenbach and the club would eventually return to the league, albeit minus Gaddafi.
Sports fans continue to grapple with the marriage of money, politics, and the games we love – just look at the Fifa corruption scandal. Weifenbach and ECD Iserlohn serve as a tale of a man who took sport and money to its ideological limits. Well intentioned in saving his club, fancying it his own version of ping-pong diplomacy, he forced fans and society to confront themselves and ask where do we draw the line in the quest to build champions?
Though he died this past year, Weifenbach will continue to be remembered as a cult hero in Iserlohn, and a man who brought about one of the most interesting yet problematic sports sponsorship of all time."

Italian financial police have hailed the discovery of more than 9,000 bottles of fake Moët & Chandon champagne in a shed in the countryside near Padova as one of the most significant seizures of counterfeit bubbly in Europe.
The Guardia di Finanza estimated the illicit loot would have been worth about €350,000 (£266,534), but could have earned the alleged counterfeiters more than €1.8m had they been able to use 40,000 fabricated Moët & Chandon labels that were also discovered.
Police in Padova said an analysis of the supposed champagne revealed it was sparkling table wine.

The seizure happened late last year but was announced on Monday. Financial police in Padova who were examining a separate business happened to come across a bottle of champagne with a label on it that lacked a manufacturing serial number.
The proliferation of counterfeit luxury goods is a known problem for fashion houses such as Prada and Louis Vuitton. But the Padova news signalled it is also a significant issue for the world’s top champagne producers.
In France, the Comité Champagne is tasked with protecting the name “champagne” against counterfeiting and misuse by other entities. On its website, the group says that as part of its anti-counterfeit policy it oversees a global network of champagne bureaus and provides customs authorities worldwide with information on how to distinguish counterfeit products.
The Italian police said eight people with criminal backgrounds had been found in the shed where the fake bottles were being produced. Police also said they found “interesting documentation” after home searches, and that the investigation into the counterfeit bottles was continuing, zeroing in on the source of the sparkling wine and other materials.
The wine itself is not going to waste. Police said that, in accordance with other legal authorities, the bottles had been donated to “associations” working in the Veneto, the home of prosecco, Italy’s answer to French champagne."

Marine salvage experts have successfully towed a stricken cargo ship away from France’s picturesque Atlantic coast.
Local maritime authorities on Monday said a Spanish tugboat had been connected to the ship, which is tilting heavily, “and managed to pivot it, point it towards the open sea and begin towing it”.
The Panamanian-registered Modern Express was 27 miles (44km) from shore when authorities launched a final attempt to attach a tow line and stop it from hitting the coast. Experts from the Dutch company Smit Salvage, which specialises in helping ships in distress, were lowered by helicopter on to the vessel as it tilted at 40 to 50 degrees while being buffeted by large waves.
The ship’s crew sent a distress signal last Tuesday with the vessel listing badly, probably owing to cargo coming loose in the hull. The 22 crew members were evacuated by helicopter as they clung to the ship.
Three earlier efforts to attach the tow line failed, with the cable snapping on Saturday because of the movement of the vessels in the rough seas.
A spokesperson for Smit Salvage said at the weekend: “The difficulty is a combination of several things: the wind, the swell and the angle of the boat which is like climbing a mountain, but which is moving.”
Authorities said earlier that if the vessel could be towed, it would likely be taken to a port on the northern coast of Spain.
The Modern Express was carrying diggers and 3,600 tonnes of timber from Gabon in west Africa to Le Havre in Normandy. If the towing operation failed, the ship would probably have crashed on the coastline of the Bay of Arcachon, where it would have been dismantled or cut up.
With about 300 tonnes of fuel in its tanks, French authorities said the ship presented a limited risk of pollution in the event of a crash, but that a cleanup vessel had been sent to the scene in case."
France rugby union team|Six Nations 2016|Six Nations|Rugby union|Paris attacks|Paris|news,2016-02-01T13:34:51,guardian,Gavin Mortimer In Paris,The biggest security operation at a sporting event in France will be mounted for the rugby game against Italy on Saturday,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/01/france-biggest-security-operation-six-nations-stade-italy,Snipers anchor biggest security operation at France’s Six Nations opener,en,sport|rugby union,,"Snipers, sniffer dogs and extra searches will anchor the biggest security operation seen at a sporting event in the country when France play Italy in their opening Six Nations game at the Stade de France on Saturday.
The match will be the first sporting event to be held at the national stadium since it was targeted by terrorists on 13 November as France hosted Germany in a football friendly. A passer-by was killed when the attackers detonated their explosive vests but the casualties could have been far worse if any of the three suicide bombers had managed to get inside the stadium.
Security at the Stade de France had already been strengthened following the attacks in Paris in January 2015, and it is being increased further. The clampdown will begin when bomb disposal teams sweep the stadium and its environs on Friday; the police presence will be more than doubled for the tournament’s opening game.
The man in charge of the Stade de France operation is Robert Broussard. In the early 1970s he was one of the leading figures in the Brigade de Recherche et d’Intervention, the elite police unit who are in the vanguard of the fight against terrorism.
Broussard, who is 79, has been in charge of stadium security for the French Rugby Federation for the past five years. He faces a challenging couple of months. The match against Italy is followed by Ireland the following weekend and the visit of England on the final day of the tournament on 19 March.
“Our objective is that people will come feeling confident,” he told the Journal du Dimanche, advising those with tickets to arrive in plenty of time to pass through the security checks.
Past rugby internationals at the Stade de France have been overseen by 100 police and 700 security staff and stewards. This Saturday there will be 250 police and 900 security staff, perhaps more if the president, François Hollande, and the prime minister, Manuel Valls, attend.
Hollande was in the Stade de France on 13 November and his presence on Saturday would be highly symbolic. It would also add to the pressure on Broussard but, as befits a former commissioner of police, he is exuding calm confidence. “We want the match to take place in the best conditions and with the same spirit of warmth that one always finds at rugby games, “ he told Midi Olympique on Monday. “One must above all not panic people. So we are confident, calm but also very vigilant.”
While Broussard is in charge of security inside the stadium, outside is the domain of the police. “We’ve moved from a system geared to controlling crowds and hooliganism to a system aimed at stopping terrorist attacks,” said Laurent Simonin, the police chief responsible for securing the area outside the Stade de France.
The three rugby internationals will provide the police with invaluable experience before the Euro 2016 football championship when tens of thousands of supporters from across the continent will descend on France. On Saturday they will cordon off the immediate approach to the stadium with seven lines of staggered barriers where security staff will search spectators and their bags. There will then be a second search at the turnstiles before fans can enter the stadium and take their seats.
Broussard, a lifelong rugby supporter, has written to the Italian Rugby Federation to make them and the Italian fans who will be among the expected 60,000 crowd aware of the security measures. The gist of the message was: “Security is everybody’s affair. In this type of situation the smooth running of an event relies on the good behaviour and understanding of everybody.”"

Despite many British MPs’ strong feelings about the European Union, an Ipsos Mori survey suggests their knowledge of European institutions is not particularly comprehensive.
The majority (61%) of nearly 129 MPs surveyed said they did not know which country currently held the presidency of the council of the EU, which has the power to veto new EU-wide legislation.
At the time of asking in late 2015, the correct answer was Luxembourg, chosen by only 8% of MPs, while 10% thought it was Poland. The Netherlands took on the role at the start of 2016.
When asked what the 12 gold stars on the EU flag represented, nearly three-quarters of MPs incorrectly chose “The 12 nations in the European community when the flag was designed”. Just 7% knew it was a reference to the number 12 being a symbol of perfection, completeness and unity.
Half of the parliamentarians surveyed said they would vote to remain in the EU, while 11% wanted the UK’s exit. The remaining third said they were waiting for the outcome of David Cameron’s renegotiations before making a decision either way.
The bulk of those waiting to see what deal the prime minister reaches are Conservative MPs. However, a fifth of Tory MPs said they would vote to leave regardless, which is almost double the proportion who said they unconditionally supported remaining.
Indeed, when asked what their emotions were about the EU, the two most popular options by Conservatives were “uneasy” (69%) and “angry” (25%). Labour MPs by contrast were “hopeful” (64%) and “proud” (42%).

Prof Anand Menon, director of UK in a Changing Europe, which commissioned the poll, said: “This survey shows, on balance, MPs views are out of sync with the general public’s views on the EU. For most people the EU stirs little to no emotion and it isn’t an issue they are generally concerned about.
“Politicians clearly have a lot of work to do to convince people of the importance of getting engaged with the upcoming referendum and convincing them to come out to vote.”
The latest Ipsos Mori issues index published last month showed that 16% of the public thought the EU/Europe was one of the most important issues facing Britain. This is considerably behind the top two issues: immigration/immigrants (46%) and the NHS/hospitals/healthcare (38%).
Methodology: a representative sample of 129 MPs were interviewed in the poll, which took place between 6 November and 18 December 2015. The research findings were analysed by Prof Anand Menon, together with Prof Philip Cowley and Prof Tim Bale."

What are Britain’s negotiations with the EU all about?
In 2013, David Cameron promised an in-out referendum on Britain’s EU membership before the end of 2017 if the Conservatives won the general election. He is expected to lead the campaign to stay in the EU if he can secure a renegotiation of the UK’s relationship with the EU that he is happy with.
Since the party’s election victory in May, talks between the UK and the rest of the EU have been gathering pace and have now reached a crucial moment. Both sides hope to strike a deal on 18-19 February at a summit of EU leaders.
Cameron has said he wants the UK to remain in a “reformed EU”. Speaking this month on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, he said a British exit was not “the right answer”, but promised that in the event of a vote to leave he would do “everything necessary to make it work”.
What does Cameron want?
He is seeking changes in four areas: limiting in-work benefits for EU citizens working in Britain, stronger protection for countries outside the eurozone, a target to cut EU red tape, and more power for national parliaments to stop unwanted EU laws.
What is the main sticking point?
The most controversial part of the talks is Cameron’s wish to restrict other EU citizens working in Britain from claiming in-work benefits for four years. For the rest of the EU, this amounts to discrimination that flouts the basic principle of freedom of movement. To bridge the differences, the European commission has proposed an emergency brake to stop migration flows if and when welfare systems and public services are under serious strain.
Downing Street has claimed a “significant breakthrough” in the talks because the commission has accepted that current numbers of EU workers in the UK mean the emergency brake could be triggered. But Eurosceptics are rubbishing the emergency brake, because officials in Brussels rather than the British government would decide when to use it.

So everything else is agreed?
The benefits issue has grabbed the headlines, but the UK’s ideas for protecting the rights of non-eurozone countries are also proving contentious. This agenda has been shaped by George Osborne, with the aim of protecting the City of London. He wants to reset the balance of power between the 19 countries sharing the euro and the minority outside the single currency.
In practice, this means official recognition that the EU has more than one currency and a get-out clause on economic policy, confusingly also known as an emergency brake. Countries outside the eurozone could use the economic emergency brake to stop unwanted economic laws, triggering further discussions among EU leaders. But this would require treaty change and several eurozone countries, including France and Germany, are loath to introduce this mechanism when the currency union may need to act fast in a debt crisis. France is insisting that it will not give the British veto powers over the eurozone.
The rest is easy?
The determination of the Conservative party to rewrite the EU’s “ever closer union” motto perplexes other European governments. To allay Eurosceptic fears, EU leaders in 2014 drafted a declaration that “ever closer union” allows for different paths of integration …respecting the wish of those who do not want to deepen any further”. France and Germany are reluctant to go beyond this, but some face-saving formula is expected.
Agreement is also possible on Cameron’s plan to give national parliaments power to block EU legislation, as few governments see it as a game-changer.
Wasn’t there something about so-called red tape?
The final area of negotiations concerns competitiveness and is the least contentious. The European commission has already published plans aimed at simplifying EU regulation, which go some way to meeting Cameron’s demands. All EU countries are ready to sign up to “competitiveness and better regulation”, the most widely used EU buzz words, although governments have very different ideas about what this means in practice. In the short term, these differences can be papered over and are unlikely to stand in the way of a deal.
What happens now?
More talking. Senior officials are meeting on Monday to discuss possible compromises on the British demands. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, is expected to send a draft agreement to all 28 EU member states on Tuesday. The rest of the EU will have a chance to give its response on Friday at talks between senior officials, paving the way for EU leaders to meet in Brussels next week.
What if there is no deal next week?
Cameron is trying to sound relaxed about failure to reach a deal next week: his aim, he said recently, is to hold the referendum before the end of 2017. The prospect of a second EU leaders’ summit in February to nail down a deal has already been mooted. But senior EU officials are wary about the British talks dominating the EU’s agenda while the union struggles to cope with the refugee crisis.
So when is the referendum?
A deal between the UK and the rest of the EU in February would fire the starting gun on the formal referendum campaign. At least 16 weeks is needed to prepare for polling day and the government has pencilled in 23 June. Any delay in reaching agreement would mean holding the referendum in September. This is seen as more risky for the pro-EU cause, as it is likely to coincide with a peak in refugee arrivals, potentially strengthening the leave vote."

Welcoming progress in the talks over the weekend, No 10 denied Cameron was staging a confrontation with EU leaders before delivering a deal at a summit later this month.
“I wouldn’t accept that at all,” the prime minister’s spokeswoman said in response to criticisms from the Vote Leave and Leave.EU campaign groups. “Look at the amount of hard work, time and effort that the prime minister, other senior ministers and indeed senior government officials have had put into this and into making progress. Look at the work we have had to do with a number of other European countries that have raised concerns. These are significant, far-reaching reforms. That is why it is taking time.”
David Cameron's hopes of early EU referendum recede after talks with Tusk Read more
Downing Street spoke out as Donald Tusk, the European council president, who met Cameron over dinner on Sunday night to reach an agreement, prepares to outline a proposed deal in a letter to EU leaders. The letter will be sent on Tuesday if Tusk believes that a deal is possible at the next EU summit on 18-19 February.
A deal has to be reached by the summit or at a special extra summit, which must be held no later than early March, if Downing Street is to be able to call an EU referendum by the preferred date of 23 June.
The prime minister was encouraged when Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, agreed at a meeting in Brussels on Friday that an emergency brake could be imposed to limit benefit payments to EU migrants as soon as a referendum is passed. It is understood that a mechanism proposed by Juncker, which would be set out in the Tusk letter, says that the current levels of migration to the UK would justify the application of the brake.
But Downing Street says the emergency brake would have to be as effective as the prime minister’s original proposal of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits.
Steve Baker, the Tory MP for Wycombe, who is a leading member of the Vote Leave group, has described the brake as a sick joke amid claims that it would be lifted after four years. The prime minister is understood to be pressing for restrictions on benefits to be applied for seven years.
Cameron’s spokeswoman said: “The discussions are ongoing. The prime minister is making very clear that, as he has said throughout, any alternative to four years has to be equally as effective.”
Downing Street played down speculation that 60% of the prime minister’s demands in his EU negotiations had been met. But progress has been made on his call for a new initiative to boost EU competitiveness, for Britain to be given an opt-out from the EU’s historic commitment to create an “ever closer union” and for national parliaments to be allowed to club together to block EU legislation.
Deal or no deal? Cameron bid to reform EU hits fresh obstacles Read more
No 10 indicated that more work was needed on George Osborne’s demands for non-eurozone countries to be given protections from rules drawn up for the single market.
Downing Street says the UK was looking for a watertight “enforcement mechanism”, though not a veto, to allow non-eurozone members to flag up concerns. This could involve contentious legislation being referred to EU leaders on the European council. France is nervous because no member state has a veto over the rules of the single market while each EU leader has a veto on the European council.
More work was also needed to stop non-EU citizens getting access to Britain through “sham marriages”. Non-EU citizens who marry a UK citizen have no automatic right to settle in the UK. But if they marry a citizen of another EU country they can move to the UK under the EU’s rules on free movement.
The prime minister’s spokeswoman said: “We have been clear throughout that this isn’t about the UK being able to veto further eurozone integration. It is about having clear principles and a way to enforce them.”
The prime minister’s spokeswoman said: “On the issue of sham marriages this is to do with abuse of free movement rights. It is about third-country nationals that then may find ways to use EU free movement rights to exploit loopholes. This is an area where we want to secure progress and see the EU taking action to address some of this.”"

In his negotiations over Britain’s future in the EU, David Cameron is trying to give the impression he is on a roll that will allow him to bounce a hesitant and cautious electorate into voting yes to Europe as early as 23 June. I hope he’s right. But did he catch Michael Caine’s interview on Radio 4’s Today programme the other day?
Caine’s performance was wonderful – it usually is on radio and TV because the Tory-voting actor doesn’t have newspapers mediating his views in order to highlight his chippy side. Left to speak for himself, Caine’s self-deprecating humour always shines through, as do his enjoyably chaotic political thoughts.
On this occasion he said he hadn’t made up his mind about the coming referendum and that a Brexit vote would be “scary”. After being a tax exile in the US, Caine came home when Maggie Thatcher cut income tax rates and now lives mostly in Surrey, though he has had tax grief about his former Spanish home. So he can vote – he’s not Sean Connery.
But it quickly became clear on Radio 4 that Caine has made up his mind. He said he didn’t like “being dictated to by thousands of faceless bureaucrats” (etc, etc) and “sort of feels certain” Britain should leave. If it proves a bad move, we’ll all have to work harder until we succeed like he always did, he explained.
But Caine’s muddle is Cameron’s danger. Too many voters may reach the same half-baked conclusion.
Today’s reports that Donald Tusk, the European council president, left his No 10 dinner early last night should come as no surprise. It’s increasingly clear that the PM thinks he can extract enough on his four key packages – perhaps by the end of this week – to face down an opposition that is angry, divided, and already sounding defeatist.
In today’s Guardian, Matthew D’Ancona sums up the hopes of the Tory high command as Dave suppresses his gut Euroscepticism, does a quick change and sells the deal. Clever metropolitan Tories and their pundit allies tend to talk that way. It’ll be all right on the night.
I’m not so sure. That’s what they told each other before the Scottish independence referendum, but it nearly wasn’t and isn’t fixed yet.

On the ConservativeHome website, the cerebral ex-MP Paul Goodman sets out what Cameron originally promised to extract in his negotiations and the vestigial elements that are left. Not much, and the “emergency brake” mechanism for deterring EU migrants via a benefits cap, a device No 10 is busy talking up, looks pretty feeble, even to me.
So do the frontmen for both camps. Here’s the ex-M&S boss Sir Stuart Rose, titular head of the pro-EU camp, making the case on Radio 4’s Today programme and sounding pretty feeble on tone and substance. And here’s Jon Moynihan of Vote Leave, one of the feuding no campaigns, being gently taken apart by Today’s Justin Webb.
The last time Labour’s Alan Johnson made a speech that I spotted, not a word got reported. When Liam Fox, scourge of our armed forces, urges former cabinet colleagues to use their judgment, it’s time to get into the lifeboats. Jeremy Corbyn now says he’ll back Europe, but do we trust Jez to resist mischief making, let alone be of much use? No one so far has shown persuasive leadership on either side.

The Times columnist and global-warming critic Matt Ridley (the George Monbiot of the right – clever and well informed, sceptical, all in the opposite direction), explains here (paywall) that the Leave.EU campaign, funded by the mouthy City money man Aaron Banks, with Nigel Farage on board, is the core no vote, anti-immigrant camp. The more mainstream Vote Leave, run by Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, will probably be designated the official no voice and concentrate on assuring the wavering third of voters, the ones who will decide the outcome, that their jobs and their kids’ prospects will be safer. Caine is their kind of target voter.
Nay, the kids’ prospects will be enhanced as Britain, cut free from the EU ball and chain, becomes “the Japan of the west, only more open”, Ridley writes. An odd vision, given Japan’s 20 years of frantic deflation. But Ridley, the chairman of Northern Rock when it crashed, is an optimist. The risks of staying in and being pushed around by resentful (“you’re now in for good”) Eurocrats is far scarier, he says: “Two can play at Project Fear.”
This strikes me as wishful thinking.
Economic migrants and refugees from war will still head our way after a Brexit. Nor is Europe responsible for giving questionable millions to Kids Company or for the fact that family weekends at Center Parcs cost a lot more in Britain than on the wicked continent. Does Farage ever ask himself why?
Hard though it is for the self-absorbed Nigels to grasp, it’s also not all about us.
Cameron’s EU deal negotiations: the key questions answered Read more
The refugee and migrant crisis grows by the day in all directions, with buckling Greece in danger of being cut off from Schengen membership in the south, Italy on the brink, and Muslim Algeria perhaps poised to implode too. There are left-right clashes in Sweden, which took in 200,000 migrants last year, in Calais and now at Dover. Nice, liberal Denmark voted last week to relieve migrants of their valuables, as a deterrent not a practical policy. The Social Democrats voted for it too. Things are getting ugly.
So everyone is under pressure, not just Cameron. Tusk is a modernising ex-prime minister of Poland, but had other things on his mind over No 10 grub apart from Dave’s party management. Five officials closely associated with his Civic Platform party, including his own chief of staff, are about to go on trial for “negligence” that led to the Smolensk plane crash that killed 96 people, including the then president, Lech Kaczyński, whose brother Jaroslav is the power behind Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party.
Who is making the most impressive running on corporate misconduct in 2016? For once it’s the EU. Beset by problems it fails to tackle, it has in its competition commissioner, Denmark’s former deputy PM Margrethe Vestager, a cool technocrat with steady nerves and pragmatic judgment, nominated for the post by Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Denmark’s Mrs Borgen.
Apple, Gazprom, Google – Vestagar’s office is squaring up to them all over tax and monopolistic practices that threaten the fabric of all our societies. She seems to be doing a better job than the UK Treasury or HMRC, whose unilateral tax deal (“a major success” – G Osborne) with Google did not help.
As Caine would put it: “Not a lot of people know that.” But they should. And so should he. Cameron’s gamble is that waverers will vote for safety first. In the current frightened mood they just might not."
Sweden|Opinion|Europe|Refugees|Migration|comment,2016-02-01T14:48:00,guardian,Christian Christensen,This is a country with a history of accepting refugees in great numbers.

The recent images of young men, wearing hoods and dressed in black, roaming the streets of central Stockholm looking for “north African street children” to “punish” for their mere existence reminded Sweden and the world of the worst elements of European history.
People immediately took to social media to express their shock that this could happen in a country like Sweden. Or, to be more accurate, Sweden as they imagine it to be.
Masked men in Stockholm threaten to 'punish' refugee children Read more
Tragically, these are images the world is accustomed to seeing. But not from Sweden, a country with a global reputation for egalitarianism, the recognition of human rights and support for international justice. With the restriction on the intake of refugees in late 2015, the announcement that up to 80,000 asylum seekers could be returned to their countries of origin, and now the threat of street violence, the image of the country as a bastion of tolerance and progressive politics has been ruined. It’s unclear whether it can ever recover.
When huge numbers of refugees and migrants braved the Mediterranean in search of a better life last year, Sweden took in nearly 200,000 of them. For a nation of 10 million this intake was massive, shaming many larger EU countries that claimed they were not able to help. This magnanimity was held up as a glowing example of the best of Swedish social democracy. While other countries made excuses and procrastinated, Sweden put its money where its mouth was.
And this wasn’t the first time. After Iraq was bombed into the ground a decade ago, Sweden took in huge numbers of Iraqi refugees while the US accepted just a trickle from the country it had destroyed. After the US supported the overthrow of the democratically elected Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973, leading to the brutal Augusto Pinochet regime, it was Sweden that accepted political refugees from that country. The list goes on.
The memory of this history – and the feel-good afterglow of Sweden’s recent humanitarian efforts with the Syrian refugees – has quickly evaporated, replaced by the image of a country no different from its European fellows. That may not be entirely fair (Sweden is still one of the largest per capita foreign aid providers in the world), but – as with many countries – much of Sweden’s image is a mixture of facts, half-truths and mythology.

When the far-right, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats first entered parliament in 2010 with 5.7% of the vote, many described them as nothing more than a one-issue “protest party”. Six years later, they have just over 18%, while the Social Democrats – the party of slain prime minister Olof Palme – languish at 23%, their lowest number since polls began. The thought that there would be just five percentage points between the two parties would once have seemed ridiculous.
This is an existential social and political crisis for Sweden. While the number of gang members searching for “non-Swedes” to attack in Stockholm a few nights ago was only around 100, their actions reverberated around the country, and the world.
Vigilante street violence is disturbing at many levels. It is disturbing because it suggests that clusters of citizens have abandoned their belief in the efficacy of the democratic system, and have decided to take the law into their own hands.
It is disturbing because debate and argument have been abandoned in favour of brute force. And it is disturbing because it suggests the potential erosion of the social and ethical rules by which ordinary citizens operate on a daily basis, and by which large groups of people can live together in the usually tense but occasionally wonderful places we call cities.
This is not the Sweden the world knows. This is not the Sweden many Swedes know. This is a Sweden no one knows."

To all appearances, Benoît Violier, the star French-Swiss chef found dead at his home on Sunday, had everything going for him.
He was recognised and respected by his peers and, at 44 – relatively young in the world of haute cuisine – already a restaurateur of world renown.
Last December, his three Michelin-starred Restaurant de l’Hôtel de Ville in Crissier was named the world’s best restaurant by La Liste, a French-led listing based on a compilation of food guides and reviews. The influential Gault et Millau restaurant guide named him chef of the year.
Le Figaro declared him the “world’s best chef”, a distinction he received with modesty.
Benoît Violier’s apparent suicide highlights pressures on top chefs Read more
“You can set up all the listings in the world … what’s important in the end is the customer,” he said at the time. “It’s the customer who comes back, who judges and who gives the truth.”
Two months before the accolade, his 1,000-page cookery book on hunting, preparing and cooking wild fowl was published to critical acclaim, with one veteran chef describing it as the “bible” of its subject.
But Swiss police believe Violier shot himself with his hunting rifle at the weekend. His death has stunned those who knew him, with France’s leading lights of gastronomy lining up to pay tribute.
Marc Veyrat, a celebrated three-star chef, said he was “destroyed” by news of Violier’s death. “The planet has been left orphaned by this exceptional chef,” Veyrat wrote on Twitter.
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Le Matin, Veyrat added: “I met him several times and he seemed happy, strong. He had everything going for him. He’d just done a magnificent book on hunting, he was doing so many things. Perhaps he couldn’t ease up, but I can’t say why, who knows why?”
Veyrat added: “Cooking is a high-pressured job. People don’t realise how much. It’s one of the few jobs where one is judged and marked all the time. What other profession would accept being constantly evaluated?”
Pierre Gagnaire, another three-star Michelin chef, who was named by his peers as the “biggest star chef in the world” and who has restaurants in Paris, London, Tokyo, Dubai, Moscow and Berlin as well as Sketch in London, added: “Terribly sad news for an extremely talented chef.”
Paul Bocuse, named “chef of the century” by the food guide Gault et Millau and the Culinary Institute of America, said of Violier: “A grand chef, a grand man, a gigantic talent.”
Frédy Girardet, a friend of Violier and his wife Brigitte, and another three-star titan of Swiss haute cuisine who had previously run the restaurant in Crissier, said he was “completely stunned”.
He told the Tribune de Genève: “I can see no motive for such an act. He was a brilliant young man, with enormous talent and an impressive work potential. He gave the impression of being perfect. This news is so sad.”

If it is confirmed that Violier killed himself, he will not be the first to have cracked under the demands of maintaining the gastronomic excellence demanded by powerful restaurant guides such as Michelin and Gault et Millau, customers and the food critics.
A Michelin star or three – the maximum that can be awarded – or a 20/20 from the Gault et Millau can bring international glory, but the pressure to maintain the rating can be intense.
In 2003, the food world was shocked by the suicide of Bernard Loiseau, 52, a three-star chef who was reportedly distraught about criticism of his restaurant, La Côte d’Or, in Burgundy, France, and rumours that he would lose his third star.
Violier’s death came hours before the French gastronomic bible, the Michelin Red Guide, the oldest European hotel and restaurant guide whose star rating can make or break a restaurant, unveiled its 2016 French edition. Violier had retained his three stars when the latest Swiss edition of the guide was announced in November.
Before the ceremony started on Monday, those gathered stood for a minute’s silence in honour of Violier, but there were echoes of the earlier tragedy when it was revealed that Loiseau’s restaurant, run by his wife Dominique since his death 13 years ago, had lost one of its three stars.
Veyrat, who sold one of his establishments, the three-star Auberge de l’Eridan in Annecy, “for health reasons” and whose restaurant, La Maison du Bois in the French Alps, burned down last March, said he did not blame influential guides such as Michelin for the pressure, suggesting much of it was self-imposed.

“We are happy to have three stars. I gave up the evaluations and gave back my stars when I opened my last restaurant, but when it reopens I want to go chasing stars again. Because without the evaluations, the guide books, we feel orphaned. We complain about being marked, then we complain when we are not. We chefs are passionate madmen, mad with happiness.”
Violier, the son of a wine grower from the Charente-Maritime departement in south-west France, joined the kitchen team at the Crissier restaurant in 1996. A year later, the chef Philippe Rochat took over the restaurant and in 1998 was awarded three Michelin stars.
Rochat retired in 2012. Violier and his wife then took over running the restaurant. The two men were close; Violier regarded Rochat as his mentor and a second father. He was doubly devastated when his father died in April last year, and Rochat, 61, died three months later after falling ill while out cycling.
“It’s like a curse,” Veyrat said of the Crissier. “Can it survive this new drama? I think so. There are some super chefs in Benoît Violier’s establishment. He knew how to create a strong human environment, which will continue to live … I remember having youngsters who’d worked for him come to me. They were all so happy to be there, so enthusiastic to work for a great chef.”
In an interview in December 2014 with the Swiss television channel RTS, a smiling Violier said the stress of haute cuisine was “necessary” to maintain standards.
“It’s my life,” he said. “I go to sleep with cooking, I wake up to cooking.”"

The Spanish telecoms group Telefónica has come up with a novel way of reducing its wage bill by offering employees aged over 53 the chance to stay at home on 68% of their salary.
Under a new deal negotiated with trade unions, any employee over 53 with 15 years of service will continue to receive slightly more than two thirds of their salary if they do not come in to work. They will remain under contract and the company will continue to pay their social security and private health contributions until they reach 65, thus saving the state the burden of further unemployment benefits.
Under the voluntary scheme, anyone who joins it is free to return to full-time work.
Telefónica has about 28,000 employees in Spain – 21,000 in the landline business, 6,000 in mobiles and 1,000 in Soluciones, its infrastructure unit. The company estimates that 7,000 people are eligible for the scheme, which runs until the end of next year.
From next year, the scheme is expected to save €370m (£281m) a year, the company says, adding that the measure is part of the plan to “transform and simplify” the business.
BT in talks with Telefónica to buy O2 Read more
The plan was agreed within a broader agreement on pay and conditions that Telefónica reached with the union last July. The company has set a target of reducing debt to just under €32bn after reporting borrowings of nearly €50bn last year . Some of this will come from the sale of its British mobile business, 02. There is also talk of an initial public offering of the Soluciones unit.
Telefónica is Spain’s equivalent of BT, a former state-owned monopoly telecoms supplier, but liberalisation of the sector has transformed its fortunes. It has been slow to respond to competition and, for several years, has been haemorrhaging mobile clients to its two main competitors, Orange and Vodafone, as well as Yoigo.
However, Telefónica still retains the lion’s share of the Spanish mobile market which, with more than 50 million subscribers, is one of Europe’s largest. It also controls 91% of the valuable fibre-optic broadband market.
Over the past year, the battleground has shifted to football on TV, with the three main operators – Telefónica, Vodafone and Orange – vying for customers with offers of packages of national and international matches. Last autumn, Telefónica offered subscribers a package that included all Spanish league and cup matches."

On Sunday afternoon, Swiss police were called to the home Violier shared with his wife, Brigitte, where they found the chef’s body. “He appears to have taken his own life with a firearm,” the Lausanne police said in a statement.
The verdict is not yet confirmed and even if it is we may never know exactly why the French-born chef, ranked Switzerland’s number one by the prestigious Gault et Millau guide in 2013, decided to shoot himself.
'World's best chef' Benoît Violier found dead Read more
Violier had suffered two recent bereavements: his father, in April last year, and the man he called his mentor, the great Swiss chef Philippe Rochat – Violier’s predecessor at the Hotel de Ville, which has held three Michelin stars for two decades – a few months later.
But he is not the first top chef to take his own life, and his death will once more focus attention on the extraordinary, sometimes unbearable pressures they must face.
In February 2003, Bernard Loiseau, then one of the most renowned chefs in France at his flagship three-star Cote d’Or restaurant in Saulieu, Burgundy, shot himself with his hunting rifle at the age of 52.
Loiseau was depressed, overworked and heavily in debt. The Gault et Millau guide, whose opinion is considered second only to the Michelin in the world of haute cuisine, had just downgraded his establishment from 19/20 to 17, and there were strong rumours that Michelin would follow suit.
He had made it clear how high he felt the stakes were. Jacques Lameloise, the chef and owner of another three-star establishment, said Loiseau had told him bluntly: “If I lose a star, I’ll kill myself.”

In the event, Loiseau took his life soon after learning that his three stars were safe for another year. Violier, too, had retained his rating for the this year at least: the 2016 Swiss version of the Red Guide was published before the French edition, which was released in Paris on Monday. (It demoted Loiseau’s restaurant, run since his death by his wife, to two stars.)
But the constant, nagging fear of the fall from grace that might one day come, and resentment at the tyranny of a system that, many chefs feel, toys with hard-won reputations for reasons that all too often seem unclear or even arbitrary, can have a terrible psychological effect.
We’re on a razor’s edge the whole time, because what we do is a combination of art and business Three-star chef Pierre Gagnaire
“They tell you you’re one of the very best then, overnight, they tell you you’re not,” said Guy Martin, of the three-star Grand Vefour in Paris, following Loiseau’s suicide. “Why? What have you done? How can the skills you’ve painstakingly developed, the creativity you’ve nurtured, the time and energy you’ve invested, disappear from one day to the next?”
Such pressures are not new: chef Alain Zick shot himself in the head in 1966 when he learned he had lost one of his three Michelin stars. Gerard Besson had a heart attack – which he survived – in 2003 on hearing he had suffered the same fate.
As far back as 1671, the celebrated cuisinier Francois Vatel ran himself through with his sword after a delivery of fish failed to arrive on time for the banquet he was preparing for Louis XIV and 2,000 guests at the Chateau de Chantilly.
But there is evidence that today’s chefs – who must often be top-flight, profit-making businessmen as well as culinary artists – are under particular strain. “What people don’t often see,” the three-star chef Pierre Gagnaire, whose first Michelin-starred restaurant went bankrupt, said some years ago, “is that behind the facade of this profession [there] is suffering and downright exhaustion. We’re on a razor’s edge the whole time, because what we do is a combination of art and business.”
One Michelin star more (or less) is thought, in France, to be worth up to 25% of a restaurant’s turnover. But the strictures of the guide – sometimes seen as rewarding the frills more than the food, forcing restaurants to invest astronomical sums on decor, tableware and staff – impose their own pressures.

In 2005, Alain Senderens of the Lucas Carton in Paris, who had held three stars for 28 consecutive years, gave them up, saying he was fed up with the “indecent” prices – “€300 or €400 in winter, when there are truffles” – he had to charge, the “senseless race” of the ratings, and the “fussy, over-complicated food” he had to produce to satisfy the guides’ inspectors.
Senderens was not the first; Joel Robuchon handed back his stars in 1996. Nor was he the last: the Alsace super-chef Antoine Westermann followed suit in 2006, as did Marc Veyrat and Olivier Roellinger in 2009, both saying the pressure of running a three-star establishment was making them ill.
In 2011, the Australian chef Skye Gyngell found just one Michelin star “a curse” at the Petersham Nurseries in Richmond, west London. She said the award led customers to expect a fine dining experience that her restaurant, while serving great food, could not provide, and removed the star from her website.
Three Michelin stars, as Benoît Violier – whose restaurant was ranked the best of the 1,000 top eateries in the world by France’s La Liste – may have reminded us, can bring another level of expectation and pressure altogether.

Art historians have revealed that a forgotten painting stored for decades at a US museum is a work by the Dutch master Hieronymus Bosch.
The surprise discovery comes as ’s-Hertogenbosch, the hometown of the artist whose nightmarish visions earned him the moniker “the devil’s painter”, marks the 500th anniversary of his death.
The painting lay in storage for years at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri, which acquired it in the 1930s.
Entitled The Temptation of St Anthony, it shows the saint gathering water in a jug as he leans on a staff in what was probably part of a larger panel, possibly a triptych.
Initially it had been believed to be the work of one of the many students who flocked to Bosch’s workshop in ’s-Hertogenbosch.
But an international team who carried out a five-year research project using sophisticated infrared technology determined that the painting was in fact by the master himself.

The canvas, which is likely to have been painted between 1500 to 1510, “is a significant addition to the small body of existent work produced by Hieronymus Bosch”, the researchers said in a statement.
“Although the image was heavily retouched and overpainted during a 20th-century restoration, Bosch’s hand is still clearly recognisable in the original brushwork,” they said.
The painting was unveiled on Monday at the Noordbrabants Museum in Bosch’s hometown, which has succeeded in bringing together more than 20 of his 25 or so surviving works for an unprecedented retrospective, which opens on 13 February.
“The little monsters in the panel are typically Boschian,” the researchers said, highlighting a monster with a fox’s head, and a toad clambering out of the water.
Even the floating sausage that features in the painting can be found in other works by Bosch.

It is the second work that the Bosch Research and Conservation Project (BRCP) has recently determined was by the Dutch master. Late last year, the team also revealed that a drawing called The Infernal Landscape was drawn by him.
The exhibition marks the culmination of a nine-year quest by the museum director Charles de Mooij to reunite Bosch’s unique artistic legacy in the place where he worked, lived and died.
It kicks off a year of events in the medieval town in the southern Netherlands to honour its most famous son, who was born Jheronimus van Aken in about 1450.

The newly discovered work will join 20 paintings and 18 other drawings among about 100 works on display in the exhibition Hieronymus Bosch - Visions of Genius, which runs until 8 May.
But Bosch’s most famous work, The Garden of Earthly Delights, which journeys from Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to a terrifying vision of hell, will not be on display.
The triptych hangs in the Prado Museum in Madrid, and has never travelled abroad. But in a remarkable coup, the Prado has agreed to allow Bosch’s The Haywain to leave Spain for the first time in 450 years."

Authorities in Cologne have vowed to do everything in their power to make sure the city’s famous carnival is not blighted by a repeat of the violence seen on New Year’s Eve.
The city’s new police chief, Jürgen Mathies, said on Monday that more than 2,000 officers would work 12-hour shifts alongside 350 cadets to guarantee safety on the streets during the “women’s carnival day” (Weiberfastnacht) on Thursday, twice as many officers as were employed in 2015.
Video surveillance would also be increased, said Mathies, whose predecessor resigned after the scale of the New Year’s Eve assaults became apparent in early January.
More than 1,000 people have since filed criminal complaints, including about 433 women alleging sexual assault. Some of the victims have jointly filed a single complaint, so that the number of alleged crimes stands at more than 750, of which more than 380 are sexual offences, including at least three rapes.
Cologne police are investigating 43 suspects in connection with the incidents, the majority of whom are Moroccan or Algerian. Nine of the suspects are currently in prison.

The organisers of the Cologne carnival have published a leaflet for refugees that explains the customs of the tradition, warning non-Germans not to worry if they meet locals wearing historic soldier uniforms. “Their guns are only made of wood, and are only loaded with flowers – every single one a small expression of colourful, peaceful coexistence,” it reads.
Marking the last Thursday before Lent, Cologne’s Weiberfastnacht traditionally sees women dressed in colourful costumes frequenting the streets and bars of the city, pecking strangers on the cheek and playing practical jokes, such as cutting off ties. The “crazy days” of carnival peak with a procession of floats on the following Monday.
Cologne’s mayor, Henriette Reker, said she had “not the slightest concern” that people would not be able to celebrate carnival as usual, while also admitting that “one can never provide a guarantee for 100% safety”.
In an interview with Die Welt newspaper, Reker also said she regretted the phrasing of her controversial suggestion that women “keep at arm’s length” from strangers to avoid harassment.
“It would have been more sensible to say in that press conference that I was talking about New Year’s Eve and nothing else,” the mayor said. The remark about keeping strangers “at arm’s length” had been a quote from a brochure for young women, Reker said.
“That’s something that every good mother would tell her daughter when she leaves the house. You can’t do schunkeln [swaying from side to side with locked arms, another Cologne carnival custom] at arm’s length either, I know that. I’m a Cologne girl, after all,” Reker said."

Negotiations to reset the terms of Britain’s EU membership are reaching their final stages after Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, announced he would table proposals on Tuesday for a “new settlement” for the UK.
The former prime minister of Poland said he had made good progress with British and other officials since meeting David Cameron in Downing Street on Sunday night.
Tusk tweeted: “Tomorrow around noon I will table proposal for a new settlement for #UKinEU. Good progress last 24 hours but still outstanding issues.”
Cameron is expected to brief the cabinet on Tuesday morning on the state of his negotiations with Tusk, who hopes to reach a deal at the next European council meeting on 18-19 February.
A failure to reach agreement could lead Tusk to convene a second, extra, summit by the first week of March to allow Cameron to hold an in/out referendum on Britain’s EU membership on his preferred date of 23 June.
Downing Street is likely to give a detailed response to Tusk’s statement on Tuesday, which is likely to be highly detailed and will explain any legislative changes that are needed. Cameron will speak out if he believes that Tusk has failed to meet his demands in the most contentious areas of welfare reforms and protections for non-eurozone members.
Cameron will then embark on a tour of EU capitals over the next two weeks to persuade EU leaders to back his demands or risk forcing the UK out of the EU.
Downing Street said earlier that good progress had been made in the negotiations. The prime minister was encouraged when Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, agreed at a meeting in Brussels on Friday that an emergency brake to limit benefit payments to EU migrants could be imposed as soon as a referendum is passed.
It is understood that a mechanism proposed by Juncker, which would be set out in the Tusk letter, says current levels of migration to the UK would justify the application of the brake.
But Downing Street says the emergency brake would have to be as effective as the prime minister’s original proposal of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits.
Steve Baker, the Tory MP for Wycombe, who is a leading member of the Vote Leave group, has described the brake as a “joke” amid claims that it would be lifted after four years. The prime minister is understood to be pressing for restrictions on benefits to be applied for seven years.
No 10 indicated that more work was needed on Osborne’s demands for non-eurozone countries to be given protections from rules drawn up for the single market.
Downing Street said the UK was looking for a watertight “enforcement mechanism”, though not a veto, to allow non-eurozone members to flag up concerns. This could involve contentious legislation being referred to EU leaders on the European council. France is nervous because no member state has a veto over the rules of the single market, while each EU leader has a veto on the European council.
More work was also needed to stop non-EU citizens getting access to Britain through “sham marriages”. Non-EU citizens who marry a UK citizen have no automatic right to settle in the UK. But if they marry a citizen of another EU country they can move to the UK under the EU’s rules on free movement.
Welcoming progress in the talks over the weekend, No 10 denied that Cameron was staging a confrontation with EU leaders before delivering a deal at a summit later this month.
“I wouldn’t accept that at all,” the prime minister’s spokeswoman said in response to criticisms from the Vote Leave and Leave.EU campaign groups. “Look at the amount of hard work, time and effort that the prime minister, other senior ministers and indeed senior government officials have put into this and into making progress. Look at the work we have had to do with a number of other European countries that have raised concerns. These are significant, far-reaching reforms. That is why it is taking time.”"

Meanwhile, its £18,600 minimum income rule is casting families into misery and destitution and potential loss of life. At a time when David Cameron has pronounced on his determination to strengthen and support UK families, the Home Office is destroying families. Given that, like so many others who have achieved asylum and citizenship, Mr Aziz and Mr Sharif had to subsist in the UK on poverty wages and insecure employment which would never have allowed them to achieve visas for their wives and children, their situations are beyond repair. So do these families fall under the label of “a bunch of migrants”?
Expatriate US Google employees based in the UK almost certainly have no problem bringing with them spouses and children. The second part of article 8 on family life includes a number of caveats, including denial of visa if entry is deemed a threat to “the economic wellbeing of the country”. Google’s tax arrangements are just that, but there won’t be any Google deportations happening any time soon. Many more than double standards here?

• The ruling by Judge Mark Ockelton and Mr Justice Bernard McCloskey enabling four Syrian refugees – three of whom are children – to join their family in Britain is to be welcomed (Allowing four Syrian refugees into UK ‘may set limited precedent’, theguardian.com, 29 January).
In all decisions relating to the placement of children, whether in the UK or elsewhere, their fundamental right to family life and the protection of their best interests must be the primary considerations. That immigration and border controls should keep children who are already in such desperate circumstances separated from their families is both legally and morally indefensible.

In order for children to be safely reunited with their families it is imperative that sufficient resources are made available to those agencies and statutory bodies responsible for child protection. This includes ensuring that UK local authority children’s services departments have the capacity to deal with the often complex issues involved in assessing the needs of children and the capability of their families to care for them. They must also be equipped to manage international cases, cooperating with overseas agencies to ensure that every child has the opportunity of a safe placement with their family, regardless of where they are from.

• I do hope that the government will heed the calls from many quarters to do more to help the thousands of unaccompanied children already in Europe (Charity welcomes ‘significant’ move by UK on child refugees, 29 January).But they also need to do better to ensure that, when asylum seekers arrive in this country, they are distributed more equably. At present statistics show that the 10 areas with the highest ratio of asylum seekers per 1,000 population are all in northern England, Wales or Scotland. Most of these are also places with relatively high levels of deprivation and unemployment. Middlesborough, for example, recently castigated for its “red doors”, easily tops the list, while the prosperous south is conspicuous by its absence. This cannot be right – all parts of the country should share the burden in a fair and equable manner.

The EU and US have missed a deadline to fix new rules to protect Europeans’ personal data from US government snooping, with officials from the European commission and US Department of Commerce remaining locked in talks after a self-imposed January deadline came and went.
“There have been constructive but difficult talks over the weekend,” a commission spokesperson said on Monday. “Work is still ongoing, we are not there yet, but the commission is working day and night on achieving a deal.”
The two sides have been racing to rewrite rules on sharing European citizens’ data across the Atlantic, after the European court of justice ruled last October that the EU-US “safe harbour” rules were invalid.
What is 'safe harbour' and why did the EUCJ just declare it invalid? Read more
The safe harbour agreement was drawn up in 2000 to facilitate the seamless transfer of data across the Atlantic, but vanished overnight with the court decision after a wider outcry in Europe about the revelations of US whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The case was triggered when an Austrian law student and privacy campaigner, Max Schrems, launched a complaint against Facebook in 2013, shortly before Snowden revealed that the US National Security Agency was routinely intercepting data from emails, social media and telephones.
Schrems had initially wanted to find out what had happened to his personal records, but Snowden’s revelations encouraged him to take action against the data regulator in Ireland, where Facebook has its European headquarters.
EU privacy law forbids the movement of citizens’ data outside the bloc unless it is transferred to a location deemed to have protections in line with European standards.
Although an agreement could be reached in the next few days, the two sides remain at odds over how to monitor a new data-sharing agreement and get redress for EU citizens, an EU source said.
Whether or not an agreement is reached between the EU and US, regulators from Europe’s 28 national data protection agencies will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to work out the next steps. Their decision will affect 4,000 companies including Facebook, Google and Microsoft, as well as many smaller companies which were using the safe harbour agreement to transfer employee or customer data across the Atlantic.
'Safe harbour' ruling illustrates growing chasm between US and EU Read more
Following the ECJ decision last October, companies have been looking into alternatives to safe harbour, such as writing data-sharing clauses into terms and conditions. But it is unclear whether these will satisfy European regulators who will determine whether they are in line with the ECJ judgement.
Henriette Tielemans, a partner at the law firm Covington & Burling, said companies faced “enormous uncertainty” about what European regulators would deem adequate privacy protection.
“If there is no agreement on safe harbour 2.0 that doesn’t mean there are no alternatives,” she said. “There are very valid alternatives. The real question for me is: are these alternatives going to be changed or abolished?”"
Refugees|Opinion|Migration|Greece|Europe|Turkey|Syria|comment,2016-02-01T18:45:22,guardian,Paul Mason,"With a million new refugees expected in Europe this year, Greece faces a diplomatic onslaught and an existential crisis",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/europes-refugee-story-has-hardly-begun-greece,Europe’s refugee story has hardly begun,en,opinion,,"The refugee story has hardly begun. There will be, on conservative estimates, another million arriving via Turkey this year – and maybe more. The distribution quotas proposed by Germany, and resisted by many states in eastern Europe, are already a fiction and will fade into insignificance as the next wave comes.
Germany itself will face critical choices: if you’re suddenly running a budget deficit to meet the needs of asylum seekers, how do you justify not spending on the infrastructure that’s supposed to serve German citizens, which has crumbled through underinvestment in the Angela Merkel era?
But these problems are sideshows compared with the big, existential issues that a second summer of uncontrolled migration into Greece would bring.
First, there’s the diplomatic onslaught on Greece. Last week the European Commission mulled quarantining Greece by building a razor-wire fence inside the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which is not even a member of the EU. German sources floated the idea of cancelling Greece’s debt if only Greece would agree to jail 400,000 migrants. A Belgian minister, in an EU negotiation, is alleged – by his Greek counterpart – to have demanded the Greeks “push back or sink” the boats coming from Turkey, in breach of international law. Others in Europe are proposing to criminalise the NGOs that are helping the refugees as they arrive in the islands.
If any of these things happen, they are likely to tear Greek civil society apart. Long before that, these demands are demonstrating to the rest of Europe the incapacity of its leading powers and institutions to face facts: the next million refugees could only be stopped by a policy of pushback that would break all humanitarian law.
Problem number two is the moral implosion of the Turkish government. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s army has already turned the Kurdish regions of southern Turkey into a war zone. Now he is pushing for life imprisonment for two prominent journalists from the secularist newspaper Cumhuriyet, for an investigation that claimed to show proof that his government was sending arms to IS. This is not some maverick judge at work – the demand for a 30-year sentence was brought by Erdoğan himself: head of state of a country that still thinks it could join Europe and that retains its Nato membership, with no discouragement so far from Brussels.
The third problem is the paralysis of the EU institutions. Germany unilaterally suspended the Dublin treaty, which would have forced migrants to return to Greece to be processed. Most eastern-European countries have rejected Germany’s proposed redistribution mechanism, preferring a system regulated by jagged pieces of metal and police wearing surgical masks. Schengen is close to being a dead letter.
Unlike the Greek debt crisis – where “extend and pretend” has been the watchword – this indecision, illusion and failure to confront facts is urgent.
Greece is not going to “push back or sink” inflatables containing refugees. However many compromises Alexis Tsipras’s government made over austerity, it is full of human rights lawyers, criminology professors and people who spent their lives fighting fascism. There is outrage at Europe’s demands inside the Greek political establishment, ranging well beyond the radical-left party Syriza and its small nationalist coalition partner.
Eastern Europe is, by and large, going to let the refugees go to hell. There is very little compassion in the media coverage of the refugees east of the former Iron Curtain. Poland, Hungary and Slovakia have swung towards populist nationalism. While there are tens of millions of liberal-minded, largely young people who are prepared to show compassion and adhere to international obligations, they do not control east Europe’s governments.
As for Turkey, it has, to date, taken no visibly stronger measures to keep Syrian refugees inside its own borders and prevent the deadly traffic across the sea to Greece. For a state that can arrest its own newspaper editors at will and bomb its own cities, that demonstrates a clear set of priorities.
So there are only two variables: what the EU does next and what the European peoples do.
If Germany has given up trying to organise the orderly distribution of refugees inside the EU, then free movement itself is on borrowed time. Everybody understands this, except the political and media classes who have to maintain the fiction that everything is fine. Germany had, by December, registered just over half the 900,000 asylum claims it is facing. The hard-right AfD party has sprung from sixth to third in the polls. Angela Merkel seems frozen in the headlights of the oncoming train.
Which leaves the people. Quietly, and without rhetoric, one of the most spectacular, cross-border solidarity movements ever formed has emerged to help the refugees. Churches, NGOs, communities, police forces and social services – plus ordinary people with no big agenda – just got on and saved people, moved them along, gave them water, food and clothing, and are right now helping them to settle in.
Against that, of course, there are people such as the young British men who gave the fascist salute, unmasked, to the TV cameras, during the fracas at Dover this weekend.
Our grandfathers smashed fascism – outlawed it, executed its leaders, suppressed its ideas – because they knew how seductive that stiff-armed salute can be to idiots with a grievance, once all the illusions start to burn. They squeezed Germany dry of geopolitical power because they knew it had a tendency to be wielded unwisely, even by democrats. They thanked their lucky stars that eastern Europe was somebody else’s problem. And they deployed an army to ensure Greece stayed pro-western and democratic.
In this, the generation of Churchill and Attlee showed greater strategic vision than the current one. David Cameron’s obsession with negotiating a fig-leaf concession on migrant in-work benefits from Europe seems, when set against the scale of the historic challenge, small. Jeremy Corbyn’s trip to Calais did not even ask the roaring questions: what should Germany do; what should the Commission do; what should the UK Border Force do? By reverting to gestures, British politicians are already signalling strategic disengagement with Europe’s migration crisis, which itself is feeding in to the negative popular perception of the EU.
There is a rising concern in British political circles that the next million refugees might tip the UK electorate into voting for Brexit. I suspect that’s too simple. The biggest threat to British consent for EU membership would be if the European Commission tries to force Greece to drown migrants, and then turns it into a quarantined prison camp when it refuses. People would rightly ask in whose name that was being done."

As the use of drones increasingly worries everyone from firefighters and air traffic control to law enforcement, Netherlands’ national police have aligned themselves with a group that hates flying robots on principle: the bald eagle.
Dutch police have joined forces with Guard From Above, a raptor-training security firm based in the Hague, to keep wayward drones from causing trouble by snatching them out of the sky.
Guard From Above’s chief executive officer Sjoerd Hoogendoorn described the project in a press release as “a low-tech solution for a high-tech problem”. He and the company’s chief operating officer, Ben de Keijzer, train birds of prey to catch unauthorised unmanned vehicles – Hoogendoorn’s background is in private security, de Keijzer’s is in bird-handling and training.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Two Guard From Above raptors in action
Birds, said the National Audubon Society’s Geoff LeBaron, are generally dubious about drones anyway as they tend to demonstrate terrible avian manners.
Often drones lose their flying privileges because local birds feel crowded. “The drones are pretty much the size of a bird of prey, so smaller birds on the ground aren’t likely to mob a bird of prey when it’s flying – but larger birds are, especially when it’s around their nests,” said LeBaron, who’d seen the behavior in barnacle geese as well as raptors like ospreys. “The birds of prey are having an aggressive interaction to defend their territory from another bird of prey.”
LeBaron is the director of the organization’s Christmas Bird Count, a crowdsourced wildlife census that tracks US bird populations. The birds, he said, are in many cases demonstrating that they have superior onboard equipment to the drones.
Close encounters of the drone kind: near-collisions with UAVs increasing Read more
“What I find fascinating is that birds can hit the drone in such a way that they don’t get injured by the rotors,” said LeBaron. “They seem to be whacking the drone right in the centre so they don’t get hit; they have incredible visual acuity and they can probably actually see the rotors.”
Humans, of course, only see rotors as a blur – LeBaron suspects that the eagles can make out the complete movement and thus have no trouble avoiding injury. It doesn’t hurt, either, that attacking a drone the way a bird might attack another bird is usually effective. “Their method of attack is always going to be to hit it in the middle of the back; with the drones they perceive the rotors on the side and so they just go for the rear.”
The birds Guard From Above is using – in the video above, a pair of bald eagles, one immature and one adult – appear trained not merely to disable the drone, but to retrieve it, an even trickier feat.
Using birds to take down drones is that latest in a series of attempts to tackle unwanted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In Japan, drones using nets have been developed to capture rogue UAV that might threaten disruptions along flight paths.

Dozens of contracts running into billions of dollars were discussed. He met the pope, the Italian prime minister, the French president, and many business leaders.
The security services continue to harass and detain activists, writers and journalists
After years of tensions and mistrust, the scenes of a smiling Iranian leader being welcomed with open arms in European capitals were in stark contrast with the recent past. Yet in spite of the feelgood imagery, to believe that Iran’s regime has altogether transformed itself and might now be moving towards decisive domestic reform and a constructive role on the international stage would be naive and shortsighted.
Iran may have a president with a “moderate” profile – one whose smooth approach comes as a relief after the Ahmadinejad years – but that does not mean the authoritarian nature of the regime or the objectives of its foreign policy have changed. Iran still ranks as one of the most repressive states in the world, and there has been no improvement.

The government was probably looking for a public relations bonus in the west when it recently released a number of journalists, but the statistics tell another story: in 2015 Iran executed at least 830 people, including juveniles, many for non-violent crimes. The security services continue to harass and detain activists, writers and journalists. The methods used by the regime to crush the pro-democracy Green movement in 2009 are still very much in use today.
Nor has Iran become in any way more “moderate” in its behaviour in the Middle East. In Syria, Iran’s militias and Republican Guards are direct participants in the war crimes that the Assad regime inflicts on its own population. Iran’s close ally Hezbollah played a key role in the siege of Madaya, where children died of hunger as a result, and it is part of similar operations elsewhere.

It is to be hoped that a sustained implementation of the nuclear agreement will improve international security. But to draw from that the notion that Iran must now be spared any reproach would be foolish. Iran’s hardliners sought economic relief through the nuclear deal because they desperately want to keep their hold on power, not because they want to pursue a more democratic path at home or more rational policies abroad. Diplomacy is important, but it must not come at the expense of clearsightedness, nor should it be accompanied by the kind of simplistic analysis that puts the sole onus on Saudi Arabia rather than on Iran as far as human rights are concerned. The records of both countries are equally dismal.
In the reporting of President Rouhani’s visit, the covering up of nude statues in Rome, supposedly to spare the Iranian delegation a sight they would find objectionable, was treated as a sort of comic interlude. But it is hardly a laughing matter that, while its president was on a charm offensive in Europe, Iran’s military forces were carrying on their brutal operations in Syria as usual. It is Iran’s responsibility for the crimes that have generated the refugee crisis that is the true obscenity, not a few nude statues in the Capitoline museum."
Telecommunications industry|Nils Pratley on finance|Ofcom|Regulators|Mobile phones|Consumer affairs|Sharon White|comment,2016-02-01T19:42:37,guardian,Nils Pratley,"Brussels legislation means UK regulator’s views are virtually redundant on the tie-up, a move that could result in much higher bills for consumers",https://www.theguardian.com/media/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/feb/01/ofcom-chief-writing-ft-three-o2-merger,Ofcom chief reduced to writing in FT to air views on Three-O2 merger,en,business,,"It is a poor show that Sharon White, head of the communications regulator Ofcom, is reduced to writing columns in the FT to try to block Three’s takeover of O2. The blame lies with European legislation, which dictates that Brussels decides on deals between companies whose parents have big operations in more than one EU country, as both Three and O2 do.
Still, at least White is doing her best to crank up the pressure on the EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager. White signalled her opposition to the £10bn deal in a speech last October and now she has slammed her cards on the table. She is right to do so: a combination of Three and O2, creating a new market leader and reducing the number of UK networks from four to three, would damage competition and leave consumers poorer.
Ah, the network operators always plead in these circumstances, the investment demands in the telecoms industry are so heavy that they can only be undertaken by big companies that can write large cheques.
White examined this argument and found no supporting evidence. Mobile companies have maintained healthy cashflow margins above 12% in the UK even while rolling out 4G technology. “Competition, not consolidation, has driven investment,” as she puts it.
What’s more, fewer competitors usually means higher prices for customers. In Austria, which underwent a similar four-to-three consolidation, mobile prices have risen 15%, with light users – often the young and the old – suffering steeper increases. The Austrian experiment is one the UK would happily live without, especially as Three, with its all-you-can-eat data packages, has demonstrably added to biodiversity in the UK telecoms jungle.
Vestager, thankfully, may be sympathetic to White’s views. She threw so many obstacles in front of a four-to-three consolidation in her homeland of Denmark that the proposed deal collapsed.
But there are still reasons to worry. First, Denmark may be the exception: four-to-three consolidation has also been allowed in Germany and Ireland. Second, Ofcom is concerned that the European telecoms framework leaves national regulators under-equipped to deal with emerging oligopolies. White, in that same speech last October, joined European counterparts in pleading for “the full range of tools to do the job” – a cry as yet unanswered.
If Three/02 is allowed to happen it would be a slap in the face for Ofcom and a severe blow to the credibility of UK telecoms regulation. No wonder White is deploying unorthodox tactics instead of relying on backroom chats in Brussels. The sooner Vestager says no to Three/02 the better.
Breaking up might be hard to do at BT
BT has no such worries on the mobile front. Its purchase of EE was completed last week and, by way of celebration, BT’s shares closed within pennies of 500p on Monday, boosted also by a strong set of third-quarter numbers. It would have been the highest price for the shares since those gung-ho dotcom days of 2001, just before BT’s last adventure in mobile ended with the sale of Cellnet to reduce debt.
In the circumstances, BT can’t be surprised that it is regarded in some quarters as recreating a hideous monopoly. Break it up, comes the cry, and Grant Shapps, former Tory party chairman, has persuaded 120 MPs to support forced separation of Openreach, the bit of BT that owns and manages the copper-and-fibre networks.
Liberating Openreach is one decision Ofcom can make (it will opine later this month) but the Shapps lobby should be careful what it wishes for. An independent Openreach would still be a dominant supplier of wholesale broadband connections and its economic incentives to invest in better infrastructure would not increase one jot on day one. Indeed, an independent Openreach, which would presumably be burdened with a proportionate share of BT’s pension liabilities, might try to milk profits over time.
Best to leave Openreach within BT and do two things. Hit it with fines that properly hurt if service standards don’t improve. And find ways to promote real competition. Sky and TalkTalk are conducting trials of an ultrafast broadband network in York. Regulatory encouragement for such ventures seems a smarter way to proceed than taking a sledgehammer to BT."

French authorities have demolished a makeshift church and mosque as part of a security operation at the Jungle camp in Calais.
Monday’s operation was the culmination of a two-week effort to clear a 100-metre security zone around the perimeter of the camp, a regional official said.
The official said refugees and charity groups helping them had been informed of the pending demolition on 19 January, and no one was hurt in the operation.
However, the pastor of the church said authorities had told him the church was safe from destruction. The Rev Teferi Shuremo clashed with police holding riot shields as excavation machines crushed the structure.
“They are trying to destroy peace,” he told reporters, clinging to a huge wooden cross salvaged from the church.
About 4,000 people from Syria, Sudan and other countries are estimated to be camped out in Calais as they try to reach Britain. Some recently moved into new facilities but most are still sleeping in what’s been called Europe’s biggest slum.
The French government has faced criticism for failing to provide basic care for the refugees and migrants, who have built their own shelters, schools, stores and places of worship.
The regional official said the mosque had already been abandoned and no one had protested against its destruction. He said refugees were free to construct new places of worship.
Shuremo pledged to build another church. Asked where, he said, “I don’t know. God will give me help.”
Before the mechanical shovels started their work, churchgoers held one last prayer hand in hand and worked with volunteer activists to clear the site.
Joshua Williams, a British volunteer, said activists have worked to protect some shelters from demolition and to salvage wiring and other useful material."

Russia’s New Times magazine has been hit with a state fine and a hacker attack on the day it published an investigation of president Vladimir Putin’s daughter.
The state communications oversight agency on Monday issued a warning and a fine to the magazine, which was founded in 1943 and has been critical of the Kremlin in recent years, for an article in the January issue that mentioned the Ukrainian ultranationalist group Right Sector without noting that it is banned in Russia, RBC newspaper reported. A publication can be shut down if it receives two warnings in 12 months.
But the penalty against New Times came the same day it published new information about Putin’s older daughter, Maria. After the magazine’s website also went down for several hours on Monday, editor Yevgeniya Albats told RBC she believed a distributed denial-of-service attack was the cause.
The Kremlin has long been suspected of wielding cyber-attacks against political opponents and critical websites. Albats said New Times last suffered such an attack after an interview with Putin foe Mikhail Khodorkovsky in 2013.

Discussing Putin’s private life has long been taboo in Russia, but publications have recently begun to draw back the veil of secrecy, finding that his two daughters and their associates have enjoyed speedy success in politics and business along with other children of the Kremlin elite.
Moscow State University official Katerina Tikhonova, 29, was outed as the president’s younger daughter last year and found to have corporate holdings worth more than £1.3bn with her partner Kirill Shamalov.
Using property and academic records and testimony from building employees, New Times found that Putin’s older daughter Maria, 30, lives in a well-guarded flat block near the American embassy in Moscow and is a graduate student at an endocrine centre run by the health ministry.
Her academic advisor Ivan Dedov received a state honour from Putin in orders published on Monday, and his son was recently appointed a judge from Russia at the European court of human rights.
Maria enjoys travel and as a student toured the Mediterranean in a mega-yacht with friends, New Times reported. Putin was accused of corruption last month by US officials, drawing an angry response from the Kremlin that threatened to further strain relations."

Chechnya’s Kremlin-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, posted a video on Monday of the Russian opposition leader Mikhail Kasyanov in a gunman’s crosshairs.
Kadyrov has engaged in increasingly hostile rhetoric towards the Russian opposition in recent weeks. The video was issued weeks before the first anniversary of the murder of Boris Nemtsov, another prominent opposition figure. On Monday night, the video was removed from Kadyrov’s Instagram account.
Zaur Dadayev, a high-ranking officer in Kadyrov’s security forces, has been charged with gunning down Nemtsov, Kasyanov’s co-chairman of the RPR-Parnas party, near the Kremlin in February 2015. Russia’s investigative committee said on Friday it had closed the case, although Ruslan Mukhudinov, a Chechen security officer who is charged with organising the hit, remains at large.

“Kasyanov has come to Strasbourg for money for the Russian opposition,” Kadyrov wrote as he posted the video for his 1.6 million Instagram followers.
“Whoever didn’t understand will get it,” he added, a phrase that is also the title of a forthcoming self-produced action film starring the Chechen leader, who has frequently been accused of human rights abuses.
Last week, Kasyanov, a former Russian prime minister, called on deputies at a parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg to prepare a special report on the Nemtsov murder investigation and warned that Kadyrov’s comments, labelling the opposition “enemies of the people”, marked a broader crackdown on regime critics. During the trip, he also told the exiled Crimean Tatar leader, Mustafa Dzhemilev, that Crimea would eventually be returned to Ukraine.
In a Facebook post on Monday, Kasyanov called the crosshairs video a “direct threat of a murder motivated by political hatred” and said President Vladimir Putin, who appointed Kadyrov in 2007, “bears personal responsibility for Kadyrov’s actions” and should condemn them.
Instagram deleted the crosshairs video for violating its rule that users respect one another, a spokesperson told Vedomosti newspaper.
The RPR-Parnas deputy chairman, Vladimir Kara-Murza, seen walking with Kasyanov in the video, called it an “instigation to murder”.
Kara-Murza said he was the victim of a poisoning attempt similar to that of Alexander Litvinenko after he suffered sudden illness and organ failure in May, as a result of which he now walks with a cane.

The video is the latest attack in Kadyrov’s war of words against Russia’s liberal opposition, which has been increasingly marginalised since tensions with the west began rising in 2014. In January, Kadyrov employed the Stalin-era phrase “enemies of the people” to argue that opposition activists were puppets of western intelligence and should be prosecuted for treason. Magomed Daudov, the head of Kadyrov’s administration, posted a photograph of his boss with a Caucasian sheepdog named Tarzan, declaring that its “fangs are itching” for opposition activists and journalists.
Kadyrov even held a giant rally against the opposition in Chechnya’s capital, Grozny, where Daudov listed Kasyanov as one of many “traitors”.
Putin, who awarded Kadyrov a medal days after Nemtsov’s killing, has continued to condone his actions, praising him at the end of January for “working effectively”.
In response to the “enemies of the people” remark, Konstantin Senchenko, a Krasnoyarsk city council member, called Kadyrov an “embarrassment to Russia” but later apologised after a backlash. Kadyrov posted a video of Senchenko apologising, with the caption: “I accept.”"

David Cameron has been told that he will need to launch a diplomatic offensive in eastern Europe over the next two weeks to win Poland and its allies over to his plan to restrict benefit payments to EU migrants.
The prime minister has been warned by Whitehall figures that he has to do more to convince leaders in eastern Europe, as negotiations on Britain’s future in Europe enter their final stages with the publication of proposals by the European council president Donald Tusk for a “new settlement”.
Donald Tusk to table EU reform proposals after Cameron talks Read more
Beata Maria Szydło, the Polish prime minister, told Cameron in Warsaw late last year that Poland and the other three members of the Visegrád group – Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia – are opposed to any changes that will discriminate against their citizens working in the UK.
Downing Street was encouraged when Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, agreed at a meeting in Brussels on Friday that an emergency brake to limit benefit payments to EU migrants for four years could be imposed as soon as a referendum is passed.
However, the proposal is causing concern among east European leaders, who fear a backlash among their citizens in the UK who still have the right to vote in domestic elections.
“The prime minister will be focusing quite heavily on the Visegrád group over the next two weeks,” one Whitehall source. “It is clear that there are nerves about how Poles, Czechs, Hungarians and workers from the Baltic States working in the UK might vote in elections back home.”
No 10 rejects criticism of David Cameron's EU negotiations Read more
Senior British sources said they are encouraged by the progress in the prime minister’s negotiations which intensified over the weekend with the Juncker meeting on Friday and a dinner with Tusk in No 10 on Sunday night.
Tusk tweeted on Monday night that he had made good progress with British and other officials since meeting Cameron in Downing Street on Sunday night, though he said there are still outstanding areas.
Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) Tomorrow around noon I will table proposal for a new settlement for #UKinEU. Good progress last 24 hours but still outstanding issues
Cameron is expected to brief the cabinet on Tuesday morning on the state of his negotiations with Tusk, who hopes to reach a deal at the next European council meeting on 18-19 February.
A failure to reach agreement could lead Tusk to convene a second, extra, summit by the first week of March to allow Cameron to hold an in/out referendum on Britain’s EU membership on his preferred date of 23 June.
One UK source said: “Things seem to be moving in the right direction. But there’s many a slip ‘twixt the cup and the lip.”
The prime minister will give a detailed response to Tusk’s statement on Tuesday, which is likely to be highly detailed and will explain any legislative changes that are needed. No 10 sought to highlight progress by saying that the prime minister has secured agreement on one of his demands set out in the Conservative general election manifesto – a red card system that will allow a group of national parliaments to club together to block EU legislation.
Under Tusk’s draft agreement, 55% of the EU’s national parliaments could force the European council to stop or amend legislation they believe is unnecessary. A No 10 source said: “This will strengthen the power of Westminster to stop unnecessary EU laws and addresses concerns that the current yellow card system has not proved strong enough. It ensures that the European commission cannot just ignore the will of national parliamentarians and delivers greater democratic control over what the EU does.”
Cameron’s EU deal negotiations: the key questions answered Read more
The red card system has been relatively uncontroversial in the negotiations. The more difficult areas have been the prime minister’s plan to ban EU migrants from claiming in-work benefits for four years. Downing Street says the emergency brake would have to be as effective as the prime minister’s original proposal of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits.
No 10 indicated that more work was needed on Osborne’s demands for non-eurozone countries to be given protections from rules drawn up for the single market.
Downing Street said the UK was looking for a watertight “enforcement mechanism”, though not a veto, to allow non-eurozone members to flag up concerns. This could involve contentious legislation being referred to EU leaders on the European council. France is nervous because no member state has a veto over the rules of the single market, while each EU leader has a veto on the European council.
More work was also needed to stop non-EU citizens getting access to Britain through “sham marriages”. Non-EU citizens who marry a UK citizen have no automatic right to settle in the UK. But if they marry a citizen of another EU country they can move to the UK under the EU’s rules on free movement."

Sir David Frost’s son was not told that he was at risk from a rare genetic disorder inherited from his father before his unexpected death at the age of 31 last summer.
Miles Frost, who worked as a financial investor, collapsed while running in Oxfordshire, and the family have revealed that his death was caused by the congenital heart condition hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).
David Frost died in 2013 aged 74 after suffering a heart attack on the Queen Elizabeth cruise ship, and a postmortem revealed he had the condition. Miles and his surviving brothers were not told that there was a 50% chance they had inherited it.
Sir David Frost's son Miles dies, aged 31 Read more
Wilfred and George Frost wrote in the Sunday Times that their brother’s death came “totally and utterly out of the blue”, and the knowledge that he might have been able to live a normal life with proper treatment “adds to the agony relating to Miles’s death”.
The family have now launched a fund in Miles’s memory. The endowment, launched in partnership with the British Heart Foundation, aims to raise £1.5m to ensure that genetic testing for immediate family members of those affected by HCM is available nationwide.
About one in 500 people are born with the faulty gene that causes the condition, and each child of someone with HCM has a 50% chance of inheriting it, the British Heart Foundation said. HCM causes the muscle wall of the heart to become stiff, leading to heart failure. Most people who have HCM are undiagnosed and have no symptoms.
Wilfred Frost said: “Miles’s death will always be incomprehensible to us, but the circumstances surrounding it have made losing him even more difficult to bear.
“However, we are determined to look forward and plan to use his passing to create a positive legacy by improving diagnosis for HCM. If the Miles Frost Fund helps to prevent just one similar death occurring, then Miles will not have died in vain.”

Miles’s mother, Lady Carina Frost, said: “I will never forget the joy of handing Miles over to David. David was just totally besotted with Miles the moment he was born. He quite simply was born an old soul. And everybody was drawn to his wisdom, love, loyalty and laughter. After David died I just couldn’t have survived without Miles.”
George Frost, Miles’s youngest brother, said: “The hole left by Miles’s death can never be filled. But if we can help prevent other families experiencing something similar, it will be a great relief.”
Simon Gillespie, chief executive at the British Heart Foundation, said: “I cannot praise highly enough the courage and vision of the Frost family in setting up this fund. The money raised by the Miles Frost Fund will help to establish a fully functional, UK-wide cascade testing service for parents, siblings and children who could be at risk.
“Working with the Frost family, our aim is to ensure people who have HCM are identified and treated to prevent a needless loss of life.”

I was sitting with my wife one evening when I realised I couldn’t lift my right arm. Both my arm and hand were numb. I immediately suspected a stroke. My sister-in-law had been left paralysed down her right side and unable to speak after a major stroke. We visited her most days to try to help her communicate, and I had read everything I could about strokes.
In fact, we had been discussing my sister-in-law’s situation when I realised my arm had gone numb. I ran through the Fast checks in my mind: there was no pain, no dizziness, no symptoms other than my arm. But I remembered the t in Fast – time – was the most important. I asked my wife to call 999, deciding we could argue later if I was wrong.
A first responder paramedic arrived in about five minutes from his base five miles away in Oakham [in Rutland]. He did vital signs checks and agreed with my tentative diagnosis so called an ambulance to take me straight to the stroke unit at Peterborough, some 25 miles away.
Once there I was quickly examined. As the symptoms had not worsened, I was kept in under observation. But when I got out of bed to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, my right leg would not work so I pressed the bell for help. In seconds a small army of people were there to take me first for a CT scan and then to a bay where a drip was fitted, blood samples were taken and a doctor did whatever doctors do.
The stroke unit nurse who had checked me in was with me the whole time, holding my hand and reassuring me that I was in the best possible hands. I must have been given a sedative because the next thing I remember was waking up in a private room. The nurse was still with me, and called in to see how I was at the start of every shift for my entire stay in Peterborough.
Those first few days were very confusing because although I seemed able to think clearly, I could not speak or understand what people were saying. I made sounds that I thought were speech but could not make myself understood. A speech therapist gave me some exercises to practise with a mirror so the next time my wife visited I could say “I love you” and be understood.
I was also beginning to understand what was being said. The first complete sentence I followed was in a conversation I overheard between a doctor and a physiotherapist: “I don’t think he will walk or talk again.” I decided then and there to prove them wrong.
By the time I was moved to the rehab centre in Market Harborough, where I was born, three weeks after my stroke, I was reading, talking and moving my legs in some semblance of walking.
The secret physio's diary: 'I talk to him about lifestyle changes. He glazes over' Read more
Then the serious rehab started. Every day I spent at least an hour in the gym, with exercises back in the ward too. The nursing assistants were a wonderful part of the team, becoming friends and gradually withdrawing assistance as I could do more. My speech had recovered well and all the visitors, many of whom I had not seen for 50 years, were the only speech therapy I needed.
After four weeks in the rehab centre I returned to my home, which had been prepared by the amazing NHS teams. They had turned the dining room into a fully equipped hospital room with electric adjustable bed and all the gadgets I could need. My downstairs bathroom had been changed to accommodate me, and as soon as I got home the team started to call. At least four times a week a pair of physiotherapists would treat me for an hour and an occupational therapist would come for at least an hour a week. At the end of six weeks of home treatment I could do everything I could do before my stroke – but slower and sometimes differently.
I’ve been told by several healthcare professionals that my attitude has made such a difference. I’ve never given up. I try to do whatever task is given to me without protest. And I’ve accepted that complete recovery is not reasonably achievable but I’m going to fight for every bit that is.
I was able to fly to Vancouver for Christmas with my kids and on the way over I tried to list all the people who made this trip possible in less than a year after my stroke, but it is impossible to do. There have been so many people, with so many skills, from so many ethnicities.
I thank you all in the NHS, the best medical system in the world.
I thank my family and friends who have continued to support me.
And I thank my wonderful wife."

The rising phenomenon of loneliness among older people needs to be addressed urgently otherwise the NHS risks being crippled by the costs of caring for isolated elderly patients in hospital, the NHS’s most senior acute care doctor has warned.
Failure to concentrate on this issue will lead to hospitals being transformed into “dormitories for older people” who have often been dispatched to A&E because they have no support structure at home.
Professor Keith Willett, director for acute care, with NHS England said: “The consequences are increasing, unremitting demand on healthcare which will ultimately cripple the NHS.”
His warning echoes a new drive launched by the Local Government Association (LGA), urging local councils to recognise loneliness as a “major public health concern”, which will put new strains on local services if it remains unaddressed.
The LGA will send a Combating Loneliness guide to the 370 councils it represents this week to highlight the health risks associated with loneliness. The publication cites research that suggests that loneliness can be more damaging than smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and quotes a study that found that lonely people have a 64% increased chance of developing clinical dementia.
Izzi Seccombe, LGA spokeswoman for public health, said: “As our population profile changes, and we have a larger proportion of over 65s and over 85s, loneliness is becoming an increasingly important public health concern.
“The impact of loneliness can be devastating and costly – with consequences comparable to smoking and obesity.”
Better solutions needed to support older people leaving hospital care Read more
The south west of England has a population age profile 10 to 15 years ahead of the rest of the country, thanks to Devon and Cornwall’s popularity as places to retire to in the UK. Research carried out in the region last year found that a third of patients admitted to A&E had very infrequent social interactions during the study period – less than once a month, or never. The research report concluded: “With social isolation strongly correlated with poor health outcomes, there is clearly work that could be done to improve the social interaction of the people in this study.”
Day care centres for the elderly can help alleviate this sense of isolation, but health care providers report that fewer people are accessing them, as a result of cuts to local authority budgets.
Dr Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “Services in the community, such as day centres for the elderly, can go a long way to alleviating loneliness and related conditions – but they are under considerable financial pressure. It’s really important that they are protected.”
Nuzhat Ali, older adults lead at Public Health England, said: “The health impact of loneliness is significant; in relation to older adults there is evidence that it impacts on depression, anxiety and low self-esteem. There is evidence to show that depression can progress the onset and speed with which dementia develops.”
Loneliness also reduces the speed with which older people recover from illnesses. Keith Willett said: “The low levels of mood, mild depression, that come from isolation and loneliness are significant contributors to patients not taking an interest in their care, because they feel noone else is interested in them.
“Low mood is not conducive to making a bouncy recovery. They may not look after themselves, they are not interested in their health, they may not bother to keep warm, they may not bother to take medication, because they don’t see a strong purpose.”
According to Willett, the practical consequences of older people living alone, without support, places a huge burden on the NHS, which becomes “the end point of a pathway where unsupported patients end up”. “It is a much wider societal problem”, which individuals, local authorities and the NHS have a joint responsibility to tackle, he added.
Willett advocates a transformation in the way the NHS looks after older people to “bring care to them at home”, to avoid the expensive, traumatic and unnecessary hospitalisation of older patients who would be much happier receiving care in the familiar setting of their own home.
“Older people who arrive in hospital usually spend longer in hospital, and that’s not ideal for them; that is not where they do well. They often have protracted stays, occupying acute facilities, when often they don’t have an acute medical problem, they really have a social care problem,” he said.
Under the current health care system patient support and care is provided “by moving them to a medical setting because we don’t provide it in a societal way in the community”, Willett said. “If that continues it will cripple the efficiency and effectiveness of our health care to those who do need acute care.”"

In December, after her third fall in a few months, Doris Carpenter was admitted to Rochdale infirmary. Carpenter is 84 and lives alone, but she is increasingly unsteady on her feet, and if she falls, she hasn’t the strength to get up again. Previously, a call to 111 would summon paramedics who could put her back into a chair, but it was increasingly clear she wasn’t coping, and needed more support.
This is not like any old hospital ward, however. Today Carpenter is not in bed but sitting in a chair, dressed in her own clothes, a fat Dan Brown book in front of her. “You don’t feel quite so much … like you’re in hospital,” she says. “Once they know you can move around they stop supervising you.”
Two side rooms have been furnished with small groups of tables and chairs, with bright crockery and tablecloths. Those patients who are able can help themselves to food at mealtimes and sit with others to eat, or go to the library to select another page-turner. A physiotherapist based in the unit helps Carpenter with her painful back, and is working to help improve her confidence on stairs.
Previously, an elderly person in Carpenter’s position would most likely have ended up in an acute hospital ward.
There, very frequently, people of her age and profile would get stuck, and many would go downhill fast.
“They come into hospital, and our model in the NHS is to put them to bed,” says Steve Taylor, the divisional director for integrated and community services at Pennine acute hospitals trust. “Put your pyjamas on, you stay in that bed, we will feed you and toilet you.”
Shockingly quickly, he says, patients can lose what abilities they previously had. “And then, when it comes time to discharge you, you can no longer walk.”

This is arguably the biggest challenge facing the NHS – the problem of an older population, the long years of infirmity that many of us will face and a fragile social care system underpinning it all.
The number of people aged over 80 in Britain is expected to more than double to more than 6 million by 2030; the number of people over 100 could rise ninefold from 13,000 to 111,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. About two-thirds of patients admitted to hospital are over 65, and this proportion is rising.
The only solution, many doctors and health managers believe, is to make the NHS work in an entirely new way, properly joining up medical services with social support. Integrating health services and local authority-provided social care alongside voluntary services has become an increasing priority for the NHS, and is now a key plank of planning for health providers. It’s just a matter of finding the best way to do it, and fast.
In Rochdale, the opportunity to rethink how care was provided came after the town’s Victorian infirmary was downgraded. No longer a busy district general hospital of 350 beds in which no fewer than five wards were full, most of the time, of frail elderly patients, its inpatient beds were slashed, at one point, to just 15.
The widespread ambition across the NHS to cut unnecessary hospital admissions of elderly people and reduce the length of their stays became an urgent one. But this was also an opportunity for Rochdale. If health and social care could work together, and people were properly supported to leave hospital quickly and return home, the stretched resources of both services could go so much further. After all, notes Taylor, if you can reduce the length of time someone stays in hospital from six days to two, 15 beds is the equivalent of 45.
“We have lots of beds, but most of them are out there,” says hospital consultant Shona McCallum, gesturing at the window. “The beds are their own beds.”
This principle - taking healthcare out of hospitals and into the homes of older people - is becoming increasingly widespread across the country as NHS managers and local authorities grapple with the burgeoning need. Two hundred and fifty miles from Rochdale, a new initiative in Croydon is seeking to address the same issue.
A targeted team, looking after 500 vulnerable older people, operates alongside an acute care of the elderly (ACE) service at Croydon University hospital. This new seven-day clinic gives rapid specialist assistance to people referred by their GPs or social workers, and helps to prevent them from being brought by ambulance to A&E. Those older patients who do turn up at casualty are fast-tracked to be seen by consultants, before (ideally) being discharged to continue treatment at home.
I’ve played golf since 1937, sometimes two rounds a day.
Every couple of weeks, Veronica Peters, a community nurse with Croydon’s health visiting team for older people, comes to visit Alfred Mann, a 103-year-old widower, who lives alone. His three daughters (in their 70s) shop for him, but Peters keeps a close watch on his health.
She has ordered bits of equipment that have helped him remain in the home where he has lived for the past 30 years: a rail by the back door and in the bathroom; a walking frame to let him continue gardening, and so he can get food from the kitchen to the room where he eats; and an emergency button he wears around his neck, in case he falls.
Peters has arranged for a physiotherapist to teach Mann exercises that have helped him to stay mobile. Before she began visiting him, he had had a few falls that without this practical assistance would probably have resulted in a hospital admission.
“I couldn’t manage without you, love. You’ve done so much for me,” he tells her, in the cheerful, energetic voice of a much younger man. He puts his good health down to gymnastics, his continued love of jazz music (he no longer plays the banjo because his hands are not up to it, but he listens to his records) and a lifetime spent playing golf (“I’ve played golf since 1937, sometimes two rounds a day. I was still playing at 100. Imagine all the miles I have completed.”).
He thinks he wouldn’t still be at home without the health team’s visits. “I wouldn’t be alive if it wasn’t for them. I have had wonderful treatment. I’m very very grateful for all the help they’ve given me.”

Bev Campbell, a social worker with the local council who helped develop the scheme, says the initiative was inspired by a conviction that early, preventative help at home would reduce the numbers of older people brought in by ambulance to accident and emergency at a later stage. She remembers one patient who staff saw at A&E over 100 times, who stopped attending once he was allocated a nurse to make regular visits to his home.
“He was ringing up ambulances purely because of the loneliness; he would call up and say he felt dizzy. He acknowledged that he was calling because he was lonely. He just wanted someone to recognise that he needed help,” Campbell said.
Many of the 500 clients the team sees in Croydon live alone. According to Gill Vincent-Clayden, another health visitor: “Loneliness is a major issue. They stop eating; it is such an effort to make a meal for one. They may begin to forget to look after themselves, stop washing themselves, changing their clothes; then they can get skin infections.
“A lot of our clients don’t have anyone else. Most are well over 85, have lost a lot of friends; they are housebound and we are the only people they see.”
Sometimes, although they have been living independently for years, their confidence takes a knock after a fall. “They start to be worried about going out. After that everything begins to fail; they don’t have anyone to talk to about it,” said Vincent-Clayden.
Patients are often on a trolley, rather than a bed. They might be surrounded by alcoholics, drug addicts
Dr Nima Hashemi, head of the ACE unit at Croydon University hospital, said the introduction of the service in 2012 meant fewer older people having the unhappy experience of waiting for treatment at A&E. “Patients are often on a trolley, rather than a bed, so may not be comfortable. They might be surrounded by alcoholics, drug addicts,” he said.
Since Hashemi’s clinic opened, the hospital’s A&E services have improved, because there are fewer older people with complex issues waiting there for medical help. The A&E department now sees at least 95% of its patients within four hours, up from 90% last year. The ACE unit, along with other initiatives designed to speed up the treatment of patients, has contributed to a fall in the number of hospital admissions by an average of 20 patients a day. Hashemi estimates that the the ACE unit’s work has potentially saved over £500,000 during the course of a year, as a result of reduced pressure on A&E and fewer beds being occupied.
Rochdale has also seen some striking results. When the local clinical commissioning group (CCG) – one of the GP-led bodies that buy services to deliver much of what the NHS does – wanted to recommission community services in the area, the hospital trust and Rochdale council got together with organisations including a local social enterprise and Age UK Rochdale, and tendered to jointly run “intermediate” services, targeted at people not quite well enough to be at home without support, but who really don’t need to be in hospital.
In September, the intermediate care tier service was launched, with the specific aim of reducing unnecessary hospital admissions and speeding up discharges. And by those measures it would already seem to be achieving dramatic results – surprising even those behind the scheme. In the four months to December, there were 864 fewer non-elective admissions to hospital in the Rochdale area than the previous year, a fall of more than 10%. In December, as the new system embedded, the reduction was 17.7%. The average length of stay in the two intermediate care units has fallen by 30% in one and 50% in the other.
Rochdale and Croydon are far from alone. A pilot integrated programme in Cornwall involving NHS providers, Cornwall council, Age UK and other voluntary groups, last year reported significant improvements in mental wellbeing and in feelings of loneliness among patients – and a 41% reduction in acute hospital costs. The charity is now rolling out the programme to other sites across the country.
Last March, NHS England announced 29 “vanguard” sites from Northumberland to Devon, which have been actively charged with developing creative new models of integrated health and social care. Perhaps most ambitiously of all, in April the 10 city and borough councils that make up Greater Manchester (including Rochdale), along with 27 other CCGs and hospital trusts, will assume collective responsibility for the entire region’s health and social care budgets – a £6bn experiment that represents one of the most dramatic reorganisations in NHS history.
Can integrating health and social care save the NHS? The challenges remain mind-boggling, but it is striking, if nothing else, that those involved on all sides – health providers, commissioners, local authorities and voluntary organisations – speak with enthusiasm and real optimism about what might be possible if only they can get it right."

Your focus on the vested interests of the food and drinks industries and their disastrous impact on the NHS begins to reveal where the government’s loyalties lie, and I hope you will be exploring the involvement of the insurance and health businesses with politicians and NHS bosses in the coming days.
A huge injection of funds is required with the utmost urgency, and has to come from central government, not by getting rid of vital staff as suggested by NHS England and Monitor (Hospitals told to shed staff as NHS funding crisis deepens, 30 January). I want to pay a hypothecated NHS income tax as soon as possible. I’d like to see a freeze on any further procurements and a big reduction in the army of back office staff who are there just to marketise the NHS. If we could claw back some of that annual cost, put at around £5bn, we’d be able to deal with a lot of the debts and begin to get to grips with provision of social care.
I also fear a big campaign to make people think the only answer is health insurance. How is it to be countered? Perhaps those considering taking that path should visit the website of Virginia Mason hospital, Jeremy Hunt’s ideal health provider in Seattle, and look at the section on billing and insurance. It is a not-for-profit business but you still need the right insurance package to be eligible to join, and it’s very complicated. A service that is both free at the point of use and properly funded through taxation is a much more efficient way of providing equitable, accessible and – as your series shows – mainly wonderful healthcare for everyone.

• The government know that the key to their devious and subversive plot to privatise the NHS has to be to soften up the public to the idea. This started years ago, even before Andrew Lansley blocked the release of a report praising the service, and continues with the almost daily denigration of the quality of care.
Much of the media seem to collude with this. The latest example is how the tragic case of baby William Mead was reported. NHS 111 failed on several occasions. Nowhere was it said that NHS 111 has been privatised and is run by Care UK, whose one-time chairman – and his wife – donated to the Tory party and to Lansley’s private office. It was portrayed purely as an “NHS” failure. Nor was it mentioned that Jeremy Hunt was warned years ago that NHS 111 was not “fit for purpose”, that its launch should be postponed and not rushed as it was, and that the downgrading of the call handlers from clinical to lay staff was dangerous.
Similarly, every time there is a nursing home scandal such as Winterbourne View, headlines warn of “NHS failure”, despite most of them being in private hands.
This is misleading the public to unfairly think the NHS is failing, when it is actually the privatised side that is letting down patients. The NHS is failing but only because of the lack of investment by this government – the lowest in the G7 – and the wasteful commercialisation.

The case for matching the average western European GDP health expenditure 10.3% is overwhelming Professor Colin Pritchard
• Based upon World Bank data, the proportion of UK national income (GDP) spent on health has fallen from a record high of 9.4% in 2010 to 9.1% by 2013.
Margaret Thatcher rightly said “we can only have the services we can afford”, but our research shows that we do not afford as much as most other western nations. For example, the fiscally prudent Germans spent 11.3% of GDP on health, the French 11.6% and the US 17.1%, and currently we are 18th out of 21 countries.
However, despite comparative chronic underfunding of the NHS, our forthcoming research shows that, in reducing cancer deaths and adult mortality, the NHS achieves proportionately more with relatively less – but for how long can this be maintained?
The case for matching the average western European GDP health expenditure 10.3% is overwhelming. If the public realised the comparative truth about NHS funding then there would likely be support to match the Europeans, possibly even if it meant 2p on income tax.

• When 45% of wards in England operate at unsafe levels and district nurse numbers have dropped 27% over the past four years, it is dangerous that hospitals “are being asked to shed staff to rescue the NHS from an acute funding crisis”. Instead, a “financial rescue” could come from two sources. The first is extremely simple. Cut a bigger slice of our GDP “cake” for healthcare. The second is for the government to buy out all private finance initiative schemes. Many hospitals are in deficit having to pay off PFI loans – £400m was spent to build Coventry’s University hospital, but the cost of building it through PFI will be £3.3bn. Overall, PFI deals have financed £11.8bn in building hospitals in England but will cost £79bn to pay back over 31 years, and the NHS spends more than £3,700 every minute to pay for privately financed hospitals. So buying them out now, particularly as interest rates are low, could save many billions to reinvest in the NHS.

• How could the Lib Dems in the coalition government have let the duty of the secretary of state for health to “provide” a health service be changed to the duty to “promote” a health service (Health and Social Care Act 2012)? What on earth were they thinking? The legal requirement to sustain a viable NHS was lost.

What we see now is Monitor asking trusts to cut staff in order to balance the books, while the government says they should increase staff to ensure patient safety. Meanwhile, a proposal from Norman Lamb and others, conveniently at arm’s length from the government, asks to set up a commission to look at how to fund the NHS. His bill is hastily scheduled for a second reading on 11 March, the very same day as Caroline Lucas’s private member’s bill on the NHS, which would reinstate the secretary of state’s duty to provide a service.
Private member’s bills are easily derailed. If you want Caroline Lucas to be given proper time for her bill, sign the petition asking Jeremy Corbyn to get Labour MPs to attend on 11 March. Go to tinyurl.com/nhsbill2016

• Once again we are reading that the NHS is in “deficit”. We are told that Addenbrooke’s hospital is “losing” £1.2m a week. As a solution to this, the “regulators” Monitor and something called the NHS Trust Development Authority demand a reduction in staff levels, ie fewer nurses. Obviously you can easily balance your books by doing this. It’s just a simple accounting device. Just might lead to suffering and death, but hey.

Jeremy Hunt is digging in for a series of strikes by junior doctors after peace talks intended to end the long-running dispute broke down and the NHS began preparing for a second walkout next week.
A week inside the NHS: Life, death and a perpetual balancing act Read more
The health secretary is resigned to junior doctors continuing to take industrial action, but he hopes that fewer medics will participate and is willing to impose the contract that sparked huge protests by trainee doctors if no deal is agreed.
The British Medical Association (BMA) confirmed on Monday that junior doctors in England would stage a second walkout next Wednesday, 10 February, for 24 hours from 8am, despite all sides agreeing that negotiations had produced good progress on key issues.
But the BMA decided not to proceed with a planned all-out strike between 8am and 5pm that day in case they lost the public support they have enjoyed until now. Instead, they will again withdraw from providing all care except emergency services, such as A&E, maternity care, intensive care and emergency surgery.
Thousands of planned operations and outpatient clinics will be postponed, like they were in the first strike by many of the 45,000 junior doctors in England on 12 January.
A source close to the talks said: “Jeremy Hunt’s strategy now is to exhaust the junior doctors, hope that more of them turn up for work during next week’s strike and hope that the industrial action fizzles out and then impose the contract in August.”
Talks that had been running since 1 December broke down, with both sides blaming what it portrayed as the other side’s intransigence for the failure to reach an agreement over whether some or much of Saturday should become part of a junior doctor’s normal working week.
The BMA angrily criticised what it said was ministers’ unhelpfully “entrenched” stance on Saturday working in the talks.
Dr Johann Malawana, the chair of the BMA’s junior doctors committee, said: “The government’s position – based on ideology rather than reason – risks souring relations with an entire generation of junior doctors, the very doctors who the secretary of state has acknowledged as the backbone of the NHS.
“The government’s entrenched position in refusing to recognise Saturday working as unsocial hours, together with its continued threat to impose a contract so fiercely resisted by junior doctors across England, leaves us with no alternative but to continue with industrial action.”
Malawana said that, despite two months of talks, “we have seen no willingness on their part to move on a core issue for junior doctors up and down the country”.
Sir David Dalton, the chief executive of Salford Royal NHS foundation trust who Hunt recently appointed as the government’s lead negotiator in the talks, agreed that Saturday was “the key area of difference” preventing a settlement. But he claimed that the impasse was because the BMA had broken a previous pledge to negotiate on the issue.
He said it had promised to do so on 30 November, when the Advisory, Conciliation and Advisory Service (Acas) became involved, but had refused point blank to do so recently, Dalton said in a letter to Hunt updating him on progress. “It is very disappointing that the BMA continues to refuse to negotiate on the issues of unsocial hours payment,” he said.
The normal working week for junior doctors, for which they receive basic pay, is from 7am to 7pm Monday to Friday. Hunt initially wanted to extend that to 10pm on weekdays and include 7am to 10pm on Saturdays.
Time is running out to save our chronically underfunded NHS | Letters Read more
Recent concessions by Hunt and Dalton – that normal or “plain time” could end at 9pm on weekdays and 5pm on Saturdays – proved insufficient to sway the BMA. The doctors’ union wants all of Saturday to continue to attract lucrative overtime payments.
Dalton said there was no point in any further talks until the BMA agreed to negotiate on “principal outstanding issues”, notably pay for Saturday working.
A Department of Health spokesman said: “It is regrettable that the BMA is proceeding with further unnecessary industrial action. Sir David Dalton’s published summary of negotiations shows how close we are to agreeing a deal and demonstrates our strong desire to resolve the key substantive issue of pay for unsocial hours, as both parties agreed to do with Acas back in November.
“As Sir David recommends, we want to settle this so that we can improve the standard of care for patients at weekends.”"

GPs have been urged not to stop visiting and treating the 400,000 residents of care homes as part of their effort to reduce their “unsustainable” workload.
The British Medical Association has denied reports that family doctors intend to withdraw from that role, but says it wants changes to the way people living in care and nursing homes are looked after.
Doctors who specialise in older people’s medical care want GPs to continue servicing care homes and warned the doctors’ union against treating residents differently to other patients.
Prof David Oliver, president of the British Geriatrics Society, said: “We must ensure that care-home residents can continue to access the healthcare services they need.
“We call on the BMA and GPs to ensure that, in protecting the future sustainability of their services, they do not classify care-home residents as anything less than full members of society, with the same healthcare entitlements as the rest of us.”
The BMA agreed that residents should receive high-quality care but wants that to become the responsibility of new teams of hospital doctors and nurses as well as GPs.
Representatives of the UK’s 45,000 GPs met at the weekend to discuss ways of relieving the strain on what the BMA called “hugely overstretched” GP services. They want the union to talk to ministers about making care-home residents the subject of a contract separate to the contract under which GPs currently operate, which makes clear that they must look after such patients as part of their duties.
Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the BMA’s GPs’ committee, said the current set-up had led to a piecemeal service that was not doing justice to those in care homes.
“This is not about GPs not looking after patients in care homes or withdrawing services,” Nagpaul said. “It is about them being able to provide focused care with the right resources and range of other staff to ensure that older patients with multiple medical needs get the service they deserve.”
He added many care-home residents would previously have been in long-stay hospital beds, but the government agenda of moving care out of hospitals means that many patients with specialist needs are now in community settings, “yet without providing such patients with the dedicated, specialist and coordinated support they need.”
But Prof Oliver, however, stressed that, under the terms of the NHS Constitution, Equality Act and the current General Medical Services contract that many GPs operate under, the older people are entitled to the same level of access to a full range of healthcare services as all other citizens.
“This is not simply respecting older people’s rights; it is also the right thing to do for our highly pressurised health and care systems,” he said.
The Department of Health said: “GPs are contracted to ensure their patients receive full and proper standards of care, and that includes carrying out home visits where necessary.”"
Cannabis|Colorado|Denver|Kansas|Drugs|Post-traumatic stress disorder|news,2016-02-01T20:34:26,guardian,Josiah Hesse,"Tensions running high between courts, family attorneys and child protective services, who are unsure where lines are drawn in a world of legalized cannabis",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/01/medical-marijuana-use-colorado-kansas-veteran-custody-battle,US veteran’s children taken away over his use of medical marijuana,en,UK|society,,"Tensions running high between courts, family attorneys and child protective services, who are unsure where lines are drawn in a world of legalized cannabis
When Raymond Schwab talks about his case, his voice teeters between anger and sadness.
“People who don’t understand the medical value of cannabis are tearing my family apart,” says the Kansas father and US veteran, who has a prescription for marijuana in neighboring Colorado, where it is legal.
Nine months ago, Schwab tried to move to Colorado to grow medical marijuana for fellow veterans. While he and his wife were there preparing for the move, the state of Kansas took five of their children, ages 5 to 16, into custody on suspicion of child endangerment, ensnaring his family in interstate marijuana politics.
Cases like the Schwabs’ have become a lightning rod for marijuana activists and have left courts, family attorneys and Child Protective Services (CPS) unsure of where the lines are drawn in this brave new world of legalized cannabis.
“There’s still a stigma against parents who use medical marijuana,” says Jennifer Ani, a family law attorney who says she sees around five similar cases a month – in 95% of which she believes the child was in no reasonable danger. “As much as marijuana is a moving target throughout the nation, with Child Protective Services it’s even more so.”
She says that concerns about contact-highs or children eating raw cannabis are often cited but are not scientifically sound arguments that a child is in danger. Contact-highs have been widely discredited as a myth, and cannabis must be cooked before it can get you high.
The US Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment on the Schwab case but pointed us to their guide “Parental Drug Use As Child Abuse”, which says that “exposing children to the manufacture, possession, or distribution of illegal drugs is considered child endangerment in 11 States [including Kansas]” and “the Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act requires states to have policies and procedures in place to notify child protective services agencies of substance-exposed newborns”.
A case like Schwab’s has one foot in both the legal and illegal dynamics of marijuana, since his case involves Kansas, where cannabis remains illegal, and Colorado, where it is legal for both medical and recreational sale.
Tensions have been running high between Colorado and neighboring states whose residents want to purchase cannabis. Last year, sheriffs from Nebraska, Oklahoma and Kansas filed a lawsuit against the state for its marijuana laws, citing trafficking concerns; and this month, the Kansas attorney general sent out 500 surveys to their county and district attorneys, sheriffs and chiefs of police asking how Colorado marijuana is affecting their work.
A US navy veteran who served in the Gulf war, Schwab says that he uses a homemade cannabis butter to treat his post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, and chronic pain. For years, he says, his mental health issues went undiagnosed, resulting in a bout of alcoholism and substance abuse. He was prescribed a variety of sedatives, antidepressants and chronic pain medication, which he says often made him feel worse. “I got addicted to the pain medication, which led to heroin addiction.”
Schwab says that he has been sober since a stint in rehab in 2011, and that cannabis is the only medication that helps with his anxiety, depression and physical pain.
Schwab arranged in early 2015 for his job at the Department of Veterans Affairs to be transferred from Kansas to Colorado, where he could legally grow his own cannabis and work with veterans who, like him, use the plant medicinally.
While dealing with the move, he and Amelia arranged for the five children to stay with relatives. (The four youngest children were born to Raymond and his wife, Amelia; the 16-year-old and a 19-year-old who was not taken into custody are Amelia’s children from previous relationships.) After driving 60 miles away from home, the Schwabs received a call saying they needed to appear in an emergency hearing that day because their children were in state custody.
Schwab says that one of the relatives caring for his children (whom he declines to name) took them to the police station, saying their parents had abandoned them to go work on a pot farm in Colorado. That was in April last year, and Schwab says he has only seen his children three times since then.
The communications director for the Kansas department of children and families (DCF) declined to comment on the Schwab case but said that “children are not removed from the home for [parental] marijuana use alone”.
Yet Schwab says that no investigation was done of him or his home, and that the only evidence against him was the testimony of the police officer that took the children into custody. There were allegations of “emotional abuse” but a DCF report in July found those to be “unsubstantiated”.
Included in the police report was a screenshot of Schwab’s recent Facebook post, where he discusses moving to Colorado to start a marijuana business. The Schwabs have been asked to submit a urine sample that would be tested to see if they have used marijuana before they can visit their children – despite having relocated to Colorado, where he has a prescription.
The district attorney of Riley County, Kansas, where the Schwabs’ case is currently being handled, did not return requests for an interview.
Ani says that it’s not unusual to see children removed from their home for marijuana use, even in states where it’s legal. In 2014 she defended a California couple whose children were taken by CPS after a police officer smelled marijuana in the house, despite having prescriptions for the substance. The additional charge against them was that their home was in disarray.
Last year, Ani worked on the highly publicized Kansas case of Shona Banda, whose 11-year-old son was taken from her after he told his drug education program teacher that his mother used cannabis.
For cases like Schwab’s, the legal spiderweb of cannabis law becomes compounded by his PTSD.
Dr Sue Sisley – a psychiatrist who recently received a $2m grant to study the effects of cannabis in treating PTSD, the first study of its kind – says that for vets like Schwab, “they need their medicine in order to be a good parent”.
“A lot of these vets, they can’t function without their meds. And they have to live in fear of a positive drug test, and losing their kids to Child Protective Services. So they live this crazy, covert lifestyle where they’re afraid to be open to the people around them, for fear that they’ll call CPS.”
Last month, Schwab testified before a Kansas state senate committee and, with tears in his eyes, pleaded for the state to “give me back my children”.
The committee was considering a bill that aimed to lower criminal penalties for marijuana possession and allow hemp oil to be used medicinally – moves that he criticized for not going far enough.
Schwab says that once he regains custody of his children he plans to sue the state of Kansas for violation of his constitutional rights. “They’re holding my kids hostage and threatening to terminate my rights if I don’t seek cannabis-abuse therapy in a state that’s legal. They’re threatening other people with jail time or losing their kids if they speak out, but I will not submit. I’ll take this to the supreme court if I have to.”"

China has sentenced two men to death for killing a British monk who founded Europe’s first Tibetan monastery, state media said.
Chöje Akong Tulku Rinpoche, co-founder of Scotland’s Kagyu Samye Ling monastery near Langholm, in Dumfries and Galloway, was found dead with multiple stab wounds at his home in the south-western city of Chengdu in 2013.
A court in the city sentenced two men, named in Chinese as Tudeng Gusang and Tsering Banjue, to death for the murders of Akong Rinpoche and two other men, while an accomplice was sentenced to three years in jail, the state-run China News Service reported late on Sunday.
It cited authorities as saying that Gusang, who had worked at the Scottish monastery, and Banjue had stabbed Akong Rinpoche, his nephew and a driver to death in a dispute over a 2.7m yuan (£286,000) payment.

The verdict, posted by the court on social media, said the murders were “brutal” and that the suspects would be “treated severely in accordance with the law”.
Britain said in a statement that it communicated its opposition to the death penalty to Beijing.
Akong Rinpoche, who was in his early 70s, took British citizenship after fleeing Tibet in 1959, and founded the monastery in 1967. He had the title of Rinpoche, an honorific given to the most respected teachers in Tibetan Buddhism, and his community said at the time of his killing that he had been “assassinated”.
The institution was a pilgrimage site for artists and musicians including Leonard Cohen as well as senior Tibetan monks including the Dalai Lama.
Despite fleeing China, Akong Rinpoche had maintained a relationship with the authorities in Beijing, regularly returning to Tibetan regions.
Many Tibetans say that China represses their religious freedom and culture. Beijing says it has brought massive investment to the relatively undeveloped region.

Rights groups say China executes more people than the rest of the world combined, though the annual number sentenced to death has declined significantly over the past decade. Beijing regards the figure as a state secret and does not release it.
The British embassy in Beijing said it was aware of the outcome of the trial, adding: “The British government maintains its longstanding opposition to the death penalty, and has formally communicated this to the Chinese government.”"

A British tourist has been killed after he was thrown from an elephant during a trek in Thailand.
Gareth Crowe, 36, was taking part in a trek on the island of Koh Samui when the animal turned on its handler, according to local reports. He was on holiday in Thailand with his family.
A 16-year-old girl, the daughter of Crowe’s partner, was injured after she also fell to the ground.
Witnesses said the elephant – known as Golf – grew angry after its handler climbed down to take photographs, refusing to follow his instructions. The handler is said to have hit the elephant several times, which then stabbed him with a tusk before rising up and throwing the tourists off.

Crowe’s partner, Catherine Hughes, 42, spoke on Monday from the hospital where her daughter, named as Eilidh Hughes, was recovering.
She said: “We were all here on holiday. My son and I didn’t go on the elephants. I’ve been given no information as to what happened or how it happened. Eilidh is OK but I don’t know exactly what happened.”
The teenager was first treated at Samui International hospital before she was moved to the island’s Bangkok International hospital. Her family are believed to have originally been from the Isle of Islay off Scotland’s Argyll coast, but moved to the Scottish mainland two years ago.
A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “We are offering support to the family of a British national who has sadly died following an incident in Koh Samui, Thailand, and are making contact with the local authorities to seek further information.”
The local Thai provincial governor, Wongsiri Phromchana, said that an investigation was being launched into the incident, adding that there were at least five elephant camps on Koh Samui providing treks and activities for tourists.
Animal charities have been calling on tourists to think carefully before they take part in wild animal experiences. World Animal Protection said thoughts were with the family of the man who died but added that the incident was a “stark reminder” that elephants are not meant to be ridden.
A spokeswoman said: “Elephants are cruelly abused to tame them enough so they give rides and perform in shows.
“Most tourists don’t know about these abuses, or the potential danger they put themselves in. If you can ride it, hug it or have a selfie with a wild animal, then the chances are it is cruel and the animal is suffering.”
Last year, tour operator Intrepid Travel announced it would no longer offer elephant rides on any of its trips. STA Travel, which provides holidays for 2.5 million students and young people each year, last year also stopped offering tours that include elephant rides or trips to the Tiger Temple in Thailand."
LGBT rights|Opinion|Northern Ireland|Religion|Gay marriage|Sexuality|Cake|comment,2016-02-01T08:46:38,guardian,Peter Tatchell,I profoundly disagree with Ashers Bakery’s opposition to same-sex love – but believe the discrimination verdict infringes vital freedoms,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/gay-cake-row-i-changed-my-mind-ashers-bakery-freedom-of-conscience-religion,I’ve changed my mind on the gay cake row. Here’s why,en,opinion,,"Like most gay and equality campaigners, I initially condemned the Christian-run Ashers Bakery in Belfast over its refusal to produce a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan for a gay customer, Gareth Lee. I supported his legal claim against Ashers and the subsequent verdict – the bakery was found guilty of discrimination last year. Now, two days before the case goes to appeal, I have changed my mind. Much as I wish to defend the gay community, I also want to defend freedom of conscience, expression and religion.
The saga began in 2014 when the bakery said it was not willing to ice a cake with the words “support gay marriage” and the logo of the equality group Queer Space, claiming the message was contrary to its Christian beliefs. This struck many of us as anti-gay discrimination based on religious-inspired homophobic prejudice. Ashers believes that the relationships of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people are wrong and should not be eligible for the status of marriage. They translated these beliefs into action and declined to make the cake. Ashers would have decorated a cake with a message celebrating traditional heterosexual marriage and promoting a Christian organisation. Surely this was an example of clear-cut anti-gay discrimination?
The ‘gay cake’ ruling is a victory for equality in Northern Ireland | Joshua Rozenberg Read more
Gareth Lee’s legal case against Ashers was backed by the Equality Commission of Northern Ireland. It argued that the bakery’s actions breached Northern Ireland’s Equality Act and Fair Employment and Treatment Order, which prohibit discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services on the respective grounds of sexual orientation and political opinion. Last May a Belfast court found Ashers guilty of discrimination on both grounds, ordering it to pay Lee £500 compensation.
I profoundly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to same-sex love and marriage, and support protests against them. They claim to be Christians, yet Jesus never once condemned homosexuality, and discrimination is not a Christian value. Ashers’ religious justifications are, to my mind, theologically unsound. Nevertheless, on reflection the court was wrong to penalise Ashers and I was wrong to endorse its decision.
The law suit against the bakery was well-intended. It sought to challenge homophobia. But it was a step too far. It pains me to say this, as a long-time supporter of the struggle for LGBT equality in Northern Ireland, where same-sex marriage and gay blood donors remain banned. The equality laws are intended to protect people against discrimination. A business providing a public service has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on race, gender, faith and sexuality.
However, the court erred by ruling that Lee was discriminated against because of his sexual orientation and political opinions.
The Ashers verdict could encourage far-right extremists to demand the promotion of anti-migrant and anti-Muslim opinions
His cake request was refused not because he was gay, but because of the message he asked for. There is no evidence that his sexuality was the reason Ashers declined his order. Despite this, Judge Isobel Brownlie said that refusing the pro-gay marriage slogan was unlawful indirect sexual orientation discrimination. On the question of political discrimination, the judge said Ashers had denied Lee service based on his request for a message supporting same-sex marriage. She noted: “If the plaintiff had ordered a cake with the words ‘support marriage’ or ‘support heterosexual marriage’ I have no doubt that such a cake would have been provided.” Brownlie thus concluded that by refusing to provide a cake with a pro-gay marriage wording Ashers had treated him less favourably, contrary to the law.
This finding of political discrimination against Lee sets a worrying precedent. Northern Ireland’s laws against discrimination on the grounds of political opinion were framed in the context of decades of conflict. They were designed to heal the sectarian divide by preventing the denial of jobs, housing and services to people because of their politics. There was never an intention that this law should compel people to promote political ideas with which they disagreed.

The judge concluded that service providers are required to facilitate any “lawful” message, even if they have a conscientious objection. This raises the question: should Muslim printers be obliged to publish cartoons of Mohammed? Or Jewish ones publish the words of a Holocaust denier? Or gay bakers accept orders for cakes with homophobic slurs? If the Ashers verdict stands it could, for example, encourage far-right extremists to demand that bakeries and other service providers facilitate the promotion of anti-migrant and anti-Muslim opinions. It would leave businesses unable to refuse to decorate cakes or print posters with bigoted messages.
In my view, it is an infringement of freedom to require businesses to aid the promotion of ideas to which they conscientiously object. Discrimination against people should be unlawful, but not against ideas."

It's done out of love for God',en,UK|northern ireland,,"Daniel and Amy McArthur say they have no regrets about refusing to bake cake with pro-gay marriage message on it
An evangelical Christian couple at the centre of the “gay cake” court case have insisted they never meant to discriminate against anyone and do not hate gay people.
Daniel and Amy McArthur also said the case against them last year had strengthened their marriage.
Ashers Baking Company was found guilty last year by a county court in Northern Ireland of breaking the province’s strict laws on political and sexual discrimination. The case centred on the McArthurs’ refusal to bake a cake with a pro-gay marriage message on it.
They were taken to court by the Equality Commission of Northern Ireland and the couple were fined £500. They are appealing against the ruling, and are being supported by the Christian Institute, which released a statement from the McArthurs before their court of appeal hearing in Belfast on Wednesday.
Daniel McArthur said: “It was clear we did not hate anyone. We didn’t want to discriminate against anyone. We did what we did because of our Christian beliefs. It’s done out of love for God, to obey Him.”
He also criticised the Equality Commission, which he accused of being “very one-sided.”
“They wanted to pursue it with everything they had,” Daniel McArthur said. “They wanted to take us to court, maybe teach us a lesson or send out a signal. The signal they were trying to send out was: If you’re a Christian don’t bring it into work.”
Amy McArthur said: “This case has been a blessing in our marriage. God has used this to strengthen our marriage and our relationship with God. We have to trust in him and we have seen him answer our prayers time and time again.”

The McArthurs disclosed that Ashers Bakery in central Belfast has suffered some minor acts of vandalism on their premises since the case came to light but the company has not suffered financially.
Daniel McArthur added that he and his wife had no regrets in taking a stand over the cake.
“If you came to me and you said: would we go through it again? I would say yes.
“And I would say to other Christians facing pressure at work or in public life: don’t be afraid to take your Christian stand because we’ve learned God is with you in all of it and he gives you the grace to stand against these trials and challenges.”
The couple were originally members of the Free Presbyterian Church, founded by the late Rev Ian Paisley. The pair, who met while doing missionary work in the Philippines, now worship at Trinity Reformed Presbyterian church in Mossley, in the northern outskirts of Belfast."
Terry Wogan|Opinion|Ireland|Europe|Northern Ireland|comment,2016-02-01T19:46:19,guardian,Martin Kettle,"The broadcaster made his name during the Troubles, when anti-Irish prejudice in Britain was rife. He showed what the people of both islands have in common",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/terry-wogan-irish-troubles-prejudice-britain,Why it matters that Terry Wogan was Irish,en,opinion,,"In the flood of tributes to Terry Wogan, many of the late broadcaster’s enduring qualities have been remembered: his seemingly indestructible niceness, his mischievous wit, his relaxed professionalism at the microphone, his gift of connection with his listeners. The front pages of the Sun and the Daily Mirror today summed them up: “Thank you for being our friend.”
Yet, with the occasional exception, few of the British tributes lingered long, or at all, on what was surely one of Wogan’s most interesting other qualities – his Irishness. Perhaps this was so obvious as not to require comment or deconstruction by his legions of British admirers. Yet it was an odd omission, given the scale of the tributes, and it was not one that was missed in Ireland itself, where the president, Michael D Higgins, and the prime minister, Enda Kenny, were quick to celebrate the Limerick-born broadcaster’s role as “a bridge between Britain and Ireland”, as Kenny put it.
Sir Terry Wogan: tributes to BBC broadcaster dead aged 77 - as they happened Read more
Wogan rarely drew explicit attention to his Irishness. And yet, although he lived, worked and died in Britain, was knighted by the Queen, and was never reluctant to wave the union jack when the needs of the BBC required it, his Irishness was there whenever he opened his mouth. For more than 40 years he was probably the most prominent Irish person, and certainly the most familiar Irish voice, in Britain, rivalled for fame only by George Best and Bono, neither of whom could match Wogan’s length of time in the spotlight.
Yet those four decades coincided with some of the darkest of times in the British-Irish relationship. They were the years of the Northern Ireland Troubles, of internment, of the Provisional IRA’s bombing campaigns and of Britain’s first anti-terrorism laws of the modern era, directed explicitly against Irish republicans.
They were also years in which anti-Irish prejudice in Britain was often not far from the surface, especially while Wogan was beginning to make his name.
So, whether he liked it or not, Wogan was a significant Irish presence in Britain right through the era of Gerry Adams and Ian Paisley. To some Irish nationalist eyes that may perhaps brand him as someone who made dubious accommodations with Britishness at a sensitive time. To his British listeners, however, and possibly to many of his Irish ones too, Wogan was a reminder that there was also much more to the British-Irish relationship than nationalist and loyalist politics, and that people on both sides of the Irish Sea have more in common than some of them sometimes like to pretend.
In this respect, Wogan was of course a prominent part of a long and continuing tradition. The old crack that says Britain gave Ireland its language and that in return Ireland gave Britain its literature may be false in many ways, yet remains absolutely true in others.
But Ireland, north and south, has also given Britain many of its most familiar microphone voices too, from This Is Your Life’s Eamonn Andrews and chatshow host Graham Norton to sports commentators Peter O’Sullevan and Alan Green.
Not all great Irish broadcasters are lured to Britain, of course, as the career of Gay Byrne exemplifies above all others. Yet it is hard to think of one who reached across the political and cultural barriers to the extent that Wogan did.
To reflect on Wogan’s Irishness is neither to extol nor exaggerate his influence. However popular Wogan may have been, and however much he may have been a kind of cultural bridge – even a very important one – it would be hard to argue that he changed the British-Irish relationship in any significant way. What he did, perhaps, was to use his personality to ensure the relationship didn’t get worse at a time that it could easily have done so.
Wogan was indeed “our” friend. Like all those whose lives and examples strengthen friendships across divisive borders, he deserves honour and praise.

But sentimentality on this count at least is out of place. Ignorance about Ireland remains appallingly widespread at the time of Wogan’s death. A general election is expected to be announced in the Irish Republic tomorrow, but it will be largely neglected in Britain.
The centenary of the Easter Rising in April has generated little interest on this side of the Irish Sea, even though, as Fintan O’Toole wrote in the Guardian today, it was a foundation event not only of modern Ireland but also of a United Kingdom that sometimes feels close to collapse.
There are no firm plans yet for RTE’s new drama series Rebellion, set at the time of the Easter Rising, to be shown in the UK. Wogan’s Irishness was a reminder of how much these two islands share, but also of how closed the British mind can still be to many of the realities of modern Ireland."

Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of Wales and northern England have been warned to expect bad weather overnight on Monday and into Tuesday as Storm Henry bears down on Britain.
High winds are forecast across Scotland, which has been issued an amber warning, the second most severe. Gusts of 70mph-80mph are now expected, while 90mph is possible in the most exposed areas, especially across the Western Isles and along the west coast.

Less severe yellow warnings were put in place in England as far south as the Humber, all of Northern Ireland and the northern tip of Wales. The Met Office issued yellow warnings for heavy rain in the Highlands, Strathclyde and Central, Tayside and Fife and the Outer Hebrides areas.
Storm Henry comes soon after Gertrude, which brought gusts of more than 100mph in places, as well as heavy rain and snow.
“An area of low pressure is moving east across the Atlantic, deepening as it does so, before arriving across the north-west of the UK on Monday,” the Met Office’s chief forecaster’s assessment read.
“Gale to severe gale-force, west to south-westerly winds are expected to develop on the southern and western flanks of this system, firstly affecting western Scotland from late afternoon before progressing east through the evening and overnight. Storm-force winds are likely in the most exposed areas.
“Winds should ease early on Tuesday morning as the system clears away to the north-east.”
Forecasters also warned of large waves that could lead to flooding on coastal roads.
Scotland’s transport minister, Derek Mackay, said there was “every likelihood” for travel disruption over the coming days. “The wintry weather is forecast to deteriorate tomorrow with the arrival of Storm Henry, which carries an amber alert for high winds from Monday afternoon, continuing through the peak on Tuesday morning.
On Saturday, routes in Tayside were affected by snow, with collisions reported during the morning, particularly on the A90. Motorists were advised to avoid the A9 at Drumochter Pass, Dalwhinnie, because of the heavy snow. On the A82, the snow gates were closed at Tyndrum, Bridge of Orchy and Glencoe.
The gates were also closed on the A93 from Braemar to Glenshee, the A939 from Tomintoul to Cock Bridge, and the A821 Duke’s Pass.
Caledonian MacBrayne was advising ferry passengers to check ahead for disruptions across the network.
Ross Moran, operations general manager, said: “Storm Henry is set to present significant operational challenges. As with any adverse weather, we would ask passengers to consider whether their journey is absolutely necessary and to regularly check for route disruptions across the network.
“Our website, Twitter and app all provide continuously updated travel information – our customer services team keeps these channels absolutely current and they all provide the best and latest details of our operations.
“We are committed to working as hard as possible to deliver optimal service cover, but with such adverse conditions predicted, widespread disruption is likely.”"

She was one of the few surviving members of Lt Gen Sir Frederick Morgan’s staff charged in 1943-44 with planning the invasion of north-west Europe.
Ginge was born in Swansea, south Wales. Her mother, Eleanor, died in childbirth and her father, Bill, a teacher, when she was 13. She left school at 14 and took a course at secretarial college. Her first job was in Swansea’s Guildhall as the town clerk’s secretary.
In 1943 she volunteered to join the Wrens as a shorthand typist. She was spotted by Morgan who, as chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (Designate), was planning Operation Overlord. Until March 1944, she was his shorthand typist and secretary. It was secret and hard work: “I used to go to sleep singing songs in shorthand.” The discretion and sense of duty that Morgan identified were valued qualities throughout her life; so too were dedication and loyalty.
In 1944 Morgan was appointed deputy chief of staff to General Dwight D Eisenhower. To his regret he was unable to take Ginge with him and she returned to the Navy. He wrote to Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, the allied naval commander: “I should like you to know that in my experience, which is not small, I consider the work of Wren Thomas to be of the first order … Were she in my service, I should have no hesitation in recommending her for promotion and for commissioned rank.”
Ginge had the satisfaction of seeing the plans she knew all about being implemented. She accompanied Ramsay to France and Germany in September 1944: “We had typed about it hundreds of times, but were now seeing it for the first time.” Ginge was awarded the British Empire Medal in 1946. In the same year, she married Clark Thomas, one of the Desert Rats who fought in North Africa, and they went on to have two sons, Michael and Steven.
All who encountered Ginge at the University College of Swansea shared Morgan’s view of her. Professor Sir Glanmor Williams wrote of the secretary he appointed in 1960 to the history department: “Ginge proved to be indispensable to staff and students alike … Over all the years we worked together – a quarter of a century − I found her an absolute treasure to whom I owed an incalculable debt.” Her standing among the university’s secretarial staff made her an obvious choice as secretary of the university branch of the Nalgo union. Her experience, determination and firm reasonableness ensured that the status of the university’s secretarial staff improved.
After retirement in 1984, Ginge devoted herself to family, friends and her church. Clark died in 2008 and Michael in 2009. She is survived by Steven and by a grandson, David."

The human animal knows that it is born to age and die. Together with language, this knowledge is what separates us from all other species. Yet, until the 18th century, not even Aristotle, who speculated about most things, actually considered the possibility of extinction.
This is all the more surprising because “the end of the world” is an archetypal theme with a sonorous label – eschatology – that morphs in popular culture into many doomsday scenarios, from global warming to the third world war. Citizens of the 21st century now face a proliferating menu of possible future dooms.
Elizabeth Kolbert’s The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History is both a highly intelligent expression of this genre and also supremely well executed and entertaining. Her book, which follows her global warming report Field Notes from a Catastrophe (2006), is already set to become a contemporary classic, and an excellent place to start this new series of landmark nonfiction titles in the English language.
The 100 best nonfiction books of all time Read more
On the opening page of her investigation into the future of our planet, Kolbert quotes the great biologist EO Wilson: “If there is danger in the human trajectory, it is not so much in the survival of our own species as in the fulfilment of the ultimate irony of organic evolution: that in the instant of achieving self-understanding through the mind of man, life has doomed its most beautiful creations.” This warning note sets the mood for the 13 chapters that follow, an urgent contemporary report on “the sixth extinction”.
Kolbert’s perspective is both awe-inspiring and fearsome, but utterly engrossing, as you’d expect from a book whose premise is “we’re all doomed”. During the past half billion years, she tells us, there have been five mass extinctions on Earth, when “the planet has undergone change so wrenching that the diversity of life has plummeted”.
The history of these catastrophic events, notes Kolbert, tends to be recaptured just as humanity comes to realise that it is about to cause another one. Sure enough, in our postmillennial century, she finds that scientists around the world are now monitoring the next mass extinction, possibly the biggest devastation since an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs. With this difference: the impending cataclysm is… us.
Part of Kolbert’s concern is to educate the modern reader in the history of mass extinction, a comparatively recent idea
In 13 emblematic episodes, exquisitely narrated, Kolbert, a magazine journalist with the New Yorker, explores the possibility of our impending doom through the lives of, for instance, the Panamanian golden frog, the Sumatran rhino and the black-faced honeycreeper of Maui, “the most beautiful bird in the world”.
Part of Kolbert’s concern is to educate the modern reader in the history of mass extinction. While the concept, as she puts it, “may be the first scientific idea that kids have to grapple with”, as they play with their toy dinosaurs, Kolbert instructs that, actually, it’s a comparatively recent idea that dates to Enlightenment France. Until this moment in the western intellectual tradition, not even Aristotle (in his 10-volume History of Animals) had so much as considered the possibility that animals had a past. Later, in Roman times, Pliny’s Natural History includes descriptions of animals that are real, or fabulous, but none that are extinct. The word “fossil” was used to describe anything dug from the ground, as in “fossil fuel”. Even Carl Linnaeus, who pioneered his system of binomial nomenclature in the mid-18th century, catalogued only one kind of animal – those that exist.

It was the discovery of some American mastodon bones in what is now Ohio, during the early 18th century – an unintended consequence of French colonial exploration – that subsequently inspired Georges Cuvier, an anatomist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, to ask the essential question: “What was this primitive Earth? … And what revolution was able to wipe it out?”
Revolutionary France celebrated the rights of man. Cuvier was never going to recognise the truth about some later extinctions: that Homo sapiens is the problem, not the solution. Addressing the imminent next catastrophe with a certain grim relish, Kolbert spells out the results of her investigations: “One-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater molluscs, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed towards oblivion,” she declares, during the course of her odyssey through our natural world and its human-inspired devastation. Kolbert’s indictment of humanity is remorseless, and compelling: “The losses are occurring all over: in the South Pacific, in the North Atlantic, in the Arctic and in the Sahel, in lakes and on islands, on mountaintops and in valleys.”
Homo sapiens may have enjoyed brilliant success but we have done so at the expense of virtually every other species
Readers of The Sixth Extinction will be unable to evade the conclusion that we do indeed find ourselves on the brink of a great catastrophe, one in which the agent involved is not an inanimate object (such as an asteroid) or a geophysical force (such as the extreme global warming disaster of 250m years ago) but a sentient creature: ourselves. Homo sapiens may have enjoyed brilliant success on Earth but we have done so at the expense of virtually every other species. We are, as the Observer’s Robin McKie has put it, “the neighbours from hell”.
The Sixth Extinction ends in a windowless room at the Institute for Conservation Research in California known as the Frozen Zoo, the world’s largest collection of species on ice. This, suggests Kolbert, may be the slender thread on which life on Earth will depend in future. Who knows? She underlines her final message with a quotation from the Stanford ecologist Paul R Erhlich: “IN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.”
We have been warned.
A signature line
“The Sixth Extinction will continue to determine the course of life long after everything people have written and painted and built has been ground into dust and giant rats have – or have not – inherited the Earth.”

In last Thursday’s debate, the last before tonight’s Iowa caucus votes, on Fox News of all networks, there was one brief climate question directed at Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL). Unfortunately it was framed as a ‘gotcha, flip-flop’ question, with Rubio asked about his apparent support 8 years ago for a carbon cap and trade system in Florida, versus his current opposition to the concept. Rubio responded:
I have never supported cap and trade and I never thought it was a good idea. And I was clear about that at the time. And I do not believe it’s a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment. And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy. When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
In another debate 4 months ago on CNN, Rubio made similar comments, adding:
America’s a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, but America is not a planet. And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore, China is, and they are drilling a hole anywhere in the world that they can get ahold of.
Fact checking Marco Rubio
Politifact ruled it “mostly true” that Rubio never supported cap and trade. However, the rest of his comments are mostly false.
First, “blame China” is no longer a viable option. Despite having much lower cumulative historical carbon emissions than the USA, China has agreed to take serious action to curb its coal consumption and carbon pollution, and has announced that it will launch the world’s largest carbon cap and trade system. Using China to oppose an American carbon cap and trade system simply doesn’t make sense.
Second, the “our pollution is too small to matter” argument is known as the Tragedy of the Commons fallacy. If the USA can make that argument, then so can every country. If every country uses this excuse, then none cut their carbon pollution, and climate destabilization becomes inevitable. The good news is that the opposite is already happening. Virtually every country in the world agreed to cut carbon pollution as a result of the Paris climate negotiations, including the United States and China.
Third, there are already cap and trade systems in place in the United States. The George H.W. Bush administration invented the concept of cap and trade to tackle the problem of acid rain with an economically optimal, free market approach. Under that cap and trade system, emissions of the pollutants that were causing acid rain were cut more quickly and cheaply than expected, and the estimated economic benefits have outweighed the costs of the system 40-to-1.
California and a collaboration of nine northeastern states also already have successful carbon cap and trade systems in place. In order to comply with proposed EPA carbon regulations, many more states are likely to implement carbon cap and trade systems, or join these existing networks.
Fourth, as these successful existing cap and trade systems demonstrate, the concept hasn’t been devastating for the economy. Quite the opposite – the economies of the nine northeastern states, which implemented their regional cap and trade system in 2008, and of California, where it was introduced in 2013, have fared better than the national average. There is also a consensus among economic experts that we should cut carbon pollution, with most favoring a cap and trade system or carbon tax.
In fact, in a March 2007 speech, Rubio wisely argued that Florida should take advantage of the economic opportunities created by this type of free market solution.
This nation, and ultimately the world, is headed towards emission caps and energy diversification. Those changes will require technological advances that make those measures cost effective. The demand toward such advances will create an industry to meet it—Florida should become the Silicon Valley of that industry.

Unfortunately there was no more debate about optimal climate policies last Thursday. Rubio rejected the possibility of a carbon cap and trade system, and the moderators moved on to another topic. However, the other Republican presidential candidates would likely have answered in a similar fashion. Governor Chris Christie pulled New Jersey out of the northeastern states carbon cap and trade system, Ted Cruz denies that the Earth is even warming, many of the candidates are science deniers, and the only Republican candidates who think we should take action to curb global warming (Lindsey Graham and George Pataki) have dropped out of the race.
Ideology vs. Reality
Climate change has sadly turned into an ideological litmus test. Republican candidates fear that if they admit human-caused global warming is a problem that we need to solve, they won’t be able to win their party’s nomination. As Graham and Pataki’s candidacies showed, that may be true.
However, a growing number of Republican thought leaders and even a majority of Republican voters support a revenue-neutral carbon tax. The problem is that while they represent a majority of the party, the conservative right wing of the party that imposes ideological purity tests dominates the primary election voting. This may be a flaw in the American political system, since the Republican Party now stands alone as the only climate-denying major political party in the world, and a candidate who can pass the right wing ideological purity test is unlikely to win a nationwide general election.
It’s a problem that the Republican Party must solve, because we need them to participate in the climate policy debate. Their candidates’ current strategy of denying the consensus of climate science and economics experts just won’t cut it when the entire world is moving forward with efforts to solve the problem, taking advantage of the resulting economic opportunities that Rubio recognized eight years ago."

The British public is far more concerned about the threat posed by population growth than it is about climate change, according to a YouGov survey published late last week.
The survey, which questioned more than 18,000 people in 17 different countries, found that while climate change is seen as the third most concerning issue globally, people in Britain feel armed conflicts and population growth pose a greater threat.
The study asked people to consider the threat posed by nine different issues - including global terrorism, population growth, energy scarcity and climate change - and rank them in order of what they consider to be the most serious. It also asked participants to identify which issue they considered as the most serious threat.
By taking an average of these two measures - to include both the breadth and density of concern in order to create a “share of concern” index - the research reveals that those most concerned about climate change are people in Hong Kong, Denmark and Sweden, with a 20 per cent, 16.2 per cent, and a 16 per cent share of concern for the issue respectively.
In contrast, the UK, US and Saudi Arabia were the three least-concerned countries about the issue, scoring 10.8 per cent, 9.2 per cent and 5.7 per cent respectively. People in Britain expressed the highest concern of any country about global population growth, while those in Saudi Arabia felt most strongly about the threat of armed conflicts.
Overall, climate change achieved a 12.8 per cent share of concern, ranking behind only international terrorism and the threat of poverty as the most concerning issues globally."

Last week, Fox News moderators asked only one question relevant to climate change, about whether Florida senator Marco Rubio would support regulation to lower emissions. Rubio said he would not: “I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.”
On the trail, former Florida governor Jeb Bush interjected to say the free market would resolve climate change before government could.
“There’s someone in a garage somewhere,” he said, “parochially I hope it’s in Miami, that’s going to have a clue, to have an answer to this.”
Miami will settle for anyone doing something – so long as it’s before environmental changes driven by humans destroy the city’s economy. Late last week, Mayor Tomás Regalado joined 14 other south Florida mayors in signing an open letter to Rubio, asking him to give up his opposition to climate change action.
Republicans might as well deny climate change if they don't plan to address it | Suzanne Goldenberg Read more
The low-lying city and its nearby resorts and islands suffer near annual floods from rising sea levels, costing the city hundreds of millions. The mayors warned that a 1ft increase in sea level could “wipe out as much as $4bn” in real estate, and 3ft could cost $31bn and swallow large sections of the Florida Keys and greater Miami area.
“We need a realistic national plan to slow global warming emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change,” the mayors wrote. “The science is well established: protecting the long-term future of our cities must include preventing global temperatures from rising.”
One of the signatories, South Miami mayor Philip Stoddard, was more blunt a few years before Rubio’s presidential bid.
Rubio is an idiot. He says he is not a scientist so he doesn’t have a view about climate change and sea-level rise Philip Stoddard, mayor of South Miami, speaking in 2014
“Rubio is an idiot,” he told the Guardian at the time. “He says he is not a scientist so he doesn’t have a view about climate change and sea-level rise and so won’t do anything about it.”
Rubio’s professed ignorance has shifted to skepticism – a sign that many Republicans have reluctantly accepted that the issue exists for voters, if not that the issue matters. Last year, Rubio and two of his rivals, senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, agreed in a symbolic vote that climate change is “is real and not a hoax”. Of the three, only Paul voted to agree that human activity causes global warming.
None have agreed that climate change exacerbates threats to national security and the economy, although the point is agreed on by Pentagon officials, Nasa scientists, foreign policy experts, dozens of Republican and Democratic leaders, international researchers and the pope.
The candidates might be playing simple politics – no one wants to be seen agreeing with Barack Obama or Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, who called climate denial a “charade” on Sunday night – but they have also tried out several arguments to discredit the dangers and science of climate change.

Ted Cruz fact check: which temperature data are the best? | Dana Nuccitelli Read more
That not all data indicates constant warming is one of the preferred arguments of Ted Cruz, who held a Senate hearing last month titled Data or Dogma.
To testify, Cruz called a retired Princeton physicist who believes the planet needs more carbon dioxide; a controversial climate scientist convinced of corruption in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); a climate scientist who insists basic models need reinvention; and a Canadian jazz vocalist who frequents the Rush Limbaugh Show and recorded an album about cats.
With the help of his witnesses and RSS satellite data since 1998, Cruz argued: “There has been no significant global warming for the past 18 years.”
But the senator chose a very specific set of data: an extraordinary El Niño set record temperatures in 1998, and by the RSS metric global warming has slowed in the 18 years since. The result was a chart that began with a peak and spanned not quite two decades of slow warming.
Carl Mears, the senior research scientist whose data Cruz used, told the Guardian that Cruz was guilty of the crime with which he charges scientists: presenting a very partial argument.
“He ignores other time periods, and other types of data,” said Mears, stressing surface temperatures “that do not support his hypothesis. He asserts that the satellite temperatures are more accurate than the surface temperature without providing any supporting evidence.”
Despite his own work with satellite data sets, Mears said he suspects surface data sets are more accurate.
“I agree with Mr Cruz that policy should follow science and data,” he said. “But it is important to follow all the data, not just the part that supports one side of the argument.”
A partial picture
Rubio has also spoken of the “hiatus”, which Mears and others are studying and which remains only part of the picture. Last year was the hottest on record by far, smashing a record set only a year earlier.
A witness called by Democrats to Cruz’s Senate hearing, David Titley, a Penn State meteorologist and former navy admiral, rebuffed Cruz. Titley noted that science by definition contains error and revision – demonstrated, for instance, by the corrections made to satellite data produced by his fellow witnesses.
He also showed a clear curve of rising temperatures and carbon dioxide levels since 1880.
“There are plenty of other signs that are far less equivocal, and perhaps even more relevant to those of us who live on the Earth’s surface,” he said. “Land and ocean surface temperatures are increasing, sea ice is declining, glaciers are shrinking, oceans are rising, the list goes on.”
Cruz mentioned a ship that got stuck in ice around Antarctica, arguing that the polar ice caps are not melting.
Charles Bentley, an expert on Antarctica at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told the Guardian that sea ice floats.
“If someone says sea ice in the same sentence as related to sea level change, a red flag goes up.”
Bentley called the argument “a little bit misleading”, because sea ice, although an indirect sign of change around the poles, “doesn’t directly indicate anything”. Cruz’s argument also ignores the clear melting of ice and glaciers on and around the north pole, where Russia, Canada and the US are competing over newly open ocean.
‘Destroying the economy’

Rubio and Cruz have both said they would pull the US out of the historic Paris climate accords, and with Bush and New Jersey governor Chris Christie said they oppose any measures that would “destroy” the economy or stifle business. Donald Trump, Bush and John Kasich have mocked the Paris summit as an unnecessary diversion.
If the US withdrew from the Paris deal, it would join North Korea, Syria, Libya and Venezuela among the handful of nations who refuse to sign.
The aversion to all regulation is a major departure from the policies of Republicans past. Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency, Ronald Reagan’s staff invented the cap and trade system, George HW Bush signed the Clean Air Act and Teddy Roosevelt protected 230m acres of land.
But the candidates have largely agreed with Rubio, who in a debate said: “We are not going to destroy our economy, make America a harder place to create jobs, in order to pursue a policy that will do nothing, nothing to change our climate.”
How climate change action might affect the economy depends on the measures involved; most of those proposed affect the worst emissions producers, such as coal – an industry in decline in the US for decades.
In 2014, about 67% of electricity generated in the US was from fossil fuels, according to the EIA, though oil only accounted for 1%. The US natural gas industry faces more pressure from cheap Opec oil than investment in renewable energy.
But in 2011, before the industry was rocked by low oil prices, the five main fossil fuel industries still accounted for less than 2% of all US non-agricultural employment.
Doing nothing also has its consequences, as south Florida businesses have tried to remind Republicans. By exacerbating flooding, water and energy crises and mass migration, climate change threatens to devastate the world economy – US gas industry included – according to a survey of 750 economists, conducted last year.
Economists at Stanford and UC Berkeley also published a study last year that found rising temperatures will likely exacerbate inequality."

All appointed board members of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency have had their terms expire and have not been replaced, leaving it governed by the secretary of the Department of the Environment, Guardian Australia has learned.
Australia's carbon emissions are increasing, government report shows Read more
The same thing happened in 2014 while Tony Abbott was prime minister, and the move has now been criticised as an attempt by the Turnbull government to remove the independence of the agency.
According to legislation, the board must consist of the secretary of the Department of the Environment and up to six others appointed by the minister. The agency can operate with the secretary being the only board member, since it reaches quorum when a majority of the board members are present, which now occurs with one.
Parliament sits for the first time in 2016 on Tuesday, with bills abolishing both the renewable energy agency (Arena) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation still before parliament, despite having been rejected by the Senate. Signs indicate the Turnbull government intends to keep them.
Arena is tasked with investing in emerging renewable energy technologies, while the CEFC invests in commercially viable renewable energy technologies. Disruption in the government’s handling of renewables has been blamed for a huge drop in clean energy investment in Australia.
If Arena is not abolished before July, it is set to receive almost $57m from the commonwealth and then almost $500m the following year.
The agency would not answer any questions about the matter and instead referred Guardian Australia to the Australian government boards website, which shows all positions are vacant.
The last three directors had their terms expire on 16 January.

“Everyone has been assuming with the change of leader, and a Senate that wouldn’t repeal it, that they were going to hang on to Arena,” said Tom Swann from the Australia Institute. “So given that, it’s pretty strange that they’ve let the board lapse and it raises questions about the future of Arena.”
The Greens environment spokeswoman, Larissa Waters, told Guardian Australia the move was an attempt to remove the agency’s independence. “The Senate won’t let the Liberals destroy this innovative, job-creating organisation, and so the Liberals are arrogantly trying to cut off its independence and expertise,” she said.
“Major proposals come to Arena’s board for decision and having only a time-poor department secretary on the board is bad due diligence and a wasted opportunity for injecting high-level, diverse expertise,” Waters said.
Swann said the agency’s empty board and the bills abolishing it and the CEFC still being before parliament continue to discourage the renewable energy industry. “Given that we’ve had such a huge drop-off of renewable energy [investment] in Australia, the last thing we need is confusing signals,” he said.
The chief executive of the Solar Council, John Grimes agreed the bills were bad for his industry and called on the government to remove them. “If Malcolm Turnbull doesn’t act on this then people will start to think he’s just another Tony Abbott,” Grimes said.
Waters said the bills were unlikely to be debated by parliament, but were being kept to keep peace within the Liberal party. “It’s duplicitous for the prime minister to talk up innovation, economic diversification and the achievements of Arena and CEFC, while keeping both of these cutting-edge agencies on the chopping block, presumably to placate climate-sceptic colleagues and donors,” she said.
“Given the Senate’s opposition to passing either abolition bill, listing them for debate sends an unnecessary and damaging investment message to the clean energy sector,” Waters said.

Labor environment spokesperson, Mark Butler told Guardian Australia: “The fact that Arena and the CEFC are still on the chopping block shows that the Liberals’ attacks on renewables hasn’t stopped under Malcolm Turnbull. Greg Hunt has confirmed that these two agencies will remain in the Turnbull Liberal government’s sites.”
A spokesman for the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said the government’s policy was still to abolish the two bodies, but said “there is little prospect of support in the Senate”. He said the new Office of Climate Change and Renewables Innovation, which was being established inside the Department of the Environment, “will bring a fresh focus to the role of innovation in supporting emerging renewable and low emissions technologies that will drive down emissions”."

Meryl Streep’s daughter Mamie Gummer is to star in Amazon Prime’s new fashion drama The Collection.
Created by Desperate Housewives and Ugly Betty showrunner Oliver Goldstick, The Collection is set in a Parisian fashion house just after the end of the second world war.
Centred around the two brothers who run the family business it also stars The Lady In the Van and Harry Potter actor Frances de la Tour, who plays scheming matriarch Yvette Sabine.
The brothers Paul and Claude are played, respectively, by Crossbones actor Richard Coyle and Tom Riley, whose previous credits include Da Vinci’s Demons and Monroe.
Gummer, who is probably best known to viewers for playing Nancy Crozier in hit US series The Good Wife, takes on the role of Paul’s wife Helen in The Collection, while Jenna Thiam, who was in French drama The Returned, also features as the face of the fashion house’s label.
Also appearing in the series are Mistresses star Sarah Parish and Foyle’s War actor Michael Kitchen.
Goldstick described The Collection as “an entrepreneurial fable set at a pivotal moment in France’s history when fashion truly became a vehicle for transformation and reinvention.
“At its heart, it is the story of a volatile family who pay a steep price for their ambition – and this “family” encompasses not only the name on the label, but the devoted workers who execute the master’s vision. Postwar Paris was a chaotic era of stark contrasts – hope and romance was in the air, but the shadow of the Occupation and its moral recriminations also haunted the city. In this divisive world, mystery and secrets abound; knowing too much can cost you a lot - even your life.”
The Collection is being made by Lookout Point, which co-produced BBC1’s acclaimed War and Peace and also makes Ripper Street for Amazon.
Chief executive Simon Vaughan said: “It’s very liberating that as an industry we can tell stories from literally anywhere now. War and Peace was 1812 Russia and now we are heading to postwar Paris, creating a global drama full of political and historical French context, yet shot in English with a truly magnificent ensemble from the UK, US and France.
“This is a far-reaching story, and the allure of Paris in 1948 with the sumptuous design and detail we are able to bring to that world, both front of house and in the workrooms, has proven to be a wonderfully alluring proposition for cast and crew and something we have never quite seen before on TV.”
Coyle said of his part: “Paul Sabine is a multi-layered and conflicted ‎character, with a dark secret in his past which threatens to destroy the fashion empire he is building. He is a puppet-master on the brink of superstardom, trying to implement his bold new vision while keeping the doors closed on the skeletons threatening to burst out.”
Filming has begun in Paris and Wales and the show will be available to Amazon Prime viewers in the UK later this year."
Australian media|Journalism education|Australian politics|comment,2016-02-01T03:58:33,guardian,Katharine Murphy,Guardian Australia’s deputy political editor Katharine Murphy looks back at the lessons of her 20 years in the Canberra press gallery,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/01/how-to-be-a-political-reporter-know-your-beat-respect-the-reader-hold-your-nerve,"How to be a political reporter: know your beat, respect the reader, hold your nerve",en,UK|media,,"“Then and now” is always a trap, and a fiendish one in these challenging days when Australian journalism is buffeted by profound structural change. Nostalgia dictates that things were always so much better in the olden days when we had certainty.
It’s all right – you can relax. I have no intention of boring you senseless with syrupy sentiment. I’m confident I missed journalism’s golden age – if there was in fact a golden age. But I do want to start with a personal counterpoint because it helps me sift through how things have changed in the 20 years I’ve been hacking away in the parliamentary press gallery in Canberra.
In January 1996 I showed up at the Senate entrance of Parliament House waiting to be signed in by my new colleagues at the Australian Financial Review. I was then in my mid 20s. I’d had an accidental first career thrust upon me by the recession in the early 1990s – I’d been a public servant since my exit from university because I’d been lucky enough to have been taken on as a graduate administrative assistant at a time when it was very hard to get a job.
Between 1992 and 1996 (with a year off wandering the world) I worked in three government departments – industrial relations, the environment, and communications and the arts. As a consequence, I knew about policy – how proposals tracked up through departments and over to Parliament House and back again. I’d been a very junior sausage maker, attached to some very experienced and connected bosses. And as a consequence of the sort of work I did, I knew ministerial staff, a number of bureaucrats and some press gallery folks. That was my value to the AFR: knowing something of the working of government from the inside.
These days, when young reporters wait full of anticipation at the Senate entrance for their colleagues to sign them in for their first day on the Canberra beat, they have been selected for different reasons. Knowing something of the territory still matters, it’s still desirable, self-evidently – but proven capacity in the rigours of the 24/7 news cycle and digital fluency probably matter more, at least in the mainstream press.
My next 10 years brought constant transition, which has completely revolutionised the way I do things
The AFR might still hire the odd person like me but I suspect I’d struggle to get in the door anywhere else. I was a lateral hire, a risk. I knew what I knew but I needed to be taught on the job how to be a journalist. Canberra political reporting is one of the most competitive and relentless environments in Australia journalism. The cycle never sleeps. These days we are too busy for risks, or for intense on-the-job incubation.
When I walked in to the parliamentary press gallery in January 1996 I walked into a corridor populated by big newspaper bureaus and big television and radio bureaus.
There was bustle but it was an orderly sort of business. We worked hard, or we thought we did. Down the newspaper end of the corridor we filed several stories a day in a great rush in the evening. Our job was not to record the moment, it was to throw forward. We were concerned with tomorrow’s news, not today’s. We were print, and proudly so. Writers.
There was no rolling news cycle, apart from the wire services and the hardworking radio journalists, who filed every hour. We weren’t podcasters, bloggers, photographers, television talking heads, live radio talent, tweeters, Facebookers, Instagramers, Periscopers.
At least we weren’t until the great disruption. By the great disruption I mean, of course, the arrival of the internet. Digital, when it arrived, smashed all the old, long-cherished demarcations. The era of specialisation was behind us.
Nobody asked us whether or not we wanted this to happen. It just happened, and we had to adjust. Some of us didn’t get the chance to adjust – successive redundancy rounds loomed grimly alongside our brave new world.
So, I had 10 years of being just one thing.
My next 10 years in political journalism brought constant transition, which has completely revolutionised the way I do things.
While the “what” and the “how” of what I do is a world away from the comparative calm of 1996, the journalistic mission has remained constant and the values underpinning my practice have become more important than ever.
In this essay, I’d like to share some of the changes of this period and consider their impact on my journalism.
Don't lament the comments thread – sharp audience feedback is fine with me Read more
Active readers and established beats
The most significant change over my decade in transition has been the rise of the reader. At the start of my career I was a print journalist. I wrote for a newspaper. Readers were important but distant. They were on the letters page. There was my dentist, who took great delight in informing his receptionist this woman who was about to be liberated from her wisdom teeth “worked at the Financial Review”. There was the odd person at a party. There were the regular letter writers, often elderly, sometimes abusive.
I’m no longer a print journalist. Technology has pushed me into another professional form – a digital form. That same technology has brought readers much closer.
They talk to me, and each other, at length in the comments thread under the live blog I write when federal parliament sits. They are in my inbox 24/7, with tips, bouquets and brickbats. They want to follow me in Instagram and Facebook, and they talk to me on Twitter. They give me instant feedback when I’m on Insiders on the ABC, or on the radio, or Sky News. The reader is now right beside me, because technology connects us all, and makes everyone a micro-publisher.
The US journalism academic Jay Rosen calls modern news consumers “the people formerly known as the audience” – he likens them to passengers on a ship who have decamped to build a boat of their own.
“The people formerly known as the audience wish to inform media people of our existence, and of a shift in power that goes with the platform shift you’ve all heard about,” Rosen says. “Think of passengers on your ship who got a boat of their own. The writing readers. The viewers who picked up a camera. The formerly atomised listeners who with modest effort can connect with each other and gain the means to speak— to the world, as it were.”
Katharine Viner, launch editor of Guardian Australia, and now the editor-in-chief of our global operation, explains the change thus.
“Digital is not about putting up your story on the web. It’s about a fundamental redrawing of journalists’ relationship with our audience, how we think about our readers, our perception of our role in society, our status. We are no longer the all-seeing all-knowing journalists, delivering words from on high for readers to take in, passively, save perhaps an occasional letter to the editor. Digital has wrecked those hierarchies almost overnight, creating a more levelled world, where responses can be instant, where some readers will almost certainly know more about a particular subject than the journalist.”
To people outside contemporary journalism, noting this change might seem a simple cultural curiosity. But as Viner and Rosen correctly assert, operationally, this is a major structural shift.
Once journalists could get away with “voice of God” journalism – preaching to an audience with confected certainties. It was a fiction so absurd it could only sustained in an era when the readers didn’t actually talk back.
The rise of the reader: journalism in the age of the open web | Katharine Viner Read more
Once readers gained equality with the folks paid to put down the first draft of history, once they gained the option to micro-publish and share their interventions, the jig was well and truly up. Our tone had to shift. Journalists, readers and viewers will be delighted to know, have had humility thrust upon us. Not all of us, mind you. But some of us, certainly.
From my own perspective the rise of the reader is a welcome development. At its best, the new environment is more democratic, more vibrant, more interesting, more stimulating and more honest, both for the journalist and for the reader.
I’ve pushed the engagement philosophy in my own practice. I make it a priority to speak to readers “below the line” – in the comments threads under my live politics blog or my Dispatches column. I also engage with readers on social media.
I think all contemporary journalists should approach readers as equal participants in the national discourse.
Not just say that. Mean it.
But the equality philosophy presents working journalists with an interesting conundrum. If we are no longer asserting our privileged status, can we still assert the value of our specialist knowledge?
I believe we can.
A news organisation paid me for years on end to cover the same approximate beat David Simon, creator of The Wire
And the reason we can is because Canberra remains an important bedrock of “beat” journalism. In my view, the journalistic beat is the heart of who we are and what we do. Technology may have transformed print and broadcast specialists into harried multi-taskers, but technology hasn’t changed the mission. The journalistic mission remains at its simplest: know your patch and use your knowledge to try to tell readers what’s actually going on.
As the former Baltimore Sun journalist David Simon – creator of TV shows including The Wire and Treme – says on the subject of beat journalism: “The reason I am able to tell you this story is not because I am now an amateur or because I have a blog. It is, above all, because a news organisation paid me for years on end to cover the same approximate beat on a full-time basis. I did it for 50 or 60 hours a week because the Baltimore Sun had a sufficient revenue stream to pay me a living wage and benefits so that I could take a mortgage and raise a family and show up to do the work on a daily basis.”
As the industry contracts, it is beat journalism that finds itself most under threat. It is hard to maintain a rounds structure or a beat structure when the newsroom is shrinking and there are more platforms to service in any given 24 hours. As a devotee of the beat, I have a rakish pride in Canberra’s capacity to roll on relentlessly in flagrant opposition to an industry trend which, on my analysis, is our most troubling form of iterative extinction.
By rolling on I mean this: we show up. We get to know the protagonists. We watch the cycles of politics, long enough to see them repeat. We outlast the various ministerial staff and often the ministers who periodically vow to extract terrible career-ending revenge because something undesirable has been written. As one of the press gallery’s leading lights, Laura Tingle, noted to the then social services minister Scott Morrison at a National Press Club event in February 2015: “I plan to be here long after I’ve seen you off.” Morrison’s response to that light-hearted provocation? “Wonderful.” Tingle’s response to that: “I thought you’d be pleased.”
We do acquire expert, detailed, valuable knowledge. Our staying power fills our brains with context which informs all kinds of judgments. But to continue to say that, we need to be worthy of trust.
Trust requires honesty. It requires some collective self-knowledge. It requires the capacity to be humble before an audience, which is a trait journalists are always reluctant to show. Journalists are supposed to be crusaders and people who trade on our knowledge. We project as authoritative. We are not supposed to admit both ourselves and our processes are, periodically, flawed.
Here’s my personal contribution to the collective humility requirement. We political journalists don’t always get things right. We sometimes produce race call commentary and gotcha rubbish that isn’t worth the reader’s time. We can lapse into herd instincts. Some of us are capable of abuses of power. We can also be captured by the protagonists, which might work for them, but doesn’t work for the reader.
As a journalist who goes looking for audience feedback, I hear rather a lot of it
For a political journalist, remaining independent is a conscious choice. You have to want to be independent, even if it means you are off the Christmas card list, or the prime minister’s office “accidentally on purpose” forgets to brief you when they’ve briefed 10 other colleagues. You can miss stories when you refuse to act as someone’s drop box. Missing stories is generally frowned upon by the bosses in our line of work, so politicians and their operatives use the baseline anxiety to try to herd cats, or they use information in calculated ways – briefing a person they want to advance, blocking a person they don’t approve of.
It’s quite funny at one level, the pettiness of it. Sometimes the kindergarten tactics work, sometimes they don’t. Asserting independence requires a certain clarity of mission: “I write for readers, I don’t write to amplify your agenda, or to impress someone.”
As a journalist who goes looking for audience feedback, I hear rather a lot of it. I hear how deficient I am, or how deficient the parliamentary press gallery is; I hear how the gallery makes things up; how various journalists are undeclared cyphers for various politicians. Readers observe I’m an idiot for writing that Tony Abbott is intelligent, or allege that I have a corrosive bias against Bill Shorten.
Pushing out to readers rather than standing back, convinced you know better, is a bit like being a surgeon performing a delicate operation while a small crowd gathers to tell you how you should be cutting, or stitching, or clamping.
As I’ve already noted, some of the criticism about gallery reporting is entirely justified. But I do periodically consume criticism of the press gallery that is about as shallow and uninformed as the worst of our work.
The gallery is regularly said to be monolithic. We are not. My corridor in 2015 is populated by a diverse group of journalists working at different levels with different personal aspirations. Some of us work for good bosses who prize the integrity of the work above all else. Some of us don’t.
Some of the shallow critiques readily traverse the what but never pause to ask why.
The fact is we are working in challenging conditions: the most challenging conditions I have yet inhabited. The rolling news cycle creates conditions in which small things can gain disproportionate coverage (more of this shortly.)
This is a broad generalisation, but it think it holds – we’ve gone from the placid news cycle I started in, which served to amplify the messages of politicians in largely orderly and linear fashion – to a cycle of constant cross-current, contention and disruption. It can be hard to keep your feet, your nerve and your clarity in such conditions.
Audiences want their news now. They don’t want to wait for us to think for several more hours
To summarise the arguments: Canberra is a journalistic beat and mastery of the beat remains the essence of daily journalism. But to continue to assert that right, we need to be accurate, we need to be trustworthy and we need to listen to voices and perspectives other than our own.
Listen. Yes, really.
Capturing the reader’s trust is central to our mission. In my view, it’s the most important thing we now do, and they way we do it is by reaching out, explaining and building community. There are no shortcuts.
The importance of the audience and the lure of the ‘new’
The rise of the internet and the proximity of the audience has increased the intensity of everything in our professional world. We have entered a fully connected life, which both enriches and punishes its inhabitants.
Audiences want their news now. They don’t want to wait for us to think for several more hours before bringing them up to speed, they want it in real time.
Our analytical audience measurement tools tell us with brutal precision what audiences are reading, how long they read it for, how much they’ve shared it.
Keeping engaged audiences engaged has become an existential challenge for daily commercial media journalism. With readers we can generate revenue, and live. If they desert us, we die.
I’ve already indicated that the digital news cycle requires a completely different approach than print. Our working day begins much earlier and often wraps late. We don’t just write anymore, we talk on video, we podcast, we blog, we live stream, we meme.
We have had to will our minds to work faster, to not only chase new facts but to provide clarity and context in the moment, because that’s the expectation of the audience.
The rolling news cycle is a hungry beast and its fuel is the “new”.
The print cycle of two decades ago imposed a simple discipline. “New” wasn’t enough to make the cut. The development had to be both new and important.
If it was new and important it would appear on page one or page three or page five – still important 24 hours after it happened. The important made it to the top of the list, and the intra-day static fell away to three paragraphs at the bottom of the story, or to the cutting-room floor.
I’m not meaning to imply the old print cycle saved readers from inaccuracies or defamations or distortions or poor judgments – it didn’t, of course. But scarcity did impose a discipline that is fast becoming an anachronism. It is not uncommon to see a story running prominently on a news website that would not have made the paper 20 years ago – simply because it is new, not because we really need to know. Good news organisations still apply the old judgment matrix, a story must be both new and important to gain prominent display. But these values are not always applied universally.
From my perspective, the consequential professional response to the rise of the reader should be to deliver better, richer, more informed, more collaborative journalism because there are ample opportunities to do just that. Our collective ambition should not be to dish up breaking fluff with an over-egged headline in the desperate hope that audiences will fail to grasp the difference.
But this sort of integrity can be hard to assert. It requires editorial leaders to keep their heads and their feet in a maelstrom. It requires reporters to say no when they are asked to produce or chase material devoid of value and offer up smarter ways of coming at the content.
In short, prioritising quality over disposability requires experience, guts, and a steady hand, and it requires the professional will to make the internet serve the journalistic mission rather than allowing the thready impulses of the web or the bandwagon culture of social media to enslave the journalism.

It is very easy for breaking canapes, or breaking gossip, or breaking half facts to shoot to the top of Google news alerts, or start trending on social media, which generates entirely rational pressure for news websites to jump on board and chase those clicks.
Some thoughts for young journalists
I want to end this essay by looping back to the beginning. I entered political journalism in my mid 20s as a lateral hire. As I noted in the opening, I’m entirely confident I would not get a job now.
In 1996 I walked into a fully staffed Canberra bureau where senior correspondents had time to mentor my transition from public servant to journalist. I owe my career to a handful of people who worked intensively with me to make sure I made that transition successfully. Now senior correspondents in Canberra, and news editors, have less time. There is no less will, no less professional generosity, but there is less time. Bureaus are smaller than they were a decade ago and the demands on their denizens are exponentially greater.
The best thing that​ happened to me as a reporter was being encouraged by my mentors to listen and watch and learn
Now there’s a tendency to bring in recruits with a proven track record in metropolitan newsrooms, and there’s an expectation that everyone will do a bit of everything, not specialise in a particular journalistic skill set.
Part of what employers are looking for is energy and acumen: surviving the rigours of Canberra’s highly competitive breaking news culture requires a significant capacity for hard work, and it requires having the skills and networks to promote your work.
Getting the work out there is now a collective exercise, not a contribution made externally to news organisation by newsagents and other distributors. Dealing your work into the digital conversation is an important requirement of contemporary journalism.
Young reporters seeking to come to Canberra for a long time or for a short time are walking into a more chaotic and demanding and uncertain and contested professional world than the one I entered. But it is a richer ecosystem in almost every respect.
It’s a more diverse world. The digital revolution has opened the field for new players. The young reporters formerly known as print journalists don’t now just have to wonder whether they will work for News Corporation or for Fairfax Media. They can now also contemplate working for Guardian Australia, or Crikey, or BuzzFeed, or Junkee, or for the Huffington Post, or for the online sites of the ABC and SBS. The offering is more vibrant than it was a decade ago – and that’s before we get to the blogs and specialist publications – but of course it’s no utopia. Well-paid, secure jobs are hard to find and the future of commercial media remains uncertain.
News organisations have distinct editorial voices, and presentational styles, meaning there’s no one size fits all. The nascent diversity means young reporters need to have digital skills, social media fluency, and a flexible attitude – and I think reporters who understand and embrace a reader-centred philosophy will put themselves philosophically where they need to be in order to prosper in their chosen vocation.
Hack to the future: will a journalism degree help your job prospects? Read more
While young reporters need new skills, the advice I got from my mentors 20 years ago remains constant. Get your facts straight, and if you don’t have your facts straight, don’t rush to publish them.
The digital world can sanction the corrosive “never wrong for long” philosophy but while the technology allows rapid resetting in the event of error, adopt a blase attitude at your peril. If contemporary journalism demands that reporters cultivate their personal brand, and enter a contract with active readers where trust is central to the sharing and the conversation, then accuracy is actually more important now than it has ever been.
I do a great deal of live work at Guardian Australia, which exposes me to the constant risk of error, overstatement and cock-up. I’m periodically guilty of all of these sins. But I’m also clear in my approach. Having presided over a live blog for several years, I’d rather be running just behind the action with reliable content than just ahead of the action with speculative or unreliable content.
Older reporters always have a tendency to say this to younger reporters but it’s right in the main. The second piece of advice apart from get it right is watch and learn before you give the readers the benefit of your wisdom.
The cycle is hungry for content, and for opinion, the more outrageous the better. The best thing that happened to me as a reporter was being encouraged by my mentors to listen and watch and learn and serve a careful apprenticeship before I wandered into analytical territory. The views I would have been delighted to express to anyone who would listen during my first 10 years on the job would really not have been worth listening to, so I’m very glad I didn’t have the opportunity to share them.
Political reporting today requires tenacity, at times it requires courage, it requires nuance – a vastly under-rated attribute in our “shouty” world. It requires the capacity to keep your feet, both with the new material that thrusts itself to you 24/7, and with the political class who are always intent on cajoling, hectoring or otherwise persuading you to accept the rightness and inherent virtue of their various propositions.
It requires a deep scepticism, which should never be confused with a deep cynicism. As Oscar Wilde once observed, a cynic is someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.
My vocation requires you to play a long game, even if you only inhabit the hothouse for a short time.
But what it requires now, 20 years ago, 20 years from now, is truth seekers.
It doesn’t matter what platform we produce on, whether the demands are many or few, whether there is certainty, the illusion of certainty, or no certainty at all – the vocation is constant.
It requires a deep-seated desire to serve the public by speaking truth to power.

Terry Wogan|Television|BBC|news,2016-02-01T07:22:20,guardian,John Plunkett,"Famously outspoken, he was knighted after dominating TV and radio for 50 years, and even became an unlikely pop star",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/31/terry-wogan-son-of-an-irish-grocer-legendary-broadcaster,Terry Wogan's rise to fame: Irish grocer's son to legendary broadcaster,en,UK|media,,"Famously outspoken, he was knighted after dominating TV and radio for decades, and even became an unlikely pop star
The son of an Irish grocery shop manager, Terry Wogan began his career in banking before securing a job as a newsreader and announcer with Irish broadcaster Radio Éireann (RTE). Wogan worked on news and documentaries with RTE, with a brief stint as a radio DJ, before moving to Britain.
At 29, Wogan became one of the presenters in the original lineup of BBC Radio 1 when it launched in 1967. Other DJs included breakfast host Tony Blackburn and John Peel.
He first presented the BBC Radio 2 breakfast show in 1972 after deputising for Jimmy Young and presenting his own daily show on both Radio 1 and Radio 2. He left in 1984 to host a thrice-weekly chat show on BBC1, called simply Wogan. He returned to Radio 2 for a second stint on the breakfast show in 1993, and would remain for another 16 years.
‘Numbing of the prefrontal lobes’
Wogan covered the Eurovision Song Contest for BBC radio for the first time in 1971 and began his TV coverage of the event in 1973. He went on to cover the contest for UK and Irish audiences for more than three decades. “All I’ve gained by watching the Eurovision Song Contest over the years is a numbing of the prefrontal lobes,” Wogan once said. “Ten seconds after the contest has finished, I’ve forgotten every song … The whole thing has become an astounding, huge, grandiose load of rubbish.
One of the founders of the BBC’s Children in Need, Wogan began presenting the annual charity appeal in 1978, when it began as a five-minute broadcast on Christmas Day. It became a live evening of programmes in 1980 and Wogan hosted the event until 2014. He faced criticism in 2007 after it was revealed he was paid a fee for the show, which he later waived.
Unlikely pop star
Wogan’s version of The Floral Dance was a top 30 hit in 1978. A follow-up single, Me and the Elephant, was less memorable, and he remains better known for playing records than making them. He returned to the recording studio to make cover versions of Silver Bells and Little Drummer Boy/Peace on Earth, with Aled Jones, for Children in Need.
Wogan presented BBC1 TV quiz show Blankety Blank for four years until 1983. It was famous for its bargain-basement prizes – including the infamous consolation prize, the Blankety Blank chequebook and pen – and Wogan’s wand-like microphone that panellist Kenny Everett regularly tried to break in half. Wogan was succeeded as host by Les Dawson and, later, Paul O’Grady.
The most infamous episode of his BBC1 talkshow was the appearance by a drunken George Best in 1990. “I could see him coming at me from across the stage, the eyes were glazed and I knew the worst had happened,” Wogan recalled. “He’d shunted down several bucketfuls in about five minutes. He was drunk as a skunk.” Other memorable appearances came courtesy of Anne Bancroft and David Icke.
Honorary knighthood
Plain old Terry Wogan became Sir Terry in 2005 when he was given an honorary knighthood. He joined a select group, including Bob Geldof and Bill Gates, to receive the honour, usually only bestowed on British and Commonwealth citizens. If followed an honorary OBE in 1997.
With nearly 8 million listeners, Wogan had long been the most popular breakfast show in the country. He once described Radio 1’s Chris Moyles, who has the second most popular breakfast show, as “in doubtful taste”. Moyles responded by saying he would “tear that wig off his head and shove it up his arse”.
Not everything Wogan touched turned to broadcasting gold. His short-lived Channel Five talkshow, The Terry and Gaby Show, which he presented with Gaby Roslin, was dropped in 2004 because of poor ratings. The show was made by a production company run by the man who replaced him on Radio 2, Chris Evans.
‘It’s Cyndi!’
His most inauspicious broadcasting moment was announcing the wrong winner at the end of BBC1’s Eurovision Song Contest heats in 2007. “It’s Cyndi!” announced Wogan. “It’s Scooch!” corrected his co-presenter, Fearne Cotton. If Wogan was upset, it was nothing compared with how Cyndi felt. The BBC’s director general, Mark Thompson, absolved Wogan of all blame.
As well as being one of the BBC’s biggest stars, Wogan was also one of its most outspoken. “When I started, people who worked for the BBC knew they weren’t earning as much as people in commercial television, but they did have the satisfaction of knowing that they worked for one of the finest, if not the finest, broadcasting organisation in the whole world,” he said in 2008. “I’m not sure they feel that any more, or at least that it means as much as it used to.”
Wogan’s sardonic commentary was invariably the best thing about Eurovision, on which he commentated for 35 years. But it was no laughing matter when he stepped down in 2008 after tiring of bloc voting and complaining it was “no longer a music contest”. He was replaced by Graham Norton. Wogan later described the musical jamboree as a “triumph of appalling taste” and said “everyone knows it’s rubbish”.
Countless hours of morning companionship
After 27 years – in two stints – on the BBC Radio 2 breakfast show, Wogan announced on air in September 2009 that he would be stepping down and that Chris Evans would succeed him. “I wanted to be the first to tell you,” he told listeners. “It’s the least I owe you, for endless years, countless hours of morning companionship, friendship, good humour, and laughter. Your loyalty and support has been a beacon of love in my life.”
Wogan returned to radio in February 2010 when he began hosting the Sunday morning Weekend Wogan show. The final broadcast of the show was in November 2015."

Appended to the article was the following statement:
As Poynter’s Benjamin Mullin pointed out, this certainly challenged “traditional notions of journalistic neutrality.”
Ryan Grim, HuffPo’s Washington bureau chief, told Poynter: “We will never stop reminding our audience who Trump is and what his campaign really represents.”
Although another HuffPo spokesman said the note would appear below all its articles about Trump, I can’t locate any other examples.
It was not published under stories such as “Trump’s Hollywood star is vandalised with a swastika”; “Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lead Iowa caucus poll”; and “A Democrat explains why she’s voting for Donald Trump”.
So perhaps there has since been a change of mind. HuffPo has done that before. In July 2015, it moved Trump coverage to its entertainment section, calling his campaign a “sideshow”, but it reversed that decision in December.
This time around, Grim defended the innovation by arguing that it was fair because “these are merely statements of fact.” Asked about the possible impact on readers, he said:
“We’re not telling them what to think, we’re telling them what we think... Being fully upfront and honest with readers is a mark of our respect for their ability to think freely and for themselves.”
HuffPo is hardly alone among US media in dealing with Trump in a very different fashion to its treatment of any other politician.
At the beginning of December, the Washington Post’s Dana Milbank wrote a commentary headlined “Donald Trump is a bigot and a racist”.
He noted: “There is a greater imperative not to be silent in the face of demagoguery. Trump in this campaign has gone after African Americans, immigrants, Latinos, Asians, women, Muslims and now the disabled.” And he went on to list Trump’s sins:
Trump led the ‘birther’ movement challenging President Obama’s standing as a natural-born American; used various vulgar expressions to refer to women; spoke of Mexico sending rapists and other criminals across the border; called for rounding up and deporting 11 million illegal immigrants; had high-profile spats with prominent Latino journalists and news outlets; mocked Asian accents; let stand a charge made in his presence that Obama is a Muslim and that Muslims are a ‘problem’ in America; embraced the notion of forcing Muslims to register in a database; falsely claimed thousands of Muslims celebrated the 9/11 attacks in New Jersey; tweeted bogus statistics asserting that most killings of whites are done by blacks; approved of the roughing up of a black demonstrator at one of his events; and publicly mocked the movements of New York Times (and former Washington Post) journalist Serge Kovaleski, who has a chronic condition limiting mobility.
Also in December, BuzzFeed’s editor-in-chief, Ben Smith, told his journalists they could call Trump a liar and “mendacious racist”.
In a memo to staff, Smith said of Tump: “He’s out there saying things that are false and running an overtly anti-Muslim campaign. BuzzFeed News’s reporting is rooted in facts, not opinion; these are facts.”
None of it appears to have dissuaded thousands of Americans from supporting Trump. Indeed, it may well convince people of the distance between them and the so-called “liberal media.”
They will view it as proof that media outlets, old and new, are unrepresentative of their opinions and attitudes.
It is a further example of the way in which the success of Trump’s presidential candidacy has revealed a deep political, social and cultural split in modern America.

BBC1’s The Voice UK continued its climb back on Saturday night from one of its worst starts in years, adding 300,000 viewers over last week to draw an audience of 6.9 million on Saturday.
The rise in ratings gave the show, which will move to ITV next year, a 32% share of all viewing, and took its ratings close to the 7.1 million who tuned into the debut on 9 January, which was one of the show’s worst opening nights for years.
Call the Midwife also scored a hit for BBC1 on Sunday, pulling in 7.6 million viewers and more than 30% of the total audience. The third episode of the fifth series was down slightly on last week and the almost 8 million who tuned in for the series opener, but was comfortably the most-watched drama show of the weekend, beaten only by Countryfile.
However, the gore and guts of the Napoleonic wars and a dose of full-frontal nudity failed to boost the channel’s War and Peace, with 5.1 million viewers tuning in on Sunday night, giving it just under 22% of the total audience.
More than 1 million viewers have stopped tuning in since the show’s premiere on the first weekend of the year.
It was just beaten by Vera, ITV’s detective series starring Brenda Blethyn, which brought in 5.4 million viewers once viewing on the ITV +1 channel was included.
The return of Channel 4’s celebrity reality series The Jump drew an average of 2.3 million viewers, down 500,000 from the 2015.
The winter sports reality show, which features celebrities including former Superman actor Dean Cain, Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding and Olympian Linford Christie, managed a 9.5% share of total TV viewing between 7.30pm and 9pm.
Viewing was well down on the 2015 series opener, which drew a healthy 2.8 million viewers, and the 2.6 million that tuned in for first series debut in 2014.
The Davina McCall-fronted show was up against tough competition from BBC1’s Call the Midwife and ITV’s Vera."

Samsung released an update on Sunday night that allows apps to stop ads appearing in its own web browser, which is installed as a default on its smartphones.
Samsung is the first major maker of smartphones running Google’s Android operating system to enable adblocking, following a similar announcement by iPhone maker Apple in September. Samsung accounted for 22% of all smartphones sold in 2015, according to Strategy Analytics, just ahead of Apple’s 16%.
Adblocking almost as popular on mobile devices as desktops Read more
The Korean firm’s decision to allow its customers to block ads will be a further headache for companies that make money from digital advertising, as most are seeing their audiences rapidly move to mobile devices.
Until Apple’s announcement, adblocking rates remained far lower on smartphones than desktops in most regions outside Asia. However, research published last week by GlobalWebIndex suggested that the number of people blocking ads on mobiles is rapidly approaching the same level.
Samsung’s decision is likely to have less impact than Apple’s because many users of its Android operating system use Google’s Chrome browser, which is automatically offered as a way to open links on the devices.
Google makes the vast majority of its revenue from advertising and is unlikely to be enthusiastic about adblocking. However, both it and other web firms such as Facebook have recognised growing concern among consumers about slow load speeds and increased data usage caused by ads, and have developed ways of delivering content such as news articles more quickly and in small file sizes."
Media|Greenslade|Scotland|Media law|Newspapers|Newsquest|Gannett|blogposts,2016-02-01T11:53:44,guardian,Roy Greenslade,Costs of legal action by football club might have led to newsroom job cuts,https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/feb/01/why-the-heralds-editor-fired-a-columnist-in-row-with-rangers,Why the Herald's editor fired a columnist in row with Rangers,en,UK|scotland,,"The row over the firing of a columnist at Glasgow’s Sunday Herald shows no signs of dying down.
Members of Scottish PEN, wrote a letter to the paper’s editor-in-chief, Magnus Llewellin, to register their concern about Angela Haggerty being dismissed.
The letter, published on the website of the group that campaigns for freedom of expression, said its members are “deeply troubled” by the newspaper’s decision to sack Haggerty “for showing her support for fellow journalist Graham Spiers.”
Spiers decided he couldn’t write for the Herald after disagreeing about the timing of its publication of an apology for one of his columns about the problems of bigotry “around” Rangers football club. Haggerty then expressed her support for him on Twitter.
The National Union of Journalists accused the Herald of “pandering to the mob”. It removed its statement for a while but later reinstated it.*
Like Scottish PEN’s admission that it was unaware of “details” about pressure exerted on the Herald by Rangers, the NUJ’s decision reflected a lack of knowledge about the incident.
My understanding is that a single sentence in Spiers’s column, an allegation about a Rangers board director, was regarded as defamatory.
Although contentious articles are usually read for possible libels prior to publication by the paper’s lawyers, Levy & McRae, an editorial staff error meant that Spiers’s column, which was published on the Herald’s website, slipped through the net.
Once Rangers objected, Llewellin found himself in a bind familiar to all journalists in such situations. He received legal advice saying the allegation was indefensible, and that if he tried to defend it - which he spent a fortnight initially trying to do - the paper would have faced major costs.
Crucially, I understand that the costs would most likely have been borne by the editorial budget and, in Llewellin’s view, could therefore have resulted in job cuts. (I’ll deal with this in a moment).
So Llewellin felt he had to publish the apology. It stated: “We acknowledge every member of the Rangers board is fully committed to fighting bigotry and offensive chanting, wherever it occurs in Scottish football, and that the club is actively tackling the issue.”
Its publication upset Spiers who responded with an online statement saying he wanted more time to clarify his position. He realised that his opposition to the apology would effectively cut his ties with the Herald.
He acknowledged that he could afford to be bold because he has other income, writing for the Times and through broadcasting for the BBC.
But Haggerty, a relatively new columnist with the Sunday Herald, was sympathetic to Spiers’s plight and, as someone who has previously suffered abuse from from Rangers fans after editing a book about the club, she wrote a tweet in which she complained about Rangers’ bigotry.
As I wrote previously, she maintains that she was referring to fans, but the Herald saw it differently and considered it to be a reference to Rangers’ directors. The paper therefore viewed it as a failure “to act within the spirit of its apology.”
Lewellin told me he regards Haggerty as “a brave and talented journalist” but her reference to “glaring bigotry at Ibrox” only hours “after we’d published a very carefully worded apology to avoid legal action, she (unwittingly) undermined it.”
In a Bella Caledonia piece about the circumstances of her sacking, Haggerty said Llewellin had informed her that “representatives of Rangers Football Club” had brought her tweets to the attention of the Herald, “and that, to cut a long story short, the paper was under so much legal pressure that he felt he had no option but to let me go.”
She wrote: “He also informed me that Neil MacKay, editor of the Sunday Herald, had fought strongly to stop it happening, but in the end he was overruled.” Mackay underlined that fact in a tweet saying it was not his decision to remove Haggerty.
I emailed Llewellin to ask if he would consider reinstating Haggerty but he replied that “as things stand at present, and to show the good faith and collective responsibility... bringing her back would be difficult - for the time being at least.”
At least that final phrase offers Haggerty a possible lifeline for the future, if she wishes to grab it.
Now let me go back to that matter of legal costs being borne by the editorial department. I am not doubting Llewellin’s word, but I am amazed that a publisher - in this case, Newsquest/Gannett - might expect an editor to sacrifice jobs over a legal action.
That casts the whole business of Llewellin’s decision-making in a new light.
*This sentence was amended after the NUJ reposted its statement"

And countless inside pages were devoted to the man who made millions of radio listeners smile every morning.
There were some predictable headlines, with the Sun and Daily Mirror both running “Thank you for being our friend”. Metro said “Thanks, Tel” and the Daily Express chose “Farewell, Sir Terry.”
But I rather think Wogan would have appreciated more the Daily Star’s imaginative “Top o’ the mourning”.
Many papers referred to Wogan being a national treasure and I guess that, being Irish, he could have achieved a unique double: a national treasure in two nations.
Among the many tributes from writers, three stood out. Mark Lawson, in the Guardian, picked up on Wogan being broadcasting’s equivalent of Flann O’Brien. Quite right too. His gentle, subversive satire had a surreal quality.
Allison Pearson, in the Telegraph, concentrated on his warmth and gift of the gab. A single quote from her piece was used on the paper’s front page: “If the Queen, who was among his devoted listeners, is the nation’s centre of gravity then Terry Wogan was its centre of levity.”
And in the Daily Mail, there was a wonderfully intimate piece by fellow countryman, John McEntee, who was Wogan’s friend for 40 years. It included some of his jokes and several anecdotes, none better than a remark about the rolling of his favourite Cuban cigars."

She may be a bestselling author and makeup mogul now, but Zoe “Zoella” Sugg is still attracting new fans on her original stomping ground: YouTube.
The vlogger’s main YouTube channel has just reached the milestone of 10 million subscribers, making it the fourth British channel to reach that mark after One Direction, KSI and Adele.
Subscribers have become one of the key metrics to measure YouTube channels’ success, representing fans who have signed up to receive notifications when a creator posts a new video.
Zoella’s videos focus on beauty, fashion and collaborations with other YouTubers, although she has also addressed issues like anxiety and panic attacks.
In 2014, she became one of the first British channels to be promoted by YouTube with TV, print and billboard ads, alongside Vice News and The Slow Mo Guys.
Sugg’s main channel’s videos have now been watched more than 665m times on YouTube. She also has a second channel, More Zoella, which has nearly 3.9 million subscribers and 377.2m views – meaning across both channels she now has 1.04bn views.
Zoella reached the milestone of 1 million subscribers in April 2013, three years after joining YouTube. By the time of YouTube’s advertising campaign in 2014, she had 6 million subscribers.
Outside music, Zoella and Olajide “KSI” Olatunji are the two most successful British vloggers in terms of subscribers on YouTube. KSI’s main channel has 11.9 million subscribers, while his second channel has 4.2 million.
The most-subscribed-to YouTube channel belongs to gamer Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg, with 41.9 million fans signed up. Kjellberg is Swedish, although he lives in Brighton, so could also be claimed as a UK YouTuber.

Sugg continues to post regularly to her YouTube channels, but she has diversified into other areas. Her first book, Girl Online, was released in 2014, sparking a debate when it emerged she had worked with a ghostwriter.
A sequel, Girl Online: On Tour was released in 2015, but Zoella has also fronted her own collection of beauty products; sung on the Band Aid 30 charity single with fellow vloggers Alfie Deyes and brother Joe Sugg; and joined mental-health charity Mind as a digital ambassador.

The Tab’s national site will combine contributions from its thousands of unpaid student contributors with articles written by full time editorial staff.
The organisation has appointed former London Evening Standard journalist Phoebe Luckhurst as the new outlet’s editor, and given two Tab writers full time positions to create content for the site.
For the first time, it is also offering a cash incentive to contributing writers, and is trialling a “prize” scheme for those who get large numbers of article views or shares on social media with cash payouts of between £35 and £700.
The Tab started as a Cambridge University student site in 2009 but has expanded across UK campuses to claim 3 million unique browsers a month. In November it announced a £3m funding round designed to help it move into the US, where it says it has built an audience of 1 million across around 25 campuses, with plans for more localised operations.
The Tab has faced criticism for publishing stories that were not adequately fact checked, most notably an inaccurate story in 2009 about Lizo Mzimba for which it had to apologise. It has come under fire for a brash tone that in its early days included a feature called “Tab Totty” inspired by page 3. However, stories provided by its contributors have regularly been picked up by national news outlets.
The Tab: the student website making headlines Read more
New York-based executive editor Joshi Herrmann said the aim was initially to target people who had read the Tab at university but had now left, with many having moved to London.
“What we are essentially adding in is the layer of commissioning and writing centrally that can supplement what we do,” he said.
“Our initial aim is to go to people who used to read us at uni in the UK. There are a hell of a lot of grads in the UK who read the Tab pretty regularly. We want to create a website that will interest them, which they can read loyally again, which also has the best stuff from our student network.
“It’s people who used to read the Tab regularly, and we think there are a lot of those in London in particular.”"

Actor and comedian Stephen Fry is to return to the issue of his own bipolar disorder as part of a two-week BBC1 season on the issue of mental health which also includes popular soap EastEnders exploring the issues of postpartum psychosis.
The launch of a fortnight’s programming on the UK’s most-watched television channel, set to include several special reports on the main evening news bulletins as well as hard-hitting documentaries, demonstrates how mainstream the issue has become. The last time the BBC launched a season on mental health in 2013 it focused on young people only and aired on BBC3.
New NHS figures, revealed by the Guardian’s This is the NHS series, showed that the number of deaths annually among mental health patients in England has risen 21% over the last three years. The government’s campaign, Time to Change, launched last October to raise awareness about the issue among young people, comes amid mounting criticism of cuts to mental health services.
BBC1’s In the Mind season kicks off on 15 February with a primetime airing of a documentary which sees Stephen Fry return to the issue of his own disorder 10 years after his first award-winning show for BBC2.
In The Not So Secret Life of the Manic Depressive: 10 Years On, Fry talks about his suicide attempt while filming in Uganda in 2012, six years after the last show aired.
Now president of mental health charity Mind, Fry talks about how his own busy lifestyle exacerbates his own illness, which can be managed but not cured. Diagnosed with cyclothymia, a version of bipolar disorder considered less severe than some, Fry’s appearance in the two-part television documentary in 2006 went on to win an Emmy award for best documentary.
Charlotte Moore, controller of BBC TV channels and iPlayer said that a decade after this documentary is the right time to revisit the issue: “Now feels like the right time to bring this important subject to a mainstream audience on BBC1. To find out what has changed, what progress has been made and what the future holds for people living with mental health conditions in the UK.
“Over the last decade we’ve broken down taboos, and medical advances mean we have a greater understanding of the brain than ever before, but we’re not there yet. There is still so much more that needs to be done.”
James Harding, director of BBC News, says: “This is a moment when we stop and reflect on one of the big issues of our time, one that touches all of us. We will report and examine – with all the BBC’s expertise, insight and understanding – on what’s really happening in mental health.”
A key strand to the BBC1 season is a series of special reports set to be shown on the BBC’s main evening news bulletins at 6pm and 10pm. Topics will range from neuroscience to the NHS, and mental health in the black community.
David Brown, the project initiator for BBC News, said: “We’re aiming to make a real contribution to understanding of mental health in the UK. It’s a fantastic opportunity to do something special for the BBC1 audience with an issue which will almost certainly touch all of us at some point in our lives.”
Other documentaries include My Baby, Psychosis and Me, which details the real-life stories of two women who suffer from postpartum psychosis following childbirth. A storyline involving Stacey in EastEnders will involve the same issue.
When BBC3 launched the It’s a Mad World season, the headline-grabbing titles, including Don’t Call Me Crazy and Diaries of a Broken Mind, attracted some controversy but won plaudits for raising awareness.

Student campaigners have condemned an Oxford college for deciding to keep its statue of Cecil Rhodes, claiming the college has been influenced by a “dictatorship” of donors.
Activists in the Rhodes Must Fall campaign said Oriel College had “sold out”. They said “It is clear that Oriel has been influenced significantly by the threats of donors keen to maintain symbols of Cecil Rhodes.”
Ella Jeffreys, a master’s student, told the Guardian: “We feel that the decision of Oriel College, due to the threat of withdrawing funding by alumni, shows that money talks over students.
“Without any proper understanding they are whitewashing a serious and real history that still affects people today.”
The campaign said in a statement: “Oriel has been rushed into this decision by the irresponsible threats of wealthy individuals. This is a decision for the short term. It is a decision made by authorities, not by students. It is a decision motivated by power not by principle.”
The Guardian view on Cecil Rhodes’s legacy: the empire strikes back – good | Editorial Read more
The statement said the decision lacked “legitimacy” and warned: “It is a decision that jeopardises trust between students and the institution.”
Oriel College said last week that it would not remove the statue of Rhodes despite a campaign by students that has gained much media attention. The campaigners believe the British imperialist’s legacy should not be celebrated.
Last week Oriel said: “Following careful consideration, the college’s governing body has decided that the statue should remain in place and that the college will seek to provide a clear historical context to explain why it is there.”
It confirmed it had been warned of the possibility that it would lose about £100m in gifts should the statue be taken down. However, a spokesman insisted the financial implications were not the primary consideration.
Student activists said they would not be derailed by interventions such as those of Chris Patten, the chancellor of the university, who said in a recent interview that those involved with Rhodes Must Fall should “think about being educated elsewhere”.
They said at a packed press conference: “His intervention shows that it is the chancellor that is most concerned about avoiding uncomfortable debates and challenging discussions.
“Our campaign has never been about safe spaces. But the chancellor is clearly keen to carve out a safe space of his own, where debates about colonialism can be silenced and swept under the carpet.”

Campaigners released seven demands on Monday and said the debate was not just about the statue of Rhodes but also about the representation of students and academics and curriculum change, as well as iconography.
Students called for a reckoning from the institution, and said their first demand was for Oxford to “acknowledge and confront its role in the ongoing physical and ideological violence of empire”. They want the university to apologise for its role and to offer more scholarships to black students from southern Africa.

Campaigners also called for a commitment to recontextualising iconography and said: “Murderous colonists and slaveholders belong in books and museums, not on the side of buildings.”
They said they wanted to hear “the voices suffocated into silence by a Eurocentric academy”. They demanded a decolonised curriculum, as well as blind-marked applications and implicit bias training for all academic staff.
The campaigners called for an immediate end to “outright racism” at campus and also demanded the university “take responsibility for the culture it perpetuates” and to ensure the work of anti-racist students and staff was properly recognised and institutionalised.
Simukai Chigudu, a postgraduate student in international development, said Oriel’s decision “throws into sharp relief that strong power donors have in shaping the college and underscores that it is not a free, open and democratic [process].
“The key is to undergo the democratic and egalitarian process of canvassing opinion and ideas, and that is where the campaign needs to go.
There is a profound attachment and misunderstanding on the legacy of imperialism.
He added: “The university does not take the views seriously of students prepared to put themselves on the front line. Oriel and the chancellor [have shown] a dereliction of duty.”
Rhodes attended Oriel College in the 1870s before returning to South Africa. It was there that he founded the De Beers diamond empire. He became one of the world’s wealthiest men and rose to be premier of the then Cape Colony in 1890.
He is now chiefly remembered for beginning the policy of enforced racial segregation in South Africa and for his belief in the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race."

And with the number of state school pupils set to rise by a million by 2022, the problem is only getting worse
Jacquie Sainsbury left secondary school in Canvey Island, Essex around 30 years ago with one O-level. She had five kids before deciding to train as a teacher. In 2000, she left Derby University with a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE), and nine years later, she became the head of Brookhill Leys primary school in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire. I meet her there on a Monday afternoon: she and her deputy show me round before we sit down in her office and unpick exactly what it takes to make a success of a 430-pupil school in what she describes as “a very tough area”.
Eastwood sits in the heart of what used to be the Nottinghamshire coalfield. The last pit here closed in 1985, and the scars have yet to heal. “We’re in the bottom 20% of the deprivation indicators in the country,” Sainsbury tells me. “A lot of poverty.” She and her staff have to cope with regular challenges. “It’s not unusual for our teachers to be shouted at by parents; to have to deal with drunk parents,” she says. “The things that our staff have to deal with, you don’t have to deal with in an everyday walk of life. We’ve got fantastic parents, and we’ve got parents who need a lot of help.”
Brookhill Leys, it has to be said, does not feel like a “problem” school. Just over 45% of the children receive free school meals, compared with a national average of 16%; around a third are understood to have special educational needs of some kind. But walking around its airy, ordered classrooms, and watching everything from instruction in charcoal drawing to an avoidant 10-year-old who has just exited his classroom agree to make amends and go back in, the sense of something quietly remarkable is obvious. A good school is something you can sense inside five minutes. And this is one – with, for what it’s worth, a “good” rating from the school inspectorate Ofsted to match.
It’s not unusual for our teachers to have to deal with drunk parents
But for Sainsbury and her colleagues, things are getting harder, in the midst of what repeated headlines bluntly describe as a teacher shortage. When Sainsbury used to advertise a job vacancy, she got around 25 applications, which would then be whittled down to a shortlist of five. “Now we’re lucky if we get five applications,” she says. “A teacher needs to suit a school. Sometimes, we can get a teacher in, and think, ‘They’re really going to struggle here.’ But then you’ll get another one and think: ‘Yep – they’re going to fit in.’ We don’t get that choice at the moment.” Last year, she advertised for a teacher and received just one application – at which point, she decided to fill the gap with a young trainee.
While the level of new applicants shrinks, increasing numbers of teachers are getting out. Over the last four years, around eight teachers have left Brookhill Leys: more than double the number Sainsbury would normally expect. “We’ve got one at the moment who started in September at management level, and she’s just decided she doesn’t want to be a teacher any more.

Some of the factors behind stories like these are traceable to the New Labour years, but many are rooted in Michael Gove’s hyperactive four-year reign as education secretary. They go from never-ending paperwork, to a constantly changing regime of exams and assessments. Meanwhile, the prospect of a visit from Ofsted and the possibility of a bad inspection are a constant source of stress – not least because a “requires improvement” or the dread “inadequate” rating will mean even more upheaval.
On top of all that are the effects of the pay policy which froze teachers salaries for three years from 2010, and recently capped rises for most teachers at 1% until 2020. As any maths teacher could tell you, that means pay cuts in real terms – and more disaffection, as wages in the private sector start ticking up.
Teacher recruitment ‘a mess’ as every school slugs it out for itself Read more
“I’ve noticed that a lot of headteachers aren’t even bothering to advertise jobs any more,” Sainsbury says. “There’s a round-robin email that gets circulated, and a head will say, ‘Does anyone know of a teacher who’s available for September?’ No one will give an answer, but you’ll get four or five others who jump in on the back of it, going, ‘I’m looking for someone, too.’ I’ve never seen that before. Schools are desperate. They’re getting to the end of term, and they haven’t got anybody.
What is happening at Brookhill Leys is only one small part of a snowballing national story. The government insists that across England, teacher numbers and vacancy rates remain relatively stable, but even the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, acknowledges that there are some problems. Moreover, things look set to get worse. In 2022, the number of children in state schools will stand at just over eight million compared with seven million today.
At the last count, the number of temporarily filled teacher posts stood at 3,210, up from 2,300 the year before. The number of teachers working without a formal teaching qualification – which, let’s not forget, is allowed in academies and free schools – was just over 20,000, up from 16,600. The government’s own research shows that in the 12 months to November 2014, the state sector lost nearly 50,000 teachers – representing the highest rate of exit for 10 years and an increase of more than 25% over five years. More sobering still, 100,000 qualified teachers have opted never to work in a classroom at all.
‘Criminalised’ as a failing school – in the midst of Oxford’s wealthy spires Read more
In 2015, the number of graduates entering teacher training did go up – but it had fallen by a total of 14% over the previous four years. Among new trainee teachers, subjects such as physics and design and technology (or D&T) remain massively under-subscribed. The number of trainee teachers based in universities or colleges is falling, in keeping with the government’s controversial push to place aspiring teachers with schools, rather than higher education institutions. And here too, there are problems: the main programme aimed at training teachers that way is called School Direct, and it seems to have had consistent issues with a lack of take-up: in 2015, only 54% of the places set aside for new graduates were filled. (A DfE spokesperson says that the government has purposely over-inflated such target figures to signal their ambitions for the policy, and “just because we don’t hit that target, it doesn’t mean that’s a shortage.”)
A recent survey by the National Association of Headteachers found that 59% of schools advertising for staff had “struggled” to recruit, and 20% had failed completely. In London and the home counties, there seem to be acute problems caused by soaring house prices: one north London headteacher recently told me that some of his staff commute 50 miles. But judging by rising noise from schools all over England, the truth is that the teacher crisis is starting to hit pretty much everywhere, and affecting every level of the profession. Two weeks ago, the education charity the Future Leaders Trust added to the angst surrounding teaching with a report warning that schools were finding it increasingly hard to recruit headteachers, and that 28% of current heads had told one survey they were planning to leave their jobs within five years.
The DfE’s response to all this has a slightly conflicted tone. It insists that “teaching has a lower turnover rate than the economy as a whole”, and that “90% of teachers in state schools stay in the profession from one year to the next”. Talk of a crisis, it says, is “disingenuous and misleading”, and it goes on to bemoan “scaremongering”. But the DfE apparently does “recognise the challenges that some school leaders face in particular areas” – and says it has increased bursaries and scholarships to try to attract recruits in “priority subjects”, as well as creating the National Teaching Service: a new scheme aimed at sending 1,500 teachers and “middle leaders” to schools deemed “underperforming” by 2020.1

The central problem, though, is that nothing the government has proposed so far has allayed rising fears of the teacher shortage turning critical very soon – not on the part of political mischief-makers, but people who work in schools all over the country.
The same day I meet Jacquie Sainsbury, I speak to two ex-teachers. Nicola Deegan worked for 11 years as a French and Spanish teacher in the hard-pressed Merseyside suburb of Kirkby: at first, she says, she and her colleagues were given “a bit of creative control” over how they taught, and the workload seemed manageable. Soon enough, though, more and more time was eaten up by paperwork and marking based on individual targets for each student – “a box-ticking exercise” – that entailed two hours’ extra work each night, another couple of hours on Saturday mornings, and more time each Sunday, stretching into the evening.
Deegan took a year’s maternity leave in 2010, and came back to find that her workload had been ratcheted up yet further. “People didn’t seem to have time to breathe,” she says. “It was as though they wanted to get through the teaching day as quickly as possible because they knew how much other work they had to do. You’d think: ‘Oh, three more lessons to go – then I can tackle those mails, and that marking, and those assessments.’” She soon cut her hours to three days a week, but found herself working an unpaid extra day just to on top of things. “Part-time teaching is all the accountability and all the guilt for half the pay,” she says.
Deegan left her job in July last year. She now does a day-and-a half-of language teaching in primary schools, as well as some supply teaching – and earns just over half of what she used to. “For a long time, teaching was my identity: that was who I was,” she says. “But I won’t be going back to full-time teaching, or even part-time. Not a chance.”
Another former teacher, who prefers to remain anonymous, tells me she qualified in Scotland in 2007, and eventually took a job as a geography teacher in Sutton, in south London, paying £550 a month to share a flat with two other people. Her working day began at 7.30am, and she was responsible for 13 different classes, with all the associated paperwork. In an attempt to avoid burnout, she moved to Manchester and started supply teaching, before taking a full-time, £28,000-a-year job in Bolton, where the number of her classes increased.
If somebody had said, ‘You can have 60 grand a year to stay,’ I would still have said no
“I started in September 2012, and by December, I was diagnosed with depression, brought on by stress,” she says. She left teaching when she became pregnant and resolved not to go back. She now works for a children’s charity: “If somebody had said, ‘You can have 60 grand a year to stay,’ I would still have said no,” she says.
This sense of grind and impossible demands inevitably trickles down to trainee teachers. Andy Howes, who is in charge of secondary-school PCGE courses at Manchester University, tells me that stress about paperwork and marking is something that he regularly has to deal with. “It’s the day-to-day grind of some school policies that some trainees find difficult,” he says. “We have quite a lot of conversations with trainees, to say, ‘If that’s the situation, don’t stay. Find somewhere else.’ It’s a constant thread, definitely.”
Another factor, he says, is the government’s drive, chiefly via the School Direct programme, to push down the number of trainees based in universities and colleges, encouraging graduates to locate themselves in individual schools. “You have to decide: ‘Well, which school, or school partnership, do I want to put my trust in?’” he says. “You don’t know what you’re looking at as a graduate because you’ve not got the experience … I think that’s probably led to some people deciding that teaching’s not for them.”
He echoes concerns about subjects such as maths and the sciences feeling the pinch. “I think that’s a combination of the economy picking up, and the fact there’s just not that straightforward route into teaching,” he says. Howes runs a course for people who haven’t got degrees in physics – an A-level is the basic requirement – but want to become physics teachers. “The number of schools I’m working with who haven’t got properly trained physics teachers is massive,” he says. “You just keep coming across the fact that trainees are working with teachers who are not themselves trained in physics.” It takes me a while to process what this means, in some cases: people without physics degrees being helped to teach physics by people who don’t have physics degrees either.

The day after my trip to Eastwood, I arrive at another school in the middle of a former coalfield: Holy Trinity in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, a Catholic and Church of England school whose 1,150 pupils range in age from three to 16. The head here is 46-year-old Simon Barber: a one-time primary school teacher with a specialism in music – he plays the viola – who now manages 43 secondary school teachers, and 17 who work at primary level. The school – overseen by the local council, rather than being an academy – opened in 2012, and sits on a giant site, with buildings and classrooms that exude a sense of confidence and purpose in difficult circumstances. “We’re still emerging,” Barber tells me. “I don’t think we’re the finished article yet.”
At the end of last year, Barnsley was one of 13 places – just about all of them in the north, and also including Blackpool, Doncaster and Hartlepool – that Ofsted chief Michael Wilshaw said had too many schools “languishing in mediocrity”. Holy Trinity, in fact, has a “good” Ofsted rating, but Barber obviously thinks such a sweeping judgment caused nothing but problems, particularly when it comes to recruiting new teachers.
Barber hands me a sheet of paper recording all the vacancies he has advertised over the last few years, and how many applications he got back. A job teaching art attracted 18 – because, he says, thanks to the changes pushed through by the government, “schools are now actively reducing numbers of art teachers”, and many are going spare. By contrast, the numbers of people applying for jobs teaching English, science and computing never got any higher than four – and appointing a new head of maths, he says, was “an absolute nightmare”.
Appointing a new head of maths was a nightmare
Finding heads of departments, he says, is a particular problem, what with Ofsted ready to pounce, and results in key subjects so crucial for a school’s reputation: “If you’re the head of maths or the head of English, you are so accountable: if the maths department goes down, the whole school goes down.” For this job, the school got four applications, three of which were “no good”, leaving one that he says was outstanding. The applicant came from a large academy chain, which for some reason, had given her a poor reference.
“We couldn’t understand it – what we could see in front of us, and what the reference said were completely at odds with each other,” he says. He decided to employ her, and she accepted – but a few weeks before the end of term, he received a call saying she wouldn’t take the job after all. “The next thing I know, this chain was announcing its new head of maths in a brand-new academy,” he says. “Presumably, they offered her a better deal.” He suddenly looks pained. “I feel like the corner shop up against Tesco. These academy chains have huge resources, and lots of lots of schools. I won’t appoint anyone I don’t think is capable of doing the job. That would still be my official line. But the truth is, you do find yourself thinking: if I don’t appoint this person and I advertise again, that’s going to cost me another £3,500 when money is really tight.”

A couple of years ago, he says, he lost one of his art teachers. “She was absolutely brilliant,” he says. “The kids loved art; she switched them on to it. I was loving it, seeing kids wanting to do art, and doing really well in the exams. And then she said: ‘I can’t cope with it. I go home every night, and I cry.’ She got out of teaching and she’s doing something completely different now.
It’s a small story: one regrettable episode in the midst of thousands. But in all kinds of ways, it means a lot. “She was an absolutely amazing teacher,” he says, quietly. “A massive loss.”"

David Cameron was wrong to blame top universities for a lack of diversity as the problem partly lies with state schools being unable to prepare their students for Oxbridge, headteachers have said.
Last weekend, the prime minister accused his alma mater, Oxford University, of “not doing enough to attract talent from across our country”, pointing out that 27 black students out of a total of 2,500 went to Oxford in 2014.
John Weeks, headmaster of the London Academy of Excellence (LAE) in Stratford, east London, said the criticism of Oxford and Cambridge was unfair as they had done “huge amounts in terms of outreach” for students from diverse and deprived backgrounds.
University of Oxford rebuts Cameron's claims over student diversity Read more
He said the problem was simply that there were not enough applications to top universities from pupils from deprived and black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, and that post-16 provision in some areas was not strong enough.
As university vice chancellors attended a hastily convened meeting at No 10 on Monday to discuss the prime minister’s concerns about diversity, headteachers highlighted the disadvantage faced by state schools with little or no history of sending students to Oxbridge.
Last month, eight LAE students, who have all grown up in the deprived borough of Newham, were offered places to study at Oxbridge, leading to the selective sixth form free school being known as the Eton of the East End.
While delighted with their success, Weeks readily acknowledged that much of it was due to the college’s partnerships with leading public schools including Eton and Brighton college who helped set up the academy three years ago.
“Where we’ve been very lucky is we’ve been able to tap into the experience of our independent school partners who have hundreds of years of experience of getting their children into Oxford and Cambridge.”
Reiss Akhtar, 17, who has a place to study English literature at Cambridge, benefitted from that – he had four weeks of coaching to support his application and sat two mock interviews at fee paying schools; one at Eton and one at Brighton college.
Jack Wands, meanwhile, was the first ever pupil at St Andrew’s Roman Catholic school in Glasgow to get an offer from either Oxford or Cambridge.
Headmaster Gerry Lyons said the school had never thought of putting any of its students in for Oxbridge as its focus had been to increase numbers going into higher education, which has increased 11% over the past three years.
It was Jack, “an ordinary working-class boy” from Garthamlock, who decided he wanted to try for Oxford after visiting the university during an internship organised by the Social Mobility Foundation.
Lyons and his team helped with the application but he also received extra help from St Aloysius, a partner private school, with a good record of successful Oxbridge applications. Now he’s been offered a place to study philosophy, politics and economics.
“There should be more young people from state schools going on to universities like Oxford and Cambridge,” said Lyons. “How we help them to do that is pretty patchy. I know they run summer schools but it doesn’t feel very systemic.
“I would prefer not to go to St Aloysius for help. There should be much more systemic support for young people so that any school can help a young person get into Oxbridge, not one that happens to have a link to a private school.”
After the Downing Street meeting, which was attended by the vice chancellors of both Oxford and Cambridge among others, the business secretary Sajid Javid, said: “Universities have made good progress but we can’t stand still.
“More needs to be done to improve access and outcomes for disadvantaged and [BAME] students. That’s why we’ve announced plans for a new transparency duty to shine a spotlight on where progress is being made and where institutions could do much more.”

Critics lashed out at government hypocrisy, accusing ministers of calling for greater diversity at universities while introducing policies that could produce the opposite effect such as the trebling of tuition fees and the removal of maintenance grants for lower income students.
Kate Green,the shadow minister for women and equalities, said that while an increasing number of students from BAME backgrounds are studying at university, too many are still denied the chance to study at some of the top universities. “We support calls for universities to do more to attract and enrolstudents from a diverse range of backgrounds,” Green said, “but those from low income families will be deterred by the removal of maintenance grants by the Tories which could leave students facing high levels of debt on graduation.
“Once again, we see the Tory government stating high aims on equality while at the same time implementing policies which only serve to embed and entrench inequality.”
Dalia Gebrial, a member of Rhodes Must Fall Oxford – the student group that has been campaigning for the removal of the statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes from Oxford’s Oriel college, said the fact that the prime minister had recognised the disparity in higher education should be welcomed.
She did, however, add that Cameron’s words were “blunted by the fact that the government has put in policies that make it difficult for working class people who are disproportionately people of colour.
“It’s not about squeezing people of colour into inhospitable places but addressing the broader structural issues hanging over such institutions,” Gebrial said. “David Cameron’s words don’t mean anything when the government’s policies are doing the opposite.”
On Monday, the Rhodes Must Fall group condemned the college for deciding to keep its statue of Rhodes, saying it had been influenced by a “dictatorship” of donors."

Pastor Maldonado will not be on the Formula One grid next season with Kevin Magnussen, the former McLaren driver, tipped to replace the Venezuelan at Renault.
Maldonado, 30, who made his grand prix debut for Williams in 2011, was backed by the Venezuela’s national oil company PDVSA. But their contribution – reported to be more than £30m for the new season – has not materialised and Renault opted to release him.
Magnussen, who raced for McLaren in 2014 before he was moved sideways following the arrival of Fernando Alonso, the world champion in 2005 and 2006, is set to be Maldonado’s replacement. The 23-year-old Dane will partner Britain’s Jolyon Palmer, the former GP2 champion, who is set to make his F1 debut. Renault are expected to reveal their driver lineup in Paris on Wednesday.
“Today with much humility I must inform you I won’t be on the grid at the start of the 2016 season,” Maldonado said in a statement. “Thanks for all the messages of support, passion and concerns about my future.
“I’m very thankful to God, my family, my sponsors, my friends, my fans and everybody who has helped me realise this dream of having represented Venezuela in the pinnacle of motor sport. See you soon!”
Maldonado has started 95 races and won the Spanish Grand Prix for Williams, the British team’s last victory, in 2012 but his career has been blighted by number of crashes and errors.

Eddie Jones loves an analogy and, with the Calcutta Cup looming on Saturday, his recipe for Scottish beef is already in the oven. “It’s like a slow cooker, mate. You put the meat in and put the temperature on low then it just simmers for a while. That’s where we are at the moment.” As England’s coach will shortly appreciate, however, serving up the perfect Six Nations dish is rarely that easy.
Greig Laidlaw: ‘The jersey means so much but you can’t go on the field thinking that’ Read more
For all the talk of fresh starts, the championship spits out anyone who is even fractionally hesitant off the mark. Two years ago England lost by two points in France in their opening game and even four subsequent wins could not secure them the title.
Jones’s first match in charge, given the scant time he has spent with his squad, is more about lobbing a few hastily identified burgers under the grill and hoping they defrost in time.
Hence his desire to try to make Scotland stop and think by casting them as favourites. Mind games have long been among his trademark skills in contrast to Stuart Lancaster and Martin Johnson who preferred to respect their next opponents to death. On Monday, for example, Jones even offered to write to his opposite number, Vern Cotter, to apologise for suggesting the hosts should be favourites. “I know he was upset about that so I apologise to Vern. If you want me to write a letter, I’ll write a letter of apology. We’re happy to be favourites. We’ve had a good preparation and we’ll go in there confident about playing well.”
All good knockabout stuff and Jones is a past master. He has long believed that simply sitting in press conferences and reading out the latest groin-strain updates is a waste of everyone’s time. “Every time we talk to the media we are trying to find a way to win. I don’t see that as mind games, it’s just part of the process. I think it is an important part of the game. Warren Gatland does it exceedingly well, doesn’t he? Clive Woodward wasn’t too bad at it and he’s knighted. So he was knighted for doing mind games!”
It was Woodward who criticised the poor feng shui in the away dressing room at Murrayfield after England’s win there in 2004, suggesting a large pillar had been deliberately placed to “screw up” the feel of the room. As England won comfortably it cannot have been too bad but Jones, despite an unbeaten record in Edinburgh with Australia, is also wary.

“The Scottish are canny people. I remember the time the pitch was being re-marked three hours before the game. The [English] guys are telling me you get to within 10 minutes of the ground and a host of bagpipers appear and do a slow march in front of the bus. People painted with blue crosses are going to be screaming and yelling. That’s what Test match rugby is about, isn’t it?”
His firm belief is that outcome matters rather more than how England are perceived north of the border. “Arrogance is only bad when you lose. If you are winning and you are arrogant then it is self-belief. We’re going to believe we are going to be the best team in the world. If that’s being arrogant then it is being arrogant. To me it is belief about what we can be.”

The first step is to crank up their forward power, with extra running and pre-dawn gym sessions already the norm. Some are finding it a culture shock. “It’s a bit depressing walking over to the gym in the dark at 6.30am,” said the prop Mako Vunipola, but Jones is unapologetic.
“We’ve just jumped in the pool and we’re only at the shallow end at the moment. We’ve still got the deep end to go. By Saturday night we’re going to know a lot more about the team and I think it’s going to be pretty good.”
Whether they sink or swim in Edinburgh will be fascinating. The Northampton tighthead Kieran Brookes may be available and it is hoped his club-mate Courtney Lawes will train fully on Thursday. If not, Maro Itoje could conceivably be promoted to the 23 after impressing the watching Jones during Saracens’ weekend home win against Bath.
Jones also confirmed he remains in regular contact with Sale’s Danny Cipriani – “He knows he’s in the picture but we can’t pick everyone” – and has his eyes peeled for whoever appropriated his birthday cake at the weekend. “I did get a cake. I think someone took it, though … maybe one of the props.” Vunipola hinted there may well have been sticky fingers in camp. “I don’t want to put anyone in it but I just want to clear my name,” said the loosehead. “I wasn’t there.”"

Surrey have announced a second major signing in the space of a week with the Australia Twenty20 captain Aaron Finch joining the club this summer.
Finch will replace the veteran wicketkeeper-batsman Kumar Sangakkara while the former Sri Lanka captain is away at the Caribbean Premier League, which is due to start in July.
The 29-year-old opener is one of the most destructive batsmen in the world – highlighted by his Twenty20 world-record innings of 156 against England three years ago – and his signature comes after Surrey announced that West Indies all-rounder Dwayne Bravo would join them for the T20 Blast this summer.
Finch will be available to play in all three formats and has first division experience having spent the past two seasons at the county champions Yorkshire.
“This is a great opportunity for me and one I am very much looking forward to,” Finch said. “To have the chance to play all forms of the game is a challenge I will relish, as I have ambitions to represent Australia in Test match cricket.
“I’m aware that Surrey have an exciting young squad and I hope I am able to add to their obvious talent.”
The Surrey director of cricket, Alec Stewart, added: “Securing a player of Aaron’s quality for such a busy period of red and white ball cricket is excellent news for the club and I’m confident we will see his qualities in all formats of the game.”
Finch is currently recovering from a hamstring injury that could yet rule him out of the World T20, which begins next month. The World Cup winner suffered the problem during Australia’s 3-0 Twenty20 series defeat to India, although scans have revealed the problem is not as bad as the hamstring injury he suffered last year, which required surgery and delayed his arrival at Yorkshire.
“Although this current injury doesn’t require surgery there is a period of rehabilitation required before he can resume playing,” Cricket Australia’s sports science and sports medicine manager Alex Kountouris said. “We are aiming to have Aaron fit for the ICC World T20 in India but will have better idea about his fitness for that tournament in the coming weeks once we see how he responds to treatment and a rehabilitation program.”"

South Africa have called the all-rounder David Wiese into their squad for the first two one-day internationals against England, starting in Bloemfontein on Wednesday.
Wiese replaced Albie Morkel, who was added to the squad on Sunday but has since been laid low by back spasms and will take no part in the five-match series.
Wiese made his ODI debut against New Zealand last August and played all three matches of that series. The 30-year-old has also featured in 12 Twenty20 internationals. He is a medium-pace bowler and destructive lower-order batsman.
Wiese played for South Africa A against England in a warm-up fixture in Kimberley on Saturday, taking two for 73 in 10 overs and scoring a rapid 28."

Dai Young’s nerve in declining to select the four players released by their countries in midweek was the subject of much discussion before the game at Franklin’s Gardens on Friday night. In the event the Wasps director of rugby’s faith in his squad was more than justified, especially during a first half throughout which every one of his players out-performed his opposite number to a degree which left the home crowd genuinely nonplussed, and gives Saints’ director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, serious cause for concern. Particularly worrying must have been the inability of his players to react to the unfolding situation, and Tom Wood, captain on the night, was not exaggerating in calling the performance a “disaster”. Saints have been grinding out results this season, particularly at home where their defence has been, or at least had been, solid, but their attacking options are looking increasingly limited. When everyone is fit, available and in form, they’re going to win matches, but it takes genuine depth to win trophies, along with the ability to produce the unexpected. At the moment, it is not clear Northampton have either. Richard Rae

2) Turnover ball is back in fashion
The winds of change are blowing through the Premiership with teams now appreciating the attacking value of turnover possession. Leicester, for so long disciples of the pick-and-go and one-pass movement, are running from deep when taking back possession and even forwards are indulging in fancy off-loads that not so long ago would have cost them 100 press-ups in the Monday morning review of a match. The change has come about since the arrival of Aaron Mauger as head coach. The former All Black fostered an approach that sees the ball moved when space is there to be opened up and kicked when it is not, principles that helped New Zealand win the last two World Cups. The Premiership, with a couple of exceptions, was a tournament where territory was king and where what Eddie Jones called sequence play was the fashion, but Leicester were comfortable with and without possession against Gloucester, waiting for the right moment. It is what Jones is looking to instil in his England players and teams like Northampton and Bath, who have built their games around what they do when in possession, are struggling to keep up. Paul Rees
3) Goode might have the last laugh
While Saracens are cruising clear at the top of the table, pulling Exeter along with them, things are far closer at the foot of the Premiership. Away wins for the three sides nervously contemplating life in the Championship next season are at such a high premium that home form is crucial and so on the same day that Worcester, who travel to London Irish on Sunday, went toe to toe with the Chiefs for large spells and left with nothing, Newcastle came from behind to clinch an invaluable win over Harlequins at Kingston Park and climb off the bottom of the table. Andy Goode’s physique has always been the source of amusement in the stands but his talent was never in doubt. His decision to come out of retirement and join Newcastle inevitably prompted a few chuckles but his ability has evidently not diminished and judging by his nerveless kicking performance against Quins nor has his relish for the occasion. His signing by Dean Richards may just prove a masterstroke. Gerard Meagher
4) Hill states case for England call-up on return for Chiefs
Eddie Jones’s 23-man squad raised a few eyebrows last week, not least for his decision to pick Ollie Devoto and release Elliot Daly. On one hand the decision makes sense; Devoto covers both centre positions (not to mention a couple of others) whereas Daly does not cover 12, but such thinking does not chime with the southern hemisphere sides’ willingness to pick specialists on the bench who can adapt if needs be. But If Devoto is there as the next available 12, after Owen Farrell, then we can at least assume that Sam Hill would be if not just returning from injury. His cameo against Worcester was impressive, making some piercing runs while showing an awareness of what was outside him. With Hill picked by Jones as cover for Henry Slade and Devoto in for Manu Tuilagi, it is reasonable to infer that Hill is above Devoto in the pecking order by virtue of Slade having no chance of playing in the Six Nations; Tuilagi has some chance, albeit diminished by a new hamstring injury. Hill will be back at Exeter on Sunday and will probably start against Saracens but do not be surprised to see him feature for England in the coming weeks. GM
5) Back to the drawing board for Bath
Eight months on from the Premiership final that these two contested last season, Saracens, the champions, sit two points clear at the top of the table after beating Bath again. The 19-13 score line scarcely tells the tale of a match in which heroic defence by the visitors kept Saracens pointless at half-time. It was Bath though who failed to score any points after the break and went on to lose their fifth game on the bounce in all competitions. While this match was played without any of their England internationals, no one in their set-up would have expected them to be languishing ninth in the table after the promise of last season. Since the beginning of November they have won only four times in 12 games domestically and in Europe. Next up are Gloucester at home on Friday night, a team who Bath have not lost to in the league since 2012. Claire Tolley"

The 29-year-old has won 16 caps and was part of England’s 2015 World Cup squad, although he did not make England’s elite player group announced last month by the head coach, Eddie Jones.
“Rob fits perfectly into what we are trying to create at the club,” the Sale rugby director, Steve Diamond, said. “He is a talented all-round player who is great at the set-piece and very mobile in the loose. He is at the top of his game and will bring with him a wealth of experience.”
Webber, who made more than 100 appearances for Wasps before joining Bath in 2012, added: “I am really looking forward to the new challenge ahead. I have spoken to Steve Diamond and the lads I know at the club, and they have all spoken highly about the environment at Sharks.”
Diamond, meanwhile, said that Sale would be making more signings over the coming weeks."

It is the calm, measured tone of Greig Laidlaw that should concern England most. Before most Calcutta Cup encounters the auld enemy rhetoric tends to swirl as thickly as winter mist across a Highland grouse moor. Not this year. “We know how much the jersey means to the Scottish people but you can’t go on to the field thinking that,” Laidlaw says, flatly. “It really did feel as if that’s why we played a lot better during the World Cup.”
Six Nations preview: the bold will be rewarded in era of new beginnings | Eddie Butler Read more
Hang on, can that be right? A Scotland team at Murrayfield actively trying to block out the pipers, the kilted bandsmen and the traditional “homeward tae think again” exhortations? With a Six Nations championship kicking off shortly something really must be up. At this rate the hosts will be serving crustless cucumber sandwiches in the press box and asking tenderly after Will Carling’s health.
Even Laidlaw, a proud son of Jedburgh, is currently resident in Cheltenham: the “Cotswolds Braveheart” does not have quite the same intimidatory zing. Peek beyond the ancient cultural rivalry and neighbourly banter and a much more worrying prospect awaits the visitors: a Scotland squad quietly convinced they will not just sneak home this Saturday on a gale of passion and emotion but beat the English at their own, cool-headed game.
For not since David Sole’s famously slow walk on to the field in 1990 have Scotland been so deliberately calm and – whisper it – optimistic. As Laidlaw confirms, their World Cup efforts have given Scottish rugby the inner confidence it has lacked for too long. The tournament may have ended painfully, with the fleet-footed Craig Joubert’s infamous late refereeing decision allowing Australia to escape in a riveting quarter-final at Twickenham, but it has removed the inferiority complex built up by eight years of Calcutta Cup frustration.
“It is a good place to be,” says Laidlaw, who detects a direct link between Scotland’s improvement and not allowing a tartan haze of national fervour to cloud their focus. “We want to go down that same route again because we felt we got a lot of payoff from it. There’s always baggage but there are no preconceptions. I don’t like saying: ‘We’ve got nothing to lose’ because you’re playing for Scotland. There are always things to lose; you’ve just got to be smarter in the way you go about it.”
The 30-year-old Laidlaw, so often Scotland’s tactical ringmaster, admits he learned this lesson the hard way. Last time England were in Edinburgh two years ago Scotland lost a soulless contest 20-0, only the second time since 1921 they had failed to muster any points against England at home. The then Scotland coach, Scott Johnson, openly criticised his “naive” decision-makers while a stone-faced Laidlaw, his key playmaking lieutenant, was sitting alongside him.
That gruesome memory has not entirely faded, even on a breezy morning at Gloucester’s Hartpury College base. “I captained that day and, personally, it was one of my worst games for Scotland,” Laidlaw acknowledges. “We probably overdid a few things beforehand and we were almost paralysed by emotion. That’s where we got the balance right during the World Cup. You’ve simply got to concentrate on putting big energy into your performance. I think I did that during the World Cup and played some of my best rugby. I’ll be trying to use that template again but it’s not easy when you run out in front of a 67,000 sellout Murrayfield crowd.”
Hence the determination of Vern Cotter and his players to concentrate instead on fulfilling their potential. Given they have never finished higher than third in the Six Nations and have won only once on the opening weekend since 2000, this may sound a relative aim but in Johnny Gray, WP Nel, John Hardie, Josh Strauss, Finn Russell, Stuart Hogg and Mark Bennett – if fit – Scotland are gathering a bristling clan. They are also keen to prove the World Cup, not least the three-try quarter-final salvo against the Wallabies, was no fluke.
“Having had that frustration last time we wore the jersey we want to have some positive feelings again,” Laidlaw, nominated for the 2015 World Rugby player-of-the-year award for his role in Scotland’s resurgence, murmurs.
With a settled spine to the side – “that consistency goes a long way towards helping the team and the coaches” – his squad also have the benefit of kicking off the tournament at home for the first time since 2012. Eddie Jones’s portrayal of England as underdogs, reckons Laidlaw, may just help fuel the fires, too: “We’re buoyed we’re at home. Expectation is high but you’ve got to see that as a positive. We played well in the World Cup but we’ve also got to understand nothing is going to come easy. No one’s going to give us any favours.”

He is too modest to add that Scotland also have another potential advantage: their crafty, versatile captain. Laidlaw is set to draw level this weekend with his uncle, Roy, on 47 caps; the equally tenacious Gary Armstong, another Borders legend, is also now within sight on 51. If Laidlaw leads Scotland in all five championship games he will also overhaul Sole as his country’s most-decorated captain. Not bad for a player who did not make his debut for Scotland until he was 25 and weighs barely 12 and a half stone.
For the same small Borders town – population 4,000 – to produce three such eminent Scotland internationals may not be entirely coincidental. While in Cheltenham Laidlaw has a photo of Riverside Park, home of Jed-Forest RFC, both to remind him of his roots and to give him daily inspiration. “I’m hugely proud of where I come from and the people I represent back in Jed. When you grow up in a small town you realise what it means to the people. I’m the third scrum-half and the third captain of Scotland from Jed. That’s unique. You don’t want to let those individuals down, never mind the whole town. How would I describe the people? Tough, uncompromising, pretty honest. It’s always good to go back. You’re treated the same, which is the great thing about the town. They’ll tell you what they think. Whether it be good or bad it never goes unnoticed.”
The trick now is to emulate some of the success enjoyed by uncle Roy, one half of Scotland’s greatest half-back partnership with John Rutherford. The former once joked he would be sent to a taxidermist when he died, so often did Bill McLaren compare his burrowing style to a Border terrier, a ferret or “a well-nourished mole”. He also recalls young Greig, aged only five, kicking a ball over the local club’s main stand but Laidlaw Jr insists he is still down the family pecking order. “Forty-seven caps in his day was probably worth a hell of a lot more. It’s difficult to compare but he also played in a successful period for Scotland and won a grand slam. To win something for Scotland is far more important than counting your caps. It’s about what you do during your caps rather than the number you get.”
Eddie Jones is happy for England to be labelled arrogant Read more
Despite the proud tradition a small part of him hopes his young son, Ruary, will choose another sport. “It’s a tough game. You get a lot of bangs and head knocks – is it going to get better or worse? I don’t know and nobody really knows. It’s relentless week in, week out and it isn’t doing your body a great deal of good. Sometimes, especially this season off the back of a World Cup, it’s absolutely manic. I love the game – and if my son wants to play it I’m not going to discourage him – but if he wants to play golf or tennis I’d certainly usher him towards that first.”
In a perfect world he would also prefer fewer scrum penalties – “people come to watch rugby, they don’t come to watch penalties” – and a global season. “Eventually it might have to happen because New Zealand and Australian players have a huge advantage over us. They come off the back of that World Cup and have three months off. We’re straight into the season, then a summer tour. It is relentless.
“Summer rugby would be a big decision but it might even help Scotland. Playing in better weather at, say, Jed-Forest or Hawick – you could get people along on a nice Saturday afternoon, put on a barbie afterwards and suddenly a bit of community comes back into the club. It would certainly help the standard of the game in this part of the world, in my opinion.”
For the moment, though, it is the wintry ambush of England that consumes this sharpest of rugby brains. Scotland have been plotting for weeks, while Jones is still learning his players’ names.
Laidlaw says the anger and disappointment of losing to Australia will never disappear completely but suspects Cotter will barely mention it this week.
“We’ll never get that [Wallaby] game back, so you can’t keep looking for excuses and asking people to feel sorry for you.
“You look forward and the next time you wear the jersey you try to win and put a bit more history into it. That’s exactly what we’ll be doing come Saturday.”"

Johanna Konta has been forced to pull out of Great Britain’s Fed Cup squad for their Europe/Africa Zone Group I event.
Konta, who reached this year’s Australian Open semi-final, where she was beaten by the eventual champion Angelique Kerber, was due to line up in Israel next week alongside Heather Watson, Anna Smith and Jocelyn Rae, but she is now out of contention with an intestinal problem.
“After having consulted with two doctors, my coach, physio and the LTA, unfortunately I will have to withdraw from the upcoming Fed Cup in Israel,” read a statement from Konta, who has risen to No28 in the world rankings after her success in Melbourne. “I have been advised by the doctors that playing there would jeopardise an ongoing intestinal issue that got progressively worse through the Australian Open.
“This comes as a big disappointment to me and I regret not being able to play. I have represented GB every time I have been asked to and fully intend to play again given the opportunity in the future.”
Great Britain are paired against Georgia and South Africa in Pool B. Their captain, Judy Murray, said: “While it’s obviously very disappointing, we still have a squad of players capable of winning through the Euro/Africa Zone Group I.
“I have a couple of days to fill the fourth spot, and that gives two of our most promising teenagers Katie Swan and Freya Christie the chance to join Heather Watson and our doubles specialists Jocelyn Rae and Anna Smith in the team.”
Konta beat Venus Williams in the first round of the Australian Open andwent on to become the first British female player since Jo Durie to make a grand slam semi-final."

At the culmination of a spell that has proved the epitome of golfing globetrotting, the Texan admitted constantly crossing from the PGA Tour to the European Tour is a stiff ask.
Spieth has played in South Korea, China, Australia, Abu Dhabi, the Bahamas, Hawaii and, finally, Singapore since November. The last of those events concluded in semi-farcical fashion, Spieth having to return to the course on Monday simply to putt out on the 72nd hole for second place.
“It’s been a wild schedule,” Spieth said, “and what I’ve learned is that I won’t bounce back and forth from the States over here as often as I did. It’s just tough. I’m very pleased with how I performed with all of this travel. But there’s a lot of people on the European Tour and the Asian Tour who do this every single year, so for me to sit here and complain is tough [on them].”

Spieth’s time in south-east Asia was affected by an injury to his caddie, Michael Greller. It meant his manager, Jay Danzi, had to take bag duties. Spieth will next appear at the more routine surroundings of Pebble Beach next weekend.
“I’ll get enough rest,” the 22-year-old said. “I’m going to familiar places that I don’t have to play 36-54 holes prior to playing these events. Then I’ll have a bigger break in the middle of the season to get ready to really have my game once these compressed majors and the Olympics and the FedEx Cup play-offs and Ryder Cup are all there.
“It’ll almost feel like it’s a new season to me. We’re doing a good job of trying to separate a part of the season to make it almost kind of two halves versus a complete continuation of no rest.”

Frank Bruno, the former heavyweight boxer who has fought a very public battle with mental illness, has announced he wants to return to the ring as a way of avoiding psychiatric hospital.
Bruno, who won the WBC heavyweight belt in 1996 and is now 54, said he had been training daily and felt compelled to come out of retirement to fight again.
Interviewed on ITV’s This Morning programme, he spoke openly about his bipolar disorder that had led to him being sectioned three times since it was diagnosed in 2003. He admitted himself to hospital in September last year after suffering a bout of severe depression.
“I’ve got to get back into boxing, to get this out of my system, because I don’t want to end up in Broadmoor hospital,” Bruno said. “I’ve been in the gym all the time, that’s why I want to come back into boxing.”
The presenter Phillip Schofield questioned whether it was sensible to return to the sport. Bruno responded: “Is that a good idea? I haven’t got no choice. I train every day.”

Bruno said he objected to being challenged by younger boxers, saying he did not want to be “mugged off” when he was still fit and well.
“I can’t sit down and let these so-called promoters say [current British heavyweight champion] Anthony Joshua can knock me out in two rounds when I’m not even dead.”
Bruno also revealed that some of the drugs prescribed for his condition had made him feel worse. “They made me suicidal. They mess up my head. I can’t sleep. I have so much energy,” he said.
In order to fight again professionally, Bruno would need to be granted a licence by the British Boxing Board of Control [BBBoC].
On Monday evening Bruno tweeted: “My agent has received notification from the British Boxing Board of Control that should I apply for a license this would not be granted.”
Earlier, a spokesman for the organisation told the Guardian: “Mr Bruno has not made an application for a BBBoC boxer’s licence and should such an application be received it will be considered in the normal manner by the stewards of the board.”"

The gelding will be one of two possible runners for O’Neill in the Aintree race, for which entries will close at noon on Tuesday.
“He’s in grand form,” O’Neill said of Shutthefrontdoor, who has not been seen in public for more than two months. “He ran well in a hurdle race at Liverpool in November but then the ground got really heavy and he wants good ground.
“When he gets pulled around on heavy, he’s not the easiest horse to keep right. I wanted to run him at Sandown this weekend but when I saw it was heavy, I thought I won’t even enter him.
“If you were a jockey, he’d be the sort of horse you’d look forward to riding in the National. He jumps really well.”
Stamina is the issue for Shutthefrontdoor, as his trainer readily concedes. Carrying AP McCoy in the jockey’s final National last year, the horse was in contention before tiring from the second-last.
“For me, he just didn’t get home,” O’Neill said. “But then he didn’t have a run beforehand. I wanted to get one into him but it didn’t work out.”
And so, in the interests of putting a sharper edge on Shutthefrontdoor before 9 April, O’Neill is hoping to give him “one or two” runs, ground permitting. But he also hopes the horse’s cause might be helped by a “more professional” display at Aintree this time, he having been rather free through the early stages last year.
O’Neill’s other National entry will be Holywell, although the trainer is feeling rather nonplussed about this one after a “very disappointing” display when pulled up at Doncaster on Saturday. “He didn’t go a yard, the little monkey. We’ll enter him and see how he goes between now and then.”
Holywell has an established pattern of moderate form in midwinter followed by much better efforts in the spring, usually at Cheltenham, and O’Neill said he would probably be entered in the Gold Cup, in which he was a game fourth last year. “But he’s not good enough, really.”
Smad Place, such an impressive winner at Cheltenham on Saturday, will not be tackling the Grand National, despite being quoted by a couple of firms. “His owners are not really Grand National people and I respect that,” said his trainer, Alan King, who added that the Gold Cup-bound grey “seems absolutely fine” after beating Many Clouds by 12 lengths in the Betbright Trial.
Grand National start time moved to 5.15pm in attempt to boost TV audience Read more
King’s only National entrant is likely to be Midnight Prayer, a winner over four miles at the 2014 Festival, when he was a novice. “The only thing is, he’d be borderline for making the cut at the bottom of the weights,” the trainer said. “He’ll run in a veterans’ chase at Exeter on the 14th and hopefully do well enough to go up a few pounds.”
Smad Place may be missing when the National entries are revealed on Wednesday but his fellow Gold Cup contender Don Poli will be on the list, being one of six horses that Willie Mullins expects to put in the race. The others are On His Own, Sir Des Champs, Ballycasey, Turban and Valseur Lido.
Pressed on which of those were more likely to turn up on the day, the champion Irish trainer said all six were “just entries at this stage”. In similar vein, he has five horses in Saturday’s big race, the Scilly Isles Novice Chase at Sandown, but has yet to begin the process of choosing which of them should actually travel."

Super League 2016 preview: Still going strong after 20 years of ups and downs Read more
Reports in Australia over the weekend said Bennett, a former Australia coach and the most successful Australian coach in rugby league history, had been approached by the RFL to replace Steve McNamara, who is not expected to be retained, despite guiding England to a series victory against New Zealand last year.
Bennett will bring his Brisbane Broncos side to England later this week for the World Club Series, the tournament that pits three NRL sides against their Super League counterparts. He is then expected to finalise the England details in meetings with the RFL chief executive, Nigel Wood.
The RFL would not comment on speculation linking Bennett with the job but it did issue a statement on the status of the review that began in November after the series against New Zealand, which read: “As we have previously stated, it is only right and proper we conduct a thorough review of the England programme following the conclusion of Steve’s contract. We expect that review process to be completed this month and we won’t speculate or comment further until the process is complete.”
Bennett confirmed the approach about taking over from McNamara and could even complete the deal before he arrives in the UK. Of paramount importance to the 66-year-old was that he was able to continue coaching the Broncos. He told the Brisbane Courier Mail: “It may be before then. If someone picks up the phone in the next week, the next couple of days. I have to find out what I want to do and how they see me involved.
“I’ve told the Broncos what I’m doing and the people who matter are across it – they are totally supportive of it, as they were of me when I applied for the Australian coaching job. I could do the Australian job without impinging on what I was doing with the Broncos. It is the absolute priority for me.”
What remains to be seen is whether Bennett appoints an assistant coach based in the Super League to help prepare England for the Four Nations. McNamara was based in the NRL like Bennett, working as the assistant coach at Sydney Roosters. The Castleford coach, Daryl Powell, and Wigan’s Shaun Wane would be the two favourites to join Bennett."

Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook
It wouldn’t be a winter Monday without attritional action at Plumpton, so thank goodness the Sussex track has passed an early inspection to give us our fix of jump racing. That being said, I’d stop short of calling this card attractive betting fodder and the treacly surface means the races will have to be timed with a calendar rather than the usual stopwatch.
Mogestic (2.45) just about appeals at 4-1 in the handicap hurdle for conditional jockeys. From the Seamus Mullins yard that is having a decent winter, this seven-year-old got off the mark on his seasonal reappearance, finishing strongly in the mud at Exeter last month.

The way he ran that day suggests this extra half-mile will help and, in Jerry McGrath, he has one of the better pilots on offer. I like Royale Knight but he’s a chaser really and hasn’t won over the smaller obstacles for more than three years.
Wolverhampton’s card starts with another of those amateur races in which the mount of Simon Walker, Fairy Foxglove (2.00), looks by far the best option, despite short odds. I feel that the identity of the jockey is also behind the price of India’s Song (4.10), the winner of her last two but available at a surprisingly big 9-2 because the betting market is suspicious of 7lb-claiming female jockeys.
But Sophie Killoran, the jockey in question, is on an upward curve and was aboard India’s Song for her two recent successes. The mare still looks fairly treated.
I like the step up in distance for Quite A Story (5.15) in the last race at Wolverhampton. She was well fancied for her return from a break recently but blew the start and may have needed the outing. She’s 100-30 this time.

State of Origin|Rugby league|NRL|Australia sport|news,2016-02-01T09:07:50,guardian,Australian Associated Press,Cronulla’s Valentine Holmes has been identified as the player at the centre of an Emerging Origin squad controversy that might embroil up to six Queensland hopefuls,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/01/unnamed-queensland-pair-banned-origin-ban-for-misbehaving-qld-hopefuls,Queensland pair banned from State of Origin contention after breaking curfew,en,sport|rugby league,,"Another alcohol-inflicted hangover looms for the NRL, with Cronulla’s Valentine Holmes identified as the player at the centre of an Emerging Origin squad controversy that might embroil up to six Queensland hopefuls.
Queensland Rugby League boss Peter Betros told AAP two players – later identified as Holmes and Melbourne’s Cameron Munster – would be blacklisted by Maroons’ selectors for a year for breaching curfew at the weekend camp in Brisbane.
However, up to six players who attended the camp were being investigated by the QRL after reports several broke curfew and Holmes was involved in a Fortitude Valley incident with police.
Disgraced NRL star Mitchell Pearce leaves for overseas rehabilitation Read more
Days after Mitchell Pearce apologised for his Australia Day bender, the NRL integrity unit is investigating Holmes after the QRL and Cronulla had each issued a statement on Monday, identifying him as the player involved in “an alleged incident”.
It is believed the camp’s 20-strong squad were told not to go out after returning from a team dinner on Saturday night. However, up to six players later left for the Fortitude Valley nightclub precinct with Holmes allegedly involved in the incident with police.
New Queensland coach Kevin Walters had rammed home what had been expected from his Origin players just hours earlier at the camp – his first in charge of the Maroons.
“Our club has been made aware of an alleged incident involving Valentine Holmes amongst other players during a Queensland Emerging Origin training camp last weekend,” a Cronulla statement said. “We are conducting our own inquiries into this matter in addition to assisting the QRL with their investigation.”
QRL managing director Robert Moore confirmed Holmes and Munster were the banned players.
“Cronulla Sharks player Valentine Holmes broke curfew during the Emerging Origin camp and is subject to further investigation by the QRL and NRL integrity unit,” Moore said. “Melbourne Storm player Cameron Munster has been excluded solely for breaking curfew.”
Moore did not rule out bans against more players “if they were identified as breaking curfew”.
Walters was furious. “On Saturday afternoon, we sat down as a group and spoke about the importance of making the right choices,” he said in a QRL statement. “Regrettably, there were some players who made poor choices after we had wrapped up the official part of that day’s program.”
Betros said it was the worst possible first impression Holmes and Munster could have made with Walters. “The Queensland Rugby League won’t be selecting them for anything for 12 months,” Betros told AAP on Monday.
“It’s a massive setback for those players. It’s the only way they will learn. Kevin is very disappointed in them. He is strong on discipline. He feels those players don’t want to buy into what he is doing with Queensland. They can go back to club land.”
Newcastle’s Dane Gagai was also banned for 12 months for skipping a training session at the 2014 Emerging Origin camp. He had to wait until game three last year to make his Origin debut for Queensland."
Charities|Opinion|Kids Company|Voluntary sector|Camila Batmanghelidjh|Children|editorials,2016-02-01T19:06:26,guardian,,Editorial: Fundraising scandals and the downfall of the Kids Company both point in the same direction – strengthened support for the volunteers who safeguard the voluntary sector,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/the-guardian-view-on-britains-charities-building-trust-in-trustees,The Guardian view on Britain’s charities: building trust in trustees,en,opinion|editorials,,"The House of Commons report into the collapse of the Kids Company charity that was published on Monday divided opinion almost as much as the charity’s formidable and charismatic founder Camila Batmanghelidjh does. Some of the arguments, over how many children were really on the books, how results were measured and whether the Cabinet Office was misguided to continue to fund it, will take months, perhaps years, to resolve. But the report also makes important points with much broader consequences about how to manage the voluntary sector that plays such a big role in so many communities.
Charity finances are under strain, yet too often the expertise to assess and manage risk is missing from trustee boards
Charities have taken a terrible buffeting over the past few months. The suicide last May of Olive Cooke, a 92-year-old fundraiser who was overwhelmed by the literally thousands of begging letters she received, cast a dark shadow over techniques employed by a sector that occasionally seems to be focused more on how much cash it can squeeze out of its supporters than on the good it can do. Months later Kids Company folded, with a welter of accusations of mismanagement on every side. Ever since, an air of crisis has hung over institutions set up and supported by people who only want to do good. The common thread between the two events has been a failure of governance – the fragile relationship between a charity, its beneficiaries and its supporters that relies on the vigilance of its trustees.
There are more than 165,000 registered charities in the UK and probably 500,000 trustees ranging from local activists to highly qualified lawyers and accountants. Almost all of them are volunteers; many will have little management experience. There is some free support available – the national organisation for charities, the NCVO, offers a downloadable guide, for example – but the public spending cuts since 2008 have simultaneously reduced the amount of support that is freely available and have made many charities more vulnerable. More than £2bn has been taken out of the charitable sector. Government contracts have become too big for charities to be able to compete, and they have had to rely on an insecure role as subcontractors. As a result, charity finances are under strain, yet too often the expertise to assess and manage risk is missing from trustee boards.
Hard cases make bad law. Dealing with the particular governance challenges at Kids Company that are still being fought over – the well-recognised problem of “founder syndrome”, where a single committed individual can dominate trustee boards, for example – will not help to restore the sector to public esteem and may end up making things worse. According to the Charity Commission’s register, nearly three-quarters of charities have an annual income of less than £100,000 and only 2% have incomes on anything like the scale of the £23m that Kids Company showed in its last published accounts. Few charities work as closely with vulnerable children. The combination of its huge income, the way it responded to need rather than setting up programmes for a defined number of children, and the vulnerability of its clients, put a particular burden on the charity. It is hard to argue with the need identified in the MPs’ report to build up reserves so that, at the very least, Kids Company might have had a cushion that would have allowed it to put its affairs in order when it ran into the storm that forced it to close in August last year. Nevertheless, very few charities will find themselves in similar circumstances.
Charities continue to play an invaluable part in civil society …They must be protected and modernised
After Olive Cooke’s death, the government accepted that there should be a new, independent regulator to oversee fundraising. The charities bill that is now going through parliament will also give the Charities Commission more nuanced regulatory powers so that it can do more to support charities on a day-to-day basis. But there is a strong case too for much more support, advice and continuing training for the trustees who guard the reputations of individual charities and the sector as a whole.
Charities continue to play an invaluable part in civil society. They provide ongoing support for the needy and vulnerable. And they act as an outlet for millions of ordinary people who want to do some good in the world. They must be protected and modernised. Yet at the same time it is also imperative that any new burdens imposed upon them can safeguard the baby – the thousands of small, local, high-impact charities – while the sad bathwater of high-profile bad management is being glumly emptied down the drain.

Sundance 2016|Film blog|Virtual reality|Sundance film festival|Casey Affleck|features,2016-02-01T19:07:34,guardian,Lanre Bakare|Nigel M Smith,"From sexting politicians and slave revolts to virtual reality hype and big-money buys, Sundance has been as interesting as ever. Here’s what caught our attention",https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/feb/01/sundance-film-festival-2016-six-things-we-learned-park-city,Sundance 2016: six things we learned from the film festival,en,culture|film,,"Although it’s been a disappointing 12 months for Sundance favourites at the box office, that didn’t stop Netflix and Amazon from turning up at Park City and spending serious money. Netflix’s attempted acquisition of The Birth of a Nation for $20m was seen off by Fox Searchlight for $17.5m, with director Nate Parker favouring Fox’s ability to get the film shown far and wide. But money wasn’t the only storyline to emerge from the Sundance fortnight.
Advances in technology, films that merged documentary and fiction, and others that took on divisive topics all turned heads at Park City. Here’s our rundown of what made an impact in 2016.
Virtual reality intrigued at Park City
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Virtual reality at Sundance.
The New Frontiers exhibition at this year’s festival opened the doors of perception when it came to virtual reality. There was a lot of buzz after this year’s offering was revealed (seriously, every other publicist’s email was about VR), and despite the hyperbole there were signs that for film-makers it could be more than just hot air and inbox spam. The Guardian’s own offering (6x9: An Immersive Experience of Solitary Confinement) and the New York Times’s films showed how journalism is continuing to harness the technology to bring subjects – such as solitary confinement – to life.
Film-makers such as Milica Zec also took viewers inside an experience – in her case a bombing raid in an urban area – but also made the experience a communal one, with three people watching the film at the same time. That leap from solitary experience involving a repurposed cardboard box and a smartphone into something grander and ultimately more profitable is what has excited many. But the varied ways film-makers used VR in their films – whether they were comedies or horror – regardless of whether if it was communal is what excited the most.
Guns
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Under The Gun: hits its target. Photograph: Josh Salzman
If there was one bona fide trend at Park City it was of film-makers taking on gun violence and gun control in creative ways. Tim Sutton’s Dark Night, a “mock-documentary with elegantly framed tableaux”, received mixed reviews but brought the Aurora cinema shooting to centre stage at the festival. Newtown focuses on the harrowing accounts of the survivors and families affected by the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting. Under the Gun made a polemic case for gun control reforms and showed how, although central government may be stalling, at state level changes can be made. All were eye-opening, all got across the pain that gun violence leaves on all communities. Whether Under the Gun will have an effect on the debate or if it will just be seen as one side’s biased account is yet to be seen, but the impact of it and the other gun-related films could do for gun control what The House I Live In did for America’s awareness of drug sentencing.
#OscarsSoWhite’s impact was felt in Park City

The first week of Sundance was dominated by the biggest film story of the past year: the debate around diversity in the industry. One by one stars were asked about their opinions, and some of their answers continued the furor that overshadowed much of the festival’s first seven days. Julie Delpy said she’d rather be an African American person than a woman working in Hollywood, before backtracking on her comments. Matt Damon said dealing with the Oscars was just one of the many things that need to be done before the industry really addresses diversity. Kristen Stewart encouraged action rather than protest when it comes to the debate around pay inequality for female actors/directors. The Sundance bill itself was packed with diversity of subject matter and in terms of who was making the films. Kiki, Maya Angelou and Still I Rise, White Girl, Sleight, The Birth of a Nation and Life, Animated all delved into worlds rarely seen in the mainstream and confirmed Robert Redford’s suggestion that independent cinema is inherently diverse.

Many coming into Sundance probably weren’t familiar with the name Christine Chubbuck. By the time the festival wrapped, there was no escaping it. The television news reporter’s story is the stuff of urban legend: she achieved notoriety in 1974 after shocking the world by taking her own life live on air. The footage of her suicide has mysteriously never surfaced. In what is in all likelihood a Sundance first, two films about the same subject matter played at the festival – both examining what led Chubbuck to kill herself for the world to see. In the narrative competition was Christine, Antonio Campos’s dark character study, featuring a largely unrecognizable Rebecca Hall as the tragic figure. Competing in the documentary section was Robert Greene’s Kate Plays Christine, a decidedly more experimental endeavor in which actor Kate Lyn Shiel prepares to play Chubbuck for a fictional film on her life. Both films, though unrelated, manage in their own ways to humanize a person who up to now was simply known for how she died.
Potential Oscar players emerged
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Armie Hammer, left, and Nate Parker in a scene from The Birth of a Nation. Photograph: Elliot Davis/AP
Sundance has long served as a launchpad for future Oscar players (and in many cases, winners). In the years since, Sundance smashes like Precious, Beasts of the Southern Wild, Fruitvale Station, Whiplash, Boyhood and, most recently, Brooklyn, have gone on to break through to the mainstream to enter the awards race. A number of Sundance titles from this year’s edition are poised to join the ranks, chief among them: The Birth of a Nation. It led the Sundance winners, claiming both the audience award and US grand jury prize, mirroring Whiplash’s victory in 2014. Like Whiplash, expect it to factor in the Oscar race for best picture.
Kenneth Lonergan’s ecstatically received drama Manchester-by-the-Sea looks as though it could join it, with Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams as standouts for the acting categories. Of the documentaries (in recent years, Searching for Sugar Man and Twenty Feet From Stardom began their journeys at the festival before going on to Oscar glory), the frontrunner out of the new batch is Weiner, winner of the US documentary grand jury prize, which tracks Anthony Weiner’s disastrous mayoral bid in 2014, followed closely by Life, Animated, an incredibly moving film that explores how films helped an autistic person communicate with the outside world.
Amazon and Netflix need to decide if they’re in the TV or movie business Read more
Amazon and Netflix are the future of independent film
The two streaming services arrived at Sundance ready to pounce on new content; and buy they did, proving that following Netflix’s recent bold release strategy for Beasts of No Nation, film-makers are willing to take the plunge. Although Netflix lost out on The Birth of a Nation to theatrical distributor Fox Searchlight, it strode into the festival with a number of high-profile buys already made for the Ellen Page and Allison Janney comedy Tallulah, for which Netflix reportedly paid $5m, and The Fundamentals of Caring, a road trip movie headed by Paul Rudd, that cost the company a reported $7m.
Netflix continued to dominate, netting the Iranian horror movie Under the Shadow and the teenage rape documentary Audrie & Daisy out of the festival. Not to be outdone, Amazon nabbed the second-hottest buy of the festival following The Birth of Nation: Kenneth’s Lonergan’s probable Oscar player, Manchester-by-the-Sea. Part of Amazon’s $10m deal to acquire the film is said to include funds for an awards campaign down the line. Amazon also netted other buzzy titles, including Complete Unknown, starring Rachel Weisz, Todd Solondz’s dark ensemble comedy Wiener-Dog, and Whit Stillman’s Love & Friendship, which reunites his stars from The Last Days of Disco, Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny, for a Jane Austen romp."

Animated sequel Kung Fu Panda 3 scored a respectable $41m on debut to top the US box office this weekend, but Oscar-winner Natalie Portman suffered a career-worst opening on the troubled western Jane Got a Gun.
Directed once again by Jennifer Yuh Nelson, this time with Alessandro Carloni, the new Kung Fu Panda film sees the roundhouse-kicking bear meet his birth family for the first time, as well as graduating to become a teacher of martial arts. Strong reviews and a voice cast featuring Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan and Seth Rogen once again fuelled the film’s North American success.
Kung Fu Panda 3 did even better in China, where it pulled in $58.3m, the biggest animated opening of time. The sequel is the first in the trilogy to be co-produced by DreamWorks Animation and Shanghai-based Oriental DreamWorks, which guaranteed it a preferential release under China’s restricted system.

There was less positive news for the week’s other new releases. Coastguard drama The Finest Hours, starring Chris Pine and Casey Affleck, landed in fourth spot with just $10.3m on debut, a disappointing return given the film’s lavish $70m budget. Reviews have been decent, if not stellar, with Deadline labelling Craig Gillespie’s movie “an entertaining and expertly crafted Coast Guard tale”.
Fifty Shades of Grey spoof Fifty Shades of Black failed to perform, taking just $6.1m in ninth place. The film sees Scary Movie regular Marlon Wayans as Christian Black, a riff on EL James’ kinky businessman Christian Grey from the popular erotic romance novels and film. Critics have not been kind, with Slant Magazine calling the movie “an aimless, if sporadically clever, parody that tirelessly conceives of human sexuality as punchlines for its shortsighted cultural ribbings”.
Jane Got a Gun, starring Portman in the title role of a farmer forced to take desperate measures to protect her life and home, landed outside the top 10 on debut with just $830,000 in North American receipts. The film’s travails have been well-documented: Original director Lynne Ramsay quit production on the indie drama in March 2013, prior to the first day of shooting, following a three-day standoff with producer-financier Scott Steindorff.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nothing in sight ... Natalie Portman and Joel Edgerton in Jane Got a Gun Photograph: PR
The western was ultimately completed by Warrior’s Gavin O’Connor, who was called in at short notice with production already under way. Ramsay’s departure also saw Ewan McGregor replace Jude Law as the villain, while Joel Edgerton had earlier replaced Michael Fassbender in a heroic role. The acclaimed Scottish director of Morvern Callar and We Need to Talk About Kevin later found herself the subject of a legal action, but the two sides settled out of court in March 2014."
Biopics|Janis Joplin|features,2016-02-01T09:00:24,guardian,John Patterson,"With no starry, big-budget biopic in sight, Amy Berg’s new Janis Joplin doc is an insightful reminder of a vivid yet complex figure",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/01/janis-joplin-little-girl-blue,Janis: Little Girl Blue - a heartfelt account of a remarkable talent,en,culture|film,,"Hollywood’s long-promised, big-budget Janis Joplin biopic has been in the pipeline for what seems like 30 years now. And it never happens. I bet there’s been a Janis movie on the docket of one studio or another ever since the day she died in October 1970. The most recent projects have at one time or another attracted stars such as Amy Adams, Renée Zellweger and Zooey Deschanel. Pink has been slated to play her, as was the late, great Brittany Murphy at one time. Directors such as Catherine Hardwicke, Fernando Meirelles, Jean-Marc Vallée and Lee Daniels have been attached, only to pull out months or years later. In memory, she remains frozen in a kind of mish-mash of 1974 concert documentary Janis, Monterey pop festival and Woodstock footage, and parts of The Rose, with Bette Midler as Not-Janis.
So she remains today the least understood member of the Triple-J Club (Jimi, Janis, Jim); someone whose moment, which was brief and somehow perfect, makes less sense the further away it gets. However, for an intelligent portrait of her, head straight for Amy Berg’s superb new documentary Janis: Little Girl Blue, which incorporates revelatory interviews with family, friends, band members and associates (some long since dead), a good deal of stirring live and archive footage, and a lot of insight from people who knew her well.
Janis Joplin’s creed was ‘get stoned, stay happy’ but the highs had a dark side Read more
It strikes a fine balance between the Janis we think we know – the strung-out psychedelic white-blues belter who roared out of Haight-Ashbury in 1967 and found instant stardom after slaying them at Monterey – and the other half of her. Namely the Texas teenager with the classic, boring, suburban 50s, Manson-girl childhood (smart, odd-duck kid, loving but distant parents) who – as she grew up – routinely found herself athwart her times, her place, her gender, her sexuality and all the conventional expectations of her, including the retrogressive race norms of her day. She defied and transcended those expectations in the grand manner, going from Port Arthur outcast to major San Francisco scene-insider in three years, but she still wrote home to her family every week and remained that yearning Port Arthur girl somewhere deep inside. Without that side of her, well filled out here by Berg, Janis Joplin almost wouldn’t make sense, and her music would likely lack that essential woundedness that animates it from within.
Best of all is the chance to reacquaint oneself not only with the real Janis – so naturally charming and funny (and a dream chatshow guest, as some Dick Cavett Show footage proves) – and her gigantic voice, but also with Janis the unexpectedly magnificent fashion icon, decked out in boas, tons of rings, big pink sunglasses, gold dresses, striped bellbottoms, the works. Style-wise, she was her own masterpiece. To quote a Facebook meme I spotted recently: “In a world of Kardashians, be a Janis!”"

“I will be in the next Star Wars movie. I think that’s an exclusive, actually,” she said. “I was very overexcited. I made no secret of the fact that I really campaigned for the part for a long time. And then I was delighted when JJ Abrams wanted to have me in the film and then wanted to cast me in this role that had originally been designed for a man.”

Christie, 37, added: “I thought the costume was incredibly striking. I also just liked this notion of a female stormtrooper. I felt it encouraged diversity and it was doing something new and it was an interesting bit of casting for women, and I hope that in something that was such a mainstream success it would breed more of those kind of opportunities for other women.”

The Game of Thrones actor has previously said she was particularly pleased to note that Phasma’s chrome-plated costume remained unaltered once she was confirmed in the role.
“I was struck by how incredible it looked, but also I liked that it was stormtrooper armour,” she told People earlier this month. “It hadn’t been sexualised or feminised in any way. I thought, ‘That is interesting. That’s very modern.’”
Captain Phasma, a stormtrooper leader in the First Order cabal, is expected to be given a bigger role in Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: Episode VIII, which is now due to debut in December 2017 after being pushed back from May next year. In other Star Wars news, the first DVDs of The Force Awakens are reportedly set to go on sale on 5 April in the US.

Refn, who is currently finishing his thriller The Neon Demon, which is set in Hollywood and features Keanu Reeves, Elle Fanning and Christina Hendricks among its cast, may make it his next directorial project.
No other details of the film have been released, but Refn is already working with Purvis and Wade on the Amazon-backed TV series Barbarella (based, like the 1968 film, on the cartoon strip by Jean-Claude Forest). Purvis and Wade, meanwhile, who have writing credits on six 007 films stretching back to 1999’s The World Is Not Enough, are working on another prestige TV series, alternative-history SS-GB for the BBC.
Refn also has Button Man: The Killing Game in development – based on the 2000AD strip about hitmen hired to kill each other for sport – and is producing a remake of 1988 slasher Maniac Cop."

Are you as greedy, selfish and nasty as the financial wizards somehow portrayed as heroes in The Big Short? If so, now could be the time to emulate your role models.
The Big Short review – Ryan Gosling and Christian Bale can't save this overvalued stock Read more
The surprise Oscars best picture frontrunner shows Christian Bale’s Michael Burry, along with a sundry bunch of disciples, anticipating the 2008 crash, betting against the market and making it big when the sky falls in. A boom seemed to be under way, but they spotted its achilles heel. Marvel’s Avengers might have opted to save the world, but Burry’s gang find a higher purpose in their own enrichment. Should you share their approach to life, current conditions must surely look tempting.
Now, as a decade ago, everyone’s behaving as if the economy were sound. After all, unemployment is falling, incomes are rising, consumer confidence is at record levels and inflation is flat. Global growth forecasts may have been trimmed but they’re still healthy, and investors are being advised to ride out a dose of unexpected market turbulence.
Yet that turbulence is far from the only reason to suspect that another disaster may be looming. The last decade’s vast debt overhang hasn’t gone away; it’s merely been sidestepped temporarily with the aid of monetary jiggery-pokery. Among the many emerging chinks in our economic armour is the very element on which Burry fastened: the prospect of a wave of mortgage defaults when artificially low interest rates eventually have to rise.
Of course, in any venture of your own you won’t have access to the credit-default swaps that enabled Burry & Co to bet directly on the collapse of the sub-primes. Yet if the whole house of cards is going to tumble once more, there are plenty of other doomed activities on which you can set your sights. Shorting assets isn’t as easy as it used to be, but for the determined vulture, plentiful opportunities remain.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Big Short - video review
You will, of course, need money to buy your stake. Not to worry: like Burry, you can use other people’s. He had investors, but if necessary you can resort to Wonga. Unfortunately, you’ll have to keep servicing your debt until your bet pays off. If this takes longer than you expect, you’ll be ruined before you can make your killing. Solving this problem is much harder than discerning impending catastrophe.
How historically accurate is The Big Short? Read more
In truth, it’s not difficult to spot a bubble. The Big Short would have you believe that only “a few outsiders and weirdos” saw 2008 coming. Not so. Big-shot investors, high-profile economists and policy researchers together with financiers, politicians, bureaucrats and journalists all issued warnings. Yet they couldn’t say when the crash would come. No one ever can. That’s what makes shorting, most of the time, a mug’s game.
Yet Burry believed he had cracked the problem of timing. Sub-prime mortgages had been sold with low, introductory interest rates. Many would convert to variable rate (and rocket up) at about the same time. The housing market would collapse at this precise moment. He was therefore uniquely equipped to bet on a sure thing.
The film is awestruck by this stroke of brilliance, while being obliged to record that it didn’t turn out to be all that brilliant after all. One element of the stratagem might have been fixed, but an array of other variables went unnoticed. Burry’s investors could have abandoned him and almost did. When the mortgage default wave struck, the banks proved able to rig the market to obscure its impact. Bent ratings agencies chose to back them. If the banks had gone bust instead, they wouldn’t have paid out. Any of these unanticipated factors could have blown apart the supposed master plan. As it happened, none of them did. That wasn’t because the shorters were geniuses; it was because they got lucky.

So if you want to follow their example, your mighty intelligence won’t be enough. Just like any other kind of gambler, you’ll need good fortune as well. And there’s a reason why you won’t deserve it.
The Big Short presents its heroes as subversive warriors taking on the greed, folly and corruption of the evil banking establishment. Yet their own efforts contributed to the suddenness and severity of the crash, thereby augmenting the evictions and redundancies it precipitated. The sale of credit-default swaps weakened banks’ resilience. Meanwhile, it induced them to create even more dubious, synthetic mortgage bonds.
This kind of consideration doesn’t bother Michael Burry. He’s driven by the kind of fanatical compulsion that Hollywood tends to confuse with missionary zeal. In this film, sociopathy earns you a free pass.
However, for Steve Carell’s hedgie, Mark Baum, it has to be more of an issue. Mark, you see, is inspired by righteous outrage. Working in finance so charred his soul that he couldn’t coax a suicidal brother back from the brink. Shorting mortgage bonds helps him get back at those loathsome banks. So when he realises that he’s just as bad as his foes, he’s plunged into torment. He agonises and agonises. Then he cashes in, just like the others. Brad Pitt’s retired banker is supposed to be reformed, but he lends the conspirators a hand just to help them get rich.
The Big Short: how Wall Street's crimes have been portrayed by Hollywood Read more
In fact, the shorters aren’t as bad as the bankers; they’re worse. It’s not just that they’re hypocrites; they’re also parasites. Sub-prime mortgages may have been abused by the bankers who rolled them into bonds, but originally they had a worthy purpose. They were designed to provide the poor with homes, and as such were welcomed by progressives, including Bill Clinton. Credit-default swaps, on the other hand, were never more than instruments of greed.
So, imitating the sordid chancers of The Big Short might bankrupt you morally as well as financially. Don’t do it. Instead, why not watch a decent film about the 2008 crash? I recommend Margin Call. It didn’t win best picture but it told an honest tale."

It might seem crass to discuss next year’s Oscars ahead of this year’s, which have been mired in controversy after – for the second year in a row – no actors of color were nominated. But thanks to the 2016 Sundance film festival, which wrapped on Sunday, there’s simply no avoiding the discussion.
The Park City event, founded by Robert Redford, has long served as a launchpad for future Oscar players (and in many cases, winners). In 1989, Steven Soderbergh’s sex, lies and videotape netted the audience award, receiving an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay a year later and months after winning the Palme d’Or at Cannes. In the years since, Sundance smashes such as Precious, Beasts of the Southern Wild, Fruitvale Station, Whiplash, Boyhood and most recently Brooklyn have gone on to break through to the mainstream to enter the awards race. A number of Sundance titles from this year’s edition are poised to join the ranks, chief among them: The Birth of a Nation.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nigel M Smith reviews The Birth of a Nation from the Sundance film festival
As the first film to center on the story of Nat Turner, a former slave in America who led a violent liberation movement in 1831 to free African Americans in Virginia, Nate Parker’s directorial debut had near-deafening buzz coming into Park City. Anticipation was so high that Parker received a standing ovation at the film’s premiere before it screened. His film was graced with an even lengthier one after it played, confirming The Birth of a Nation as an audience favorite. Buyer interest was immediate, with Fox Searchlight, the distributor that led 12 Years a Slave to Oscar victory in 2014, ponying up $17.5m for the film – a Sundance record.
Rebecca Hall at Sundance: Hollywood is scared of 'ugly' female characters Read more
Although critical reaction has been decidedly mixed (the Guardian’s Lanre Bakare called it “heavy-handed”, while Variety’s Justin Chang praised it as “searingly impressive”), the powerful subject matter and timeliness in the wake of the #OscarsSoWhite controversy and the Black Lives Matter movement, is sure to push it the front of the pack when the race heats up. It led the Sundance winners on Sunday, claiming both the audience award and US grand jury prize, mirroring Whiplash’s victory in 2014. Like Whiplash, expect it to factor in the best picture Oscars race.
Possibly joining it is Kenneth Lonergan’s devastating drama Manchester By the Sea. Ecstatically received by critics, the latest from the You Can Count On Me writer/director sold to Amazon for $10m. Like all of Lonergan’s output, it’s relatively small scale, and therefore faces a bigger uphill battle than The Birth of a Nation. It’s expertly crafted screenplay shouldn’t go ignored. The same goes for the wrenching performance from Oscar-nominee Casey Affleck, who plays a janitor reeling from a family tragedy. Michelle Williams, as Affleck’s grieving ex-wife, only factors into a handful of scenes, but stuns in a pivotal sequence. She could very well earn her fourth Oscar nomination for her supporting turn.
Rebecca Hall is equally deserving of a nod for her astonishing work in Antonio Campos’ dark character study Christine, about Christine Chubbuck, the news anchor who achieved notoriety in the 70s for killing herself on live TV. Hall, who’s never been afforded a role this complex and demanding, delivers the performance of her career. The film is likely too grim to factor strongly into the discussion, but if the film’s eventual distributor (it’s currently without a home) plays its cards right, Hall will have a very busy autumn.

Molly Shannon would also be wise to block some time off this fall for campaigning on behalf of her supporting performance in this year’s Sundance opener Other People, as a mother suffering from terminal cancer. Shannon quietly devastates in a role that proves the comedian is equally as skilled at drama.
Breaking Bad Emmy winner Anna Gunn also deserves a mention for her powerhouse performance as a ruthless senior investment banker in the taut feminist financial thriller, Equity.
Little Men review – Ira Sachs' achingly humane family drama soars Read more
Of the other films to premiere at Sundance, watch out for Ira Sachs’ family drama Little Men. Sachs’ last film, Love is Strange, landed on many critics top 10 lists in 2014 and managed to receive a few Independent Spirit Awards noms. His latest is sure to win over any voter who comes across it – it’s too affecting to be ignored.
Additional standouts include Sing Street, John Carney’s musical follow-up to Begin Again, and the crowd-pleasing comedy Morris From America. Songs from the former could potentially be up for best song, while Chad Hartigan’s script for the latter stands a shot at possibly netting a nod (it won the screenplay award at Sundance).
Sundance has always been a hotbed for some of the year’s best documentaries (in recent years, Searching for Sugar Man and Twenty Feet From Stardom began their journeys at the festival before going on to Oscar glory), and this year was no exception. The frontrunner out of the new batch is Weiner, winner of the US documentary grand jury prize, which tracks Anthony Weiner’s disastrous mayoral bid in 2014, followed closely by Life, Animated, a moving film that explores how films helped an autistic person communicate with the outside world."

Dubbed the “DuVernay test”, the initiative was first posited by New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis in a review of this year’s Sundance film festival.
SAG awards: diversity is the night's winner in pointed counter to Oscars Read more
Ava DuVernay (@AVAETC) Wow. Floored. What a lovely cinematic idea to embrace. What a thrill to be associated with it. Absolutely wonderful. https://t.co/zjoWBBIKVy
The long-established Bechdel test, first proposed by the US cartoonist Alison Bechdel in a 1985 comic strip, requires two women to talk to each other about something other than a man to prove its egalitarian values. Dargis said her “DuVernay test” would merely require “African Americans and other minorities [to] have fully realised lives rather than serve as scenery in white stories”.
While the critic appears to have used the term as a light-hearted framing device for a piece on diversity in Sundance movies, the concept may have legs. DuVernay’s name symbolises the ongoing battle by African American film-makers to get movies made in Hollywood, given the furore over the Oscars’ decision to limit her acclaimed civil-rights drama Selma to just two nominations (for best picture and best song) in 2015.
After the feminist film blog Women in Hollywood tweeted about Dargis’s coinage, DuVernay posted: “Wow. Floored. What a lovely cinematic idea to embrace. What a thrill to be associated with it. Absolutely wonderful.”
How the SAG awards will affect the Oscars Read more
In a blogpost, Slate magazine’s Megan Logan suggested the concept could be developed. “Though the Bechdel test is, of course, an over-simplified yardstick for feminism in film, it remains a simple, straightforward way to begin the conversation about how any given movie humanises its female characters,” she wrote. “Perhaps it’s just as well that Dargis doesn’t propose any specific measure for the DuVernay test; rather than producing a simply binary yes/no, it can serve similarly as a way to begin discussing the diversity, representation, and depth of the stories of minority characters in the films we make and watch.”
The idea of a Bechdel test focused on racial as opposed to gender diversity has been proposed before. In 2013, the author Nikesh Shukla suggested the “Shukla test”, requiring two ethnic minorities to talk to each other for more than five minutes about something other than race.
In the wake of the ongoing row over the all-white lists of Oscar nominees, bloggers Nadia and Leila Latif proposed a more complex test for racial diversity in film. In a piece for the Guardian, they suggest films should feature two named characters of colour with lines of dialogue, who were not romantically involved with each other and did not talk about comforting or supporting a white character. The bloggers also said neither of the two main black characters should conform to the hated “magical negro” stereotype."

Dreamworks’ Kung Fu Panda series reportedly caused some grumbling in China about its appropriation of local mythology. But not only is it increasingly successful there, the country is becoming the financial bedrock of the franchise. Number three in the series this weekend opened bigger in China ($58.3m, a record for animation in a country lukewarm on the genre) than in the US ($41.3m). Cleaving to the typical franchise decay curve in America, the new instalment has all the momentum in China, where, in a first for the series, it was developed as a full co-production. That meant that Dreamworks knew about the release date further in advance, allowing it to finesse its marketing better; the film gets to stay in cinemas longer than the 30 days allowed for foreign imports; and the company gets to keep a larger box-office share. Its new subsidiary, Oriental Dreamworks, reportedly honed the script and animation to better reflect local sensibilities and language, and recruited a top-notch voice cast to replace Jack Black and colleagues in the Chinese version: Jackie Chan and summer 2015’s local breakout star Bai Baihe are at the top of the list.
With all that in its favour, Kung Fu Panda 3 should comfortably beat KFP2’s $92m Chinese haul, and will have the country’s $153m record for an animated film – held by last year’s Monkey King: Hero Is Back – in its sights. That level of performance is actually a must for the franchise: the US is predictably tailing off, while results from Russia and South Korea this week (Russia, KFP2: $15m; KFP3: $5.1m. South Korea, KFP2: $12.8m; KFP3: $11.4m) suggest that countries without China’s strong cultural stake could follow. A monster Chinese effort will be needed to keep Kung Fu Panda above the $600m mark earned globally by each of the first two parts. A strong hold in the US could see it hit a $700m+ high.
The great black hope
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Creed – Guardian film show review
Twelfth on the global chart, Creed has fallen short of Straight Outta Compton’s US take ($108.7m against $161.2m). But it is pulling ahead internationally ($51.7m against $40.3m), which may allow it to make up the difference. Both overseas tallies are encouraging for CGI-free dramas, and gently probe the received “wisdom” that black films don’t travel outside the US. Judging by the top territories for the likes of Compton and 12 Years a Slave – multicultural western countries such as the UK, France, Germany and Australia – then a market does exist. 12 Years a Slave, though, seems to have gone beyond this caucus, probably because of its clout as an Important Historical Document and its Oscars success. It over-performed in small territories such as Argentina ($1.2m) and Norway ($1.9m), and took blockbuster-sized grosses in emerging strongholds such as Mexico ($5.5m), on its way to a final $131.1m overseas.
Promisingly for Creed, it’s also showing signs of having reach beyond the expected locales; being part of the Rocky franchise, with Stallone a powerfully nostalgic presence at the heart of the film, must help. Italy ($5.7m) and Japan ($3.3m) currently feature in the top five territories, and in Mexico this week it opened higher than 12 Years a Slave ($1m against 681K). Italy finished third overseas for 2006’s Rocky Balboa, the only other Rocky film for which we have full data, so there might be some specific Italian-American factor there. As for the assumed international bias against black drama, though, it is perhaps less significant than the general difficulties of putting out mid-budget fare these days. The same goes for black films as for anything else: quality and astute branding can make all the difference.
Mid-term reports
Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Big Short – Guardian film show review
The Force Awakens is some $17m short of becoming the third film ever, after Titanic and Avatar, to cross the $2bn mark worldwide, but it is now flagging badly after a light-speed first month. Its $1.09bn overseas total can be read, in context, as a disappointment – slightly below what the far less celebrated Fast & Furious 7 took last year. The UK ($176.4m), China ($121.1m), Germany ($106.1m), France ($86.3m) and Japan ($83.3m) clock in as the top five territories. That’s a slight reshuffling of the order for the prequels: Japan dropping and an unsurprising new entry for China.
The credit-crunch drama The Big Short is showing great consistency – dropping just 5.6% on its seventh wide-release weekend in the US, and showing similar stamina elsewhere, its $28m budget should mean it winds up as one of the most profitable awards-contenders of the season. $102.7m worldwide and counting means it’s already several multiples in profit, unlike The Revenant – which has snatched a superlative $274.4m but is hobbled by a $135m spend.
One film that won’t be showing up at the Oscars is Michael Bay’s Clinton-baiting Libyan embassy flick 13 Hours, which is just commencing its overseas rollout. Taking $1.5m abroad, to put it 13th on the global rankings, it held up tolerably in south-east Asia this weekend. But a 320K UK debut is truly abject, and suggests Bay may be best off separating politics – or at least pretensions to seriousness – and work.
The Fraternal Order of Police have been giving Quentin Tarantino similar advice, but it’s doubtful the director’s stance on police brutality is why The Hateful Eight is struggling financially. $112.3m worldwide is easily his weakest showing since Reservoir Dogs, though the film may eventually surpass the second volume of Kill Bill. The daft decision to open against Star Wars, those middling reviews, and a general sense that the director is repeating himself seem to have taken their toll.
After The King’s Speech ($410.9m) and Les Misérables ($441.8m), fellow box-office heavy-slugger Tom Hooper is also checking his expectations with transsexual-pioneer drama The Danish Girl. He surely knew the subject matter was less commercial and, about halfway through its rollout, $34.5m worldwide confirms it. The Danish Girl also seems to be slipping behind The Revenant, The Big Short and Spotlight in the awards conversation, too.
Beyond Hollywood
There is an unusual Brazilian entry, at 17th on the global chart with $5m, for The Ten Commandments. Adapted from a local telenovela, the film puts a distinctly South American gloss on BC Nile-valley messianism. Three-million ticket pre-sales – five times what The Force Awakens managed in the country – are testament to the influence of evangelical Christianity there. But such a specialised-audience gig isn’t perhaps the overall boost that the Brazilian film industry could do with. For a country of its size, Brazil doesn’t produce as many films as it should, and it struggles to get more than one homegrowner in the annual top 10. But The Ten Commandments is still a local success story, and the likeliest contender to match the favela actioner Elite Squad 2’s $62.9m from 2010 – the current national record.
The Ten Commandments: film set to be biggest box office hit in Brazil history Read more
Italian odd-couple comedy L’Abbiamo Fatta Grossa, taking $3.8m for 18th place, has the unenviable task of following up January’s bureaucracy caper Quo Vado? – which, hovering near the $70m mark, almost certainly became the country’s highest grossing film ever, this weekend. The final non-Hollywood entry, at 21st globally with $3m, was the Chinese actioner Lost in the Pacific. Vincent Zhou’s film adds to the soon-to-be-exploding sub-genre of cheapo Chinese-US collaborations, alongside the likes of Nicolas Cage’s Outcast. The one-time Superman Brandon Routh and Stephen Chow collaborator Zhang Yuqi team up as passengers aboard a marooned airplane, in what looks like the cross-cultural orphan of Lost and Titanic. But probably not as successful.
The future
Another wan winter weekend looms, with no major new worldwide releases, then Chinese new year – and a barrage of blockbusting local titles – dropping a day later on 8 February. The Coen brothers’ studio-era Hollywood comedy Hail, Caesar! heads out in the US, ahead of a Berlin film-festival bow and limited European opening. With their starriest ensemble in a while, headed by their “Numbskull trilogy” collaborator George Clooney, it has the potential to do $150m-plus: the range occupied by 2008’s Burn After Reading. The brothers’ biggest ever grosses are still for the more dour, more manly likes of True Grit ($252.3m) and No Country for Old Men ($171.6m).
Lionsgate’s Pride and Pride and Zombies will open in a seemingly random selection of initial territories – the US, Brazil, Italy, Bulgaria and the Philippines – presumably chasing a slightly more female slant on the mashup-savvy demographic drawn to 2012’s Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter ($116.4m worldwide). And proving that the Brits can climb aboard the remake bandwagon as desperately as the Americans is Dad’s Army – pootling out on both sides of the Atlantic courtesy of Universal – with Bill Nighy and the Joneses Toby and Catherine-Zeta on antics duty. Next up: On the Buses with Noel Clarke and Jaime Winstone?

In its survey of films released in the US between 2002 and 2014, smoking was present in 60% of films rated PG-13 (parental guidance, particularly for children under 13) and in 25% of films rated PG or for all ages. Some films popular with older children and teenagers, such as Lord of the Rings (Gandalf and his pipe) or X-Men (Wolverine and his cigar) would be affected if they were released now, as would dozens of children’s classics familiar to generations.

Pinocchio, 1940
The high-tar benchmark of all kids’ smoking movies. Gepetto smokes, and so do lots of the baddies. Pinocchio reclines while smoking a cigar, but his ne’er-do-well friend Lampwick tells him he’s not doing it right. “Take a big drag. Like this.” The effect suggests many Disney animators were familiar with a bong. Educational.
Peter Pan, 1953
More cig-spiration for the nascent smoker. Captain Hook has a special cigar holder that allows him to smoke two at the same time and, in another scene, the sight of a Native American’s pipe being passed around the Darling children is the only thing that distracts you for a moment from the appalling racial stereotyping. Wendy manages to wrest the pipe from toddler Michael’s hands but John takes a puff and goes green. Peter Pan is clearly experienced and able to blow smoke “triangles”.

Coldplay|Beyoncé|India|Diplo|Iggy Azalea|blogposts,2016-02-01T21:33:38,guardian,Rashmee Kumar,"The legacy of colonial representation in music videos from Major Lazer, Iggy Azalea and now Coldplay extends beyond the cultural appropriation debate",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/01/coldplay-beyonce-hymn-for-the-weekend-cultural-appropriation-india,Coldplay: only the latest pop stars to misrepresent India as an exotic playground,en,culture|music,,"Within hours of releasing their new music video Hymn for the Weekend, Coldplay reignited the debate on cultural appropriation that for years has pestered ignorant white people everywhere. Shot in India, the video features the British band performing in Mumbai during the Holi festival while frontman Chris Martin rides in a rickshaw and goes to the cinema to watch a Bollywood film starring Beyoncé.
Some were quick to call out Beyoncé for wearing Indian clothes and jewelry while others found nothing offensive about the video. So let’s just settle this and move on: if cultural appropriation means that a privileged group adopts the symbols and practices of a marginalized one for profit or social capital, then yes, Coldplay’s video is committing cultural appropriation.
But it’s also more than that. Director Ben Mor sprayed the “essence of incredible India” onto his video, a diluted perfume invented by white, western creatives whenever they want some Indian inspiration. Under the western gaze, India is a lush, exotic land filled with dingy slums inhabited by pious, levitating holy men and lanky brown-skinned children who are always throwing colored powders at each other. This idealized India obscures the realities of a complex nation in favor of reductive tropes originally intended to preserve western hegemony. Coldplay’s myopic construction of India has been part of western representation since the colonial era, but in the past few years, the music industry has embraced it to make their videos more interesting.
The Hymn for the Weekend video cannot be brushed off as “just a video” – it is part of a system of representation that shapes how the west understands and engages with the world. The cultural theorist Stuart Hall wrote extensively about how representations become meaningful – and powerful – in relation to each other and to similar images throughout history. These tropes of colors and spirituality and poverty have been reproduced so often by western media to the point that they’ve become inherent to what India means in our collective imaginations. The vestiges of orientalism, an ideology originally deployed to justify and reinforce imperialist ambitions, now maintain a colonial logic that privileges the west over the rest.

Martin and his band are portrayed as dynamic, modern westerners who entrance the city with their formulaic pop song. They are not treated as outsiders but instead are integrated, if not put in the center, of the locals’ festivities. There is no suspicion, no resistance, and Coldplay partakes in the spectacle of daily life and ritual as if they’re entitled to do so. The orientalist dichotomies of modern/primitive, light/dark, rich/poor may not be as overt as they once were in colonial imagery, but these binaries still influence the way we think of the “other”.
Perhaps the most insidious aspect of western media’s infatuation with India is the lack of social and political context, namely in the careless conflation of India with Hinduism. Holy men in saffron robes, stone idols covered in garlands and multi-limbed gods have come to represent a whole country that is currently experiencing internal conflict stemming from Hindu nationalism. Those in power seek to define India’s politics and culture based on upper-caste Hindu doctrines that have been used to sanction violence against non-Hindus and people of lower castes. The link may seem tenuous, but the reproduction of benign, ahistorical Hindu images erases not only the multiplicity of religious practices, but stifles critical thinking about India’s social and political climate. Coldplay’s video romanticizes Hinduism to further exoticize India as a westerners’ paradise unsullied by harsh realities.

Now let’s talk about Beyoncé, who, along with Bollywood actor Sonam Kapoor, represents the desirable exotic woman. “Rani” Bey plays an alluring Bollywood star, wearing indigenous clothing and gesturing her henna-painted hands in front of a psychedelic background. I’ve purposely downplayed her involvement in the cultural appropriation debate for a reason. While Beyoncé’s appearance makes her complicit, her role in the video is little more than being an object to ogle. A black woman wearing South Asian markers of femininity must be distinguished from how white appropriation operates not only because of the politics of appropriation between people of color, but also the shared (and little discussed) history of cultural exchange between Africa and South Asia. Beyoncé and Kapoor, who does a two-second cameo as a nameless Eurocentric beauty, are seductive props rather than colonial propagators. But this doesn’t mean they are relieved of the responsibility to call out a legacy of representation that has recently become very profitable for the music industry.
Coldplay is just the latest popular band to shoot a music video that invokes India. In Major Lazer and DJ Snake’s video for Lean On, the electronic producers perform Bollywood-esque choreography in a palace as Danish singer MØ thrusts her pelvis awkwardly surrounded by dancing brown women. The video is the 15th most watched on YouTube with more than 1bn views. Diplo of Major Lazer has called India “some kind of special creature with one foot in history and one firmly in the future” with beauty that “humbled” him – and made him a lot of money.
Then there’s Iggy Azalea’s Bounce, inspired by her mother’s Indian friend’s wedding. The Australian rapper looks like she’s wearing an “Indian woman” Halloween costume in the jarring video that splices shots of a raucous party and an outdoor puja with the stoic faces of Indian men and children. And just when you think you’re done cringing, Azalea rides around Mumbai on an elephant dressed as a Hindu goddess with her ornate crown and gold bodysuit. Azalea drew accusations of cultural appropriation around the same time that Selena Gomez was criticized for wearing a bindi during her live performances of Come and Get It. But despite the backlash, both songs were still very commercially successful.
These music videos are perpetuating hackneyed fantasies of India as an exotic playground for rich white people to explore and exploit for cultural capital and economic gain. This is about more than calling out cultural appropriation when a white girl is wearing a bindi at the club – representations conceived through a white, western lens wield real power to reinforce the racial and colonial logics that undergird the way we think about non-western people, places and cultures. This is why the growing movement of South Asian self-representation is so vital. Mostly through social media, South Asian artists, activists and scholars are voicing their politics and lived experiences as a challenge enduring stereotypes. The time has finally come for Coldplay and other western artists to fall back and let us take it from here."

Cucumbers are from the gourd family – a family that includes melons, and that comes through in the flavour. As well as tasting distinctly melon-y, cucumbers can also be quite bitter. But most cucumbers don’t taste of much at all, in the best possible way. The flavour is simply fresh and a little green, with a lovely fragrance.
On the hottest summer day the cucumber is highly refreshing, especially in this cooling soup.
Cucumbers come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes. They can be yellow, round, orange, long, short and exceptionally bumpy, and are divided into three main groups: slicing, pickling and burpless. There are two ubiquitous varieties offered in conventional supermarkets: Lebanese and continental. You’ll struggle to find anything else, unless you grow them yourself or frequent farmer’s markets.

This time of year cucumber and zucchini vines are overproducing and sneakily growing giant in backyards. An easy plant to grow, it’s fun to experiment with unusual varieties. Grow a variety for pickling and another for eating fresh.
At the market avoid limp, soft, sunken or wrinkle-skinned cucumbers. They should be firm, brightly coloured and vibrant looking. Cucumbers are sensitive to heat so keep them refrigerated once purchased.
This soup should be served as the lightest, coolest lunch, with a crunchy loaf of ciabatta and a crisp glass of white wine alongside. Or for dinner it would make a delicious entree for a hot summer night. For these hot days and nights, it’s the perfect meal, with no need to turn the oven or even the stove hob on.
Cool cucumber, yoghurt and dill soup

3 cucumbers
1 tbsp creme fraiche
1 cup Greek-style yoghurt
1 spring onion, chopped roughly
2 tbsp dill, chopped finely, plus extra for garnish
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
Salt and pepper (preferably white or pink pepper) to taste
Olive oil, to drizzle
Crusty bread, to serve
To prepare the cucumbers for the soup, peel two cucumbers (leave one for garnish), halve lengthways and use light pressure to run a dessert spoon down the centre of the cucumbers to remove the seeds. After removing the seeds, roughly chop the cucumbers and set aside.
In a blender, place the cucumbers, creme fraiche, yoghurt and spring onion and blend until smooth (about 1 minute). There should be a slight texture to the mix.
Place the mix in the fridge for an hour to chill. When ready to serve, gently stir through dill, lemon juice and salt and pepper.
Garnish the soup with the remaining cucumber by running a fork along the whole cucumber to make impressions, then slice the cucumber and placing slices on top of each bowl. Sprinkle over a little extra dill. Drizzle with olive oil. Serve with crusty bread.
Serves four as an entree."

120g polenta (30p)
1 tsp sea salt (1p)
1 tsp muscovado sugar (1p)
½ tsp baking powder (2p)
A pinch of cayenne pepper (1p)
A pinch of ground cumin (1p)
A pinch of hot smoked paprika (1p)
¼ tsp chilli flakes (5p)
4 tbsp olive oil, plus extra (36p)
A large handful of coriander leaves (26p)
1 garlic clove, peeled (3p)
30g butter, melted and cooled (10p)
100ml whole milk (8p)
Juice of 1 lime (35p)
7 eggs, one beaten (98p)
2 large, ripe avocados, 1 cut into small cubes, 1 sliced (88p)
1 red onion, ½ diced and ½ sliced (22p)
1 beef tomato, diced (80p)

1 Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Grease an ovenproof dish and pop it in the oven until hot.
2 Put the polenta, salt, sugar, baking powder, spices and chilli flakes in a bowl and mix to combine.
3 Blitz the oil with the coriander and garlic or pound in a pestle and mortar.
4 In a separate bowl, whisk together the coriander-garlic oil, butter, milk, lime juice and egg. Pour the liquid ingredients into the polenta mixture and stir. Fold through the cubed avocado, diced red onion and tomato. Add a little water if you need to: you want quite a wet mix.
5 Remove the hot dish from the oven and pour the mixture in, topping with the sliced avocado and sliced onion.
6 Turn the oven down to 200C/400F/gas mark 6 and bake for 20–25 minutes, until puffed and golden. Remove and leave to cool.
7 Fry 4–6 eggs and serve with the bread and chilli sauce.
2 The weeknight supper: Fennel pasta bake with lemony breadcrumbs: £1.68 a head
This is a lighter, fresher take on macaroni cheese, with two of your five-a-day thrown into the mix. We serve it with a green salad on the side, which is included in the budget.
Sophie Missing and Caroline Craig, Cook columnists and food writers
Serves 4 (total £6.73)
500g penne (85p)
2 tbsp olive oil (19p)
1 fennel bulb, sliced (92p)
200g cheddar, grated (£2)
100ml half-fat creme fraiche (28p)
1 tbsp dijon mustard (7p)
335g cherry tomatoes, halved (90p)
Salt and black pepper (2p)
For the breadcrumb topping
2 tbsp olive oil (19p)
100g white breadcrumbs (5p)
Zest of 1 lemon (35p)
For the salad
Juice of 1 lemon
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil (9p)
1 tsp dijon mustard (2p)
2 little gem lettuce (80p)
1 First make the breadcrumbs. Put the oil in a small pan over a medium heat. Fry the breadcrumbs until golden. Add the lemon zest, some salt and fry for a minute more. Remove from the heat.
2 Bring a pot of salted water to the boil, add the pasta and cook for 2 minutes less than the recommended time. Drain, reserving some cooking water.
3 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Put the oil in a saucepan large enough to hold the cooked pasta. Fry the sliced fennel over a medium heat until soft and starting to brown. Add the creme fraiche and reduce the heat. When the creme fraiche is warm, add the grated cheese, leave to melt, and combine. Add the mustard and the tomatoes and stir again. Add the cooked pasta along with a splash or two of its cooking water (you want it pretty saucy) and mix until combined. Season to taste.
4 Spoon into a roasting dish and top with the lemony breadcrumbs. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes.
5 Meanwhile, put a little lemon juice, oil, mustard and a pinch of salt and pepper into a jam jar and shake to combine. Pour it over the lettuce leaves just after you’ve taken the pasta from the oven. Serve both immediately.
3 The super soup: Watercress, butternut squash and ginger soup: £1.58 a head
In winter, this soup hits the spot. The sweetness of the squash, the warmth of the ginger and the peppery watercress combine to make it the edible equivalent of a hot water bottle. If you have celeriac or swede lurking in the fridge, you could substitute them for the squash.

4 The weekend roast: Roast ham hock, swede and potato boulangère, buttered parsnips, parsley sauce: £1.49 a head
The best way to deal with cooking green (unsmoked) ham hocks is to slow-cook them overnight – it’s a fantastic smell to wake up to. I like to sneak a few small pieces of the rich meat into a pan with some fried eggs for breakfast, which is a way of making this cheap meal go even further.
Alex Bluett, chef and food writer
Serves 6 (total £8.99)
2 whole ham hocks (£5 from a butcher)
5 garlic cloves (15p)
2 white onions (36p)
Half a bunch of parsley (40p)
Half a swede, peeled (40p)
1kg baby potatoes, peeled (£1)
2 tbsp dijon mustard (14p)
2 tbsp brown sugar (10p)
1 tsp cumin (16p)
2 tbsp rapeseed oil (7p)
8 parsnips (£1)
50g butter (17p)
1 tbsp flour (2p)
Salt and black pepper (2p)
1 To prepare the hock, soak it in cold water for 4-5 hours before cooking. Change the water 4 times to remove excess salt. Put the hocks in a slow cooker before bedtime and pour over enough boiling water to just cover them. Add 2 of the garlic cloves, 1 white onion (halved) and the stalks from the parsley. Cover with the lid and leave until morning (about 8 hours). If you don’t have a slow cooker, the same result can be achieved in a very low oven, but make sure the lid is on tight so the stock doesn’t evaporate.
2 The next morning the hocks should be well cooked and falling off the bone. Remove them from the stock, put in a bowl and allow to cool so you can handle them. Pass the remaining stock through a sieve and reserve.
3 Once the hocks are cool, separate out the meat: hold the hock in one hand, pull all the bones out with the other, then gently release the meat from the skin and fat. Put the meat on a tray and put in the fridge to firm up a little.
4 To prepare the boulangère, with a mandolin or very sharp knife, slice the swede, potato and onion as thinly as possible. Finely chop the remaining 3 garlic cloves. Place all into a large bowl and add 500ml of the reserved pork stock. Give it a good mix and add a few grinds of black pepper.
5 In a 20x30cm deep roasting tray, evenly layer the mix into it, pouring over any juices left in the bowl.
6 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Roast the boulangère for 75 minutes.
7 Mix the dijon, sugar, cumin and rapeseed oil into a dressing and carefully coat the ham hock. Place on a baking tray and roast for 45 minutes.
8 While the boulangère and hock are cooking, prepare the parsnips and sauce. Cut the parsnips in half lengthways and blanche in boiling salted water for 8-9 minutes, or until just tender. Remove from the water and put cut-side down in a frying pan with half of the butter. Colour the parsnips on a low-medium heat.
9 For the sauce, put the remaining 25g of butter in a small pan and heat until just past foaming and releasing a nutty aroma. Add the flour, mix a little to cook it, then add 300ml of the reserved ham stock. Simmer to reduce and thicken a little. Chop the parsley finely, add to the sauce, and season.
10 Serve the boulangère and ham hock with the parsnips and sauce.
5 The family meal: Agrodolce sausage, squash and crispy sage tray bake: £1.28 a head
Sausages are a no brainer for low cost cooking and few can deny their tasty charms. If you’ve exhausted your normal repertoire of mash/gravy or pasta ragu then try this Italian-inspired tray bake. Golden roasted squash, a drizzle of vinegary syrup and crispy sage transform them from the everyday practical to downright sexy.

Serves 4-6 (total £7.70)
1 butternut squash (£1.39)
2 red peppers (£1.20)
3 red onions (66p)
8 pork sausages (£3.33)
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil (19p)
2 tbsp red wine vinegar (8p)
2 tbsp honey (11p)
2 garlic cloves, sliced thinly (6p)
15g fresh sage (60p)
1 tsp red chilli flakes, crushed (8p)
1 Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Use one large baking tray or two smaller ones. It’s important when making tray bakes to give the meat and vegetables space so they brown instead of steam.
2 Peel the squash, seed and cut into 4cm pieces. Trim, core and chop the red peppers into the same size. Peel the onions and cut into thick slices.
3 Put the veg and sausages on a tray. Drizzle with the oil and season well. Roast for 25 minutes and then remove from the oven. Sprinkle the vinegar, honey, garlic, sage leaves and chilli flakes and turn over with a spatula. Bake for another 6 minutes until sticky and golden. Serve immediately.
6 The party bites: Polpette di tonno: 24p a patty
Not unlike other meatball and croquette concoctions, this quintessentially Venetian cicchetto is all about transforming humble, inexpensive ingredients (stale bread, potato and tuna) into morsels that are far more tempting than the sum of their parts.
Valeria Necchio, food writer
Makes 18 (total £4.25)
300g floury potatoes (24p)
60g crustless white bread (3p)
60ml whole milk (5p)
200g tuna in oil, drained weight (£1.25)
2 tbsp parsley, chopped (36p)
1 large egg (23p)
25g anchovy fillets, chopped (83p)
80g breadcrumbs (4p)
Salt (2p)
Sunflower oil, for frying (£1.20)
1 Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water. Drain and cool slightly before peeling and mashing them with a fork.
2 Soak the bread in milk and let it sit for a couple of minutes. Squeeze out any excess liquid, then add to the potatoes and stir to combine.
3 Drain the tuna and flake it with a fork. Add to the mash together with the parsley, egg, anchovies, ¾ of the breadcrumbs and some salt. Stir until you have an even mixture. You can do this in a food processor or blender for a smoother result if you so wish. Rough is nice, too.
4 Grab a large spoonful of mixture and shape it into a patty. Roll it in breadcrumbs and put it on a tray lined with parchment. Repeat with the rest of the mixture.
5. Three-quarter fill a medium, high-edged frying pan with oil and put it on a medium-high heat. When it reaches 180C/350F, drop in a first batch of polpette and fry until deep golden, turning them to cook evenly. Drain with a slotted spoon and lay on kitchen paper. Repeat with the rest of the patties. Serve hot, sprinkled with salt.
7 The dinner for two: Egg, coconut and tamarind curry with cucumber and peanut salad: £1.80 a head
Many Keralans are lucky enough to have coconuts growing in their gardens. My friend Kirthi is one such person. Here is an incredibly thrifty meal that he prepared for me using ingredients almost entirely from his and his neighbours’ gardens. While our gardens may not be as luscious or tropical, only a handful of change and half an hour are needed to re-create a small slice of fresh, vibrant Kerala for lunch or dinner. When preparing this meal, I make the cucumber salad first, leaving all the flavours to get to know each other before getting the egg curry started. These two dishes are best served with some aromatic, hot basmati rice.
Meera Sodha, food writer
Serves 2 (total £3.60)
For the salad
30g peanuts, roasted, unsalted (20p)
1 cucumber, about 350g (45p)
2 tbsp fresh or desiccated coconut (22p)
½ green chilli, finely chopped (10p)
1 tsp salt (1p)
1 tbsp sugar (1p)
1 tbsp lemon juice (12p)
For the curry
3 tbsp rapeseed oil (11p)
2 red onions, finely sliced (44p)
4 eggs (64p)
4 garlic cloves, crushed (12p)
1 tsp tamarind paste (4p)
¾ level tsp chilli powder (10p)
½ tsp sugar (1p)
1 tsp salt (1p)
√ tsp ground turmeric (4p)
300ml coconut milk mixed with 100ml water (98p)
1 First make the salad. Coarsely grind the peanuts in a pestle and mortar and leave to one side.
2 Top and tail the cucumber, quarter lengthways, cut into 1cm slices then transfer to a serving bowl. To it add the coconut, chilli, salt, sugar and lemon juice. Stir to mix. It should be sweet, hot and sour all at once.
3 Adjust as you wish and fold in the crushed roasted peanuts. Set aside.
4 Now make the curry. Put the oil into a large, deep-sided frying pan on a medium heat and when it’s hot, add the onions. Fry them for 15 minutes or until caramelised.
5 While the onions are cooking, put the eggs into a large saucepan, cover generously with water and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down to a simmer and set a timer for exactly 6 minutes, for just-set hard-boiled eggs.
6 Add the garlic to the onions, stir well and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Add the tamarind paste, chilli powder, sugar, salt and turmeric, fry for a minute, then pour in the diluted coconut milk. Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn down to a simmer.
7 When the eggs have finished boiling, plunge them into cold water for a couple of minutes, then peel them and fold them into the coconut sauce, then take the pan off the heat.
8 The healthy dinner: chicken, chickpea and saffron stew: £1.38 a head
Using saffron in a budget recipe might sound crazy, but you will need just a quarter of the box and it will add a hint of luxury without breaking the bank. If you don’t like saffron, instead add a teaspoon of ground coriander when you sweat the vegetables. Don’t use an expensive chicken; find a boiling chicken, a tough old bird that produces the best-tasting bouillon in the world. Or ask your butcher for some (free) chicken carcasses or beef bones, with a little meat still clinging to them. This soup can feed a family of four or freezes beautifully and makes for a quick and delicious meal when you are short of time. The addition of garlicky vinegar is is in the vein of central Asian traditions, and it really works.

Serves 4 (total £5.50)
1 boiling chicken (£3 from the butcher)
2 onions, 1 whole, 1 diced (36p)
2 whole cloves (1p)
2 large potatoes, peeled (50p)
2 celery sticks, diced (20p)
1 carrot, grated (11p)
A small pinch of saffron (25p)
400g tin chickpeas (60p)
1 garlic clove (3p)
4 tbsp cider vinegar (17p)
20g coriander, chopped (25p)
Salt and black pepper (2p)
1 Put the chicken and a whole onion studded with cloves into a pot with 2 litres of cold water. Add a good pinch of salt and bring to the boil. Take off the scum with a spoon when it boils and turn down the heat to the lowest setting. Cook for 1½ hours or until the meat starts falling off the bone.
2 Add the whole potatoes to the stock.
3 Take a little fat off the top of the stock and put it in a medium frying pan. Add the diced onion and celery, and cook slowly until translucent. Add the carrots and cook for another 5 minutes, then the chickpeas and a little salt and pepper. Add the veg to the stock.
4 Grind the saffron with some salt in a pestle and mortar, add a little of the stock, then pour it back into the pot.
5 Grate the garlic and mix with the vinegar. Divide the potatoes between bowls and crush lightly. Add some broth, chicken and vegetables and sprinkle with coriander. Add some garlicky vinegar for an extra kick.
9 The gluten-free teatime treat: Lemon and thyme shortbreads: 9p a piece
Gluten-free baking needn’t break the bank. Using gram (chickpea) flour to make biscuits is much thriftier than buying a gluten-free flour or baking with ground nuts.
Eve O’Sullivan, Cook columnist and author
Makes 20-25 (total £2.16)
225g butter (77p)
125g caster sugar, plus extra (23p)
2 sprigs thyme, leaves only, chopped (10p)
Zest of 2 lemons (70p)
200g gram (chickpea) flour (35p)
A pinch of salt (1p)
1 With an electric whisk, beat the butter and sugar together until pale and creamy – around 2-3 minutes. Add the thyme leaves and lemon zest, and mix well.
2 Add the gram flour and salt, mix to incorporate, then knead with your hands for a couple of minutes, until you have a firm dough. Shape into a log, wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 1 hour.
3 Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Line a couple of baking trays with greaseproof paper.
4 Slice the log into discs around 5mm thick, put on the trays with plenty of space between each biscuit, scatter with a little extra sugar then bake for 18-20 minutes, until golden brown. Let them sit on the trays to firm up for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

165ml olive oil (86p)
1 garlic clove (3p)
100ml white wine (88p)
45ml red wine vinegar (10p)
1 Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3.
2 Start by making the red onion sauce. Soak the sultanas in a teacup of boiling water. Toast the pine nuts in the oven for 10 minutes until golden brown.
3 Slice the red onions very thinly and fry them gently in 60ml of the olive oil for 10 minutes. Then thinly slice the garlic, add to the onions and sweat for another 10 minutes. Add half the sultanas and half the pine nuts, the white wine and vinegar, and cook for 5 minutes.
4 Now make the stuffing. Remove any fennel fronds from the bulbs and roughly chop. Chop half of one fennel bulb and sweat in 15ml olive oil until soft. Allow to cool. Zest the lemon. Mix the fennel, half the fennel fronds, lemon zest, breadcrumbs and the remaining pine nuts and sultanas together. Add 30ml olive oil, the juice of half the lemon and season.
5 Turn up the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. To stuff the sardines, lay the fillets skin-side down on a board and lightly season. Place a teaspoon of filling at the head end and roll towards the tail. Secure with a cocktail stick. If some of the filling has fallen out during the rolling process, then pack it in from the sides.
6 Put the onion sauce into a baking dish and put the sardine rolls on top so that the tails are sticking up at a jaunty angle. Bake for 10 minutes.
7 Meanwhile, make the salad. Slice the remaining fennel using a mandolin or sharp knife across the whole bulb so you get a beautiful cross-section. Pick the parsley leaves and use whole.
8 Dress with the remaining half lemon, 60ml olive oil, salt and pepper.
9 When the sardines are cooked, sprinkle the remaining fennel fronds on top and serve with the salad."

Director at the Dulwich Picture Gallery, Ian Dejardin, invites you to share your visions of fire now
Nikolai Astrup (1880-1928) was the son of Christian Astrup, the Lutheran pastor of Alhus, a tiny community on the shores of beautiful Lake Jolster in western Norway. His childhood was marred by constant illness – the old parsonage was unhealthily damp – and by the religious strictness of his upbringing. Yet as an adult, his childhood memories were vivid and precious to him, informing much of his work.
One memory was particularly painful: of being prevented by his father from joining in the celebrations on Norway’s Midsummer Eve (23rd June). These consisted of enormous bonfires, lit at midnight, around which the local community let their hair down, dancing, drinking and courting. Christian knew a pagan survival when he saw it – and despite the attempted ‘christianisation’ of the festival, relating it to the feast of St John, there was more than a hint of fertility ritual to the bacchic goings-on. Nikolai and another child, a young girl from a neighbouring farm, were only allowed to stand and watch. Astrup made up for it later – it became one of his favourite motifs. He painted many versions; and produced innovative prints of the subject also. They are amongst his most famous and popular works in his native Norway, and there are ten of them in the current exhibition at Dulwich Picture Gallery.
In this, the biggest and most elaborate version of the motif that he painted, the main bonfire is answered by two others on the far mountains, each reflected in the lake below. Astrup has recorded how the geography has affected the great billows of smoke – on the distant fires, the smoke streams upward and outward, while from the main bonfire, it spills down and spreads out along the lake. Couples in their Sunday best dance in the foreground to the music of the old fiddler in the centre of the picture. He is playing the local Hardanger fiddle, a marvellous instrument with extra strings that reverberate to provide an echoing counterpoint to the folk melody. In the distance a group of villagers have gathered together to watch; one of the men strikes a dramatic pose, and the light from the fire projects a disturbing troll-like shadow against the rock behind. The woman in the right foreground seems left out and melancholy – like Astrup’s childhood self.
And at the centre is the fire – a marvellous explosion of oranges, blues and greens, laid on thickly with the brush, a virtuoso display of painterly brilliance, burning itself on the memory and making the centuries drop away, way, way beyond Astrup’s childhood to a pagan, Viking past.
So this month’s challenge, as part of The A to Z of Reader’s Art, is to create artworks that show your visions of fire.

1 Pulses
Nutritious, adaptable and wonderfully long-lasting, dried pulses are a steadfast presence in cookbook author and owner of Newton and Pott preserves Kylee Newton’s pantry. She buys them in bulk when travelling in Spain or Italy, but also rates London cornershops as an alternative source for 1kg bags, costing a couple of quid – which is four times cheaper than the packets of ready-to-eat lentils Merchant Gourmet do (£2 for 250g). Tinned pulses are similarly practical, with an infinitely more agreeable price tag – supermarket brands hover around the 60p mark. For Bristol-based chef and author of The Five O’Clock Apron Claire Thomson, preparing dried pulses gives markedly more flavourful results, but tinned beans (cannellini, borlotti, kidney, butter) are a sound storecupboard staple: “the stealth ingredient to boost protein, fibre and nutrients in soups, casseroles and bakes.” Her current favourite quick weeknight supper is the below riff on Mexican quesadillas.
Kylee Newton’s celeriac and beetroot pickle recipe | Cook residency Read more
Claire Thomson’s quick and easy quesadillas
Supper in 15 minutes: a meal that everyone enjoys, young and old, give or take additional chilli sauce.
Serves 4
1 large onion, finely diced
2 or 3 cloves garlic, finely sliced
2 tins beans, drained
1 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
Chipotle chilli paste (optional and to taste)
A small bunch of coriander, roughly chopped
Juice of 1 lime or 1/2 lemon
Salt, to taste
To assemble
Shop-bought tortilla wraps
Grated cheese
Extra chilli sauce
Salad ingredients
1 Fry the onion until soft and golden (10 mins), add the garlic and spices and fry for another couple of minutes. Add the beans and mix thoroughly into the onions, giving them a good mash with a potato masher or back of a wooden spoon. Add the chilli if using, lime juice, salt and coriander - check for seasoning.
2 Assemble the quesadilla by smothering one half of the wrap with the mashed bean mix and cover with enough grated cheese. Fold the wrap in half. Fry over a moderate heat in a dry frying pan until golden and the cheese within has melted.
3 Chop in half or 3rds and serve the quesadilla with extra chilli sauce and a salad - avocado is great.
2 Cooking chocolate
If food stylist Rosie Reynolds is making a cake, a frosting or something that calls for chocolate without it being the dominant flavour, she’ll plump for supermarket basic own-brand slabs: “It adds enough of a chocolate flavour, it’s a fraction of the price of more expensive brands, and it works really hard for you: you can overbeat it and it never splits. Dearer chocolate needs more careful handling.” At £6.50/kg, Sainsbury’s own-brand cooking chocolate is less than half the price of Green and Black’s (£16.70/kg). A favourite recipe of hers is the below tiffin cake.
Rosie Reynolds’s fruit and nut tiffin
Ingredients bought on the cheap will do just fine here: once they’re combined nobody will know you have been penny pinching – they’ll be too busy asking for a bit more.
Makes 16 squares
300g plain chocolate, broken into pieces
150g butter, cubed
75g golden syrup
300g rich tea biscuits
75g roasted hazelnuts, roughly chopped
100g plump sultanas
1 Line a 20 x 20cm brownie tin, or small deep baking tray with baking paper.
2 Put the chocolate, butter and syrup in a bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth and combined. Remove from the heat and set aside.
3 Put the biscuits into a large bowl and bash with the end of a rolling pin until roughly crushed- you are looking for some very fine crumbs and some more chunky ones. Add the chopped nuts and sultanas then pour over the melted chocolate. Stir until everything is fully combined.
4 Tip the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the surface with the back of a spoon. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill for at least 2 hours. Remove from the fridge 20 minutes before serving. Cut into squares and serve.
3 Seasonal produce
Farmers’ markets might seem more expensive than supermarkets, but opting for whatever is in season will actually work out more cost-effective, as New York-based chef Amy Chaplin points out. “When there’s an abundance of winter squash in the autumn,” she says, “you can get it very cheaply and store in a cool place for months. You can also cut it up and freeze it. Way cheaper than the supermarkets.”
Chef and food writer Jane Baxter can’t walk past a bargain in the rotting veg section of any establishment: “Vegetables can always be made into something or used to pad out a meat dish, so that you are eating 10% meat and 90% veg, which is what any non-vegetarian should be working towards.” Similarly, Guardian columnist Felicity Cloake gets all her fresh fruit and veg from her local market: “It’s usually super-ripe, which suits me, and I don’t mind a few bruises when you can get five avocados for less than the price of a single one at the supermarket.”
Readers' recipe swap: Tomatoes | Felicity Cloake Read more
Most simple produce, no matter how cheap, needs only good olive oil, some seasoning (salt, sugar, spices) and a hot oven to be made into something wonderful. Guardian Cook co-editor Mina Holland brings a glut of apples and pears – no matter how bashed about – back to life with sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon, while food blogger Skye McAlpine roasts persimmons, plums and grapes – pretty much whatever’s available – with honey, salt and sweet spices.
A similarly resourceful approach can be taken with seasonal veg: Mina says any potato can be made to sing with those basics and a sprig of rosemary, and food writer Eleonora Galasso can tackle even the cheapest tomato with a hint of caster sugar:
Eleonora Galasso’s tomato trick
Peel the tomatoes and cut each one in half, removing the seeds. Place the halves in a large bowl. Generously season with oil, salt, pepper and a hint of caster sugar. Mix gently. Line an oven tray with baking paper. Spread the tomato halves out on the tray, ensuring that they are well apart from each other. Place a few smashed garlic cloves on top and finish with a sprinkle of dried mint. Bake at 100C for 2 hours, turning the tomatoes halfway through the cooking. Serve on bruschetta bread or scattered atop a colourful salad and store any leftovers in a sterilized jar, covered with extra virgin olive oil.
4 Mushrooms
For London-based chef and owner of Brixton ramen joint Nanban Tim Anderson, cheaper varieties of certain veg are not to be overlooked, in terms of flavour and adaptability: “Cheap button mushrooms (Sainsbury’s, £4.50/kg) are really mushroomy, for lack of a better word. More expensive varieties of mushroom such as oyster, enoki, or beech (Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference speciality mushrooms, £10/kg) have their charms but none of them are as flavourful or as versatile as ordinary button mushrooms. And I’ve never understood the love many chefs have for wild varieties such as chanterelles, trumpets or girolles.”
5 Spices
For cookbook author Sabrina Ghayour, buying spices in larger, more inexpensive bags than the more costly supermarket pots makes most sense: “I don’t really have too many rules with spices, other than if it smells good, use it. I think there can be a lot of spice snobbery out there, which scares people into throwing older spices away, but it all depends on how you store them. Also, if people were less afraid of using them in abundance (as I do) then they would use them all the time and not have to worry too much about freshness. I buy my spices from the Tesco Asian import section where you get big bags for £1-£2. I have massive Kilner jars of my basic house spices, which I use a lot of (turmeric, cinnamon, coriander, cumin), and then smaller jars of things like sumac and cardamom.” Asian and Turkish supermarkets are another excellent place to get inexpensive spices in larger quantities: cinnamon sticks are sold in 50g bags at Turkish online supermarket Bakkalim for 89p – the same quantity in Sainsbury’s own-brand 13g jars would set you back £3.85 – that’s over four times dearer.

6 Broccoli
Similarly, Guardian Cook co-editor Nell Card always opts for bog-standard broccoli (Sainsbury’s loose broccoli, £1.40/kg) over more expensive varieties such as tenderstem (£8.75/kg) or purple sprouting: “It’s juicier than the woody PSB and I never know if my daughter is going to eat an entire head or spit it out and throw it on the floor, so I’m more than happy to buy a £1 bowl …”. Tim Anderson concurs, adding, “I also like the range of textures roasted broccoli gives you that other varieties don’t, because they cook too quickly and evenly.”
7 Honey
Skye McAlpine uses honey in much of her cooking, be it for roasting fruit or glazing meat, for baked goods or frozen treats, such as the semifreddo here below: “I find that where the honey is just a sweet accent to the dish, it is almost a waste to use the more expensive varieties. I just buy pots at the supermarket (Sainsbury’s Basics, £1/340g pot) and stock up, as I go through it in such extravagant quantities. I like to save special honey for special dishes, where it can really shine, and you can really indulge in the taste: honeycomb on buttery toast always holds a special place in my heart.”
Skye McAlpine’s honey, almond and ginger semifreddo
Serves 8-10
2 eggs
8 egg yolks
200g runny honey
600ml double cream
75g Chinese stem ginger in syrup
75g salted almonds
3 tbsp honey, a handful of crystallised ginger, a few whole almonds and a small bunch of fresh thyme, to decorate
1 Line a 22cm round cake tin with clingfilm. Pour the cream into a mixing bowl and whip until thick and stiff.
2 Set a clean heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, add the egg yolks, eggs and honey, and whisk vigorously until the mixture becomes thick and pale.
3 Gently fold the egg custard into the whipped cream. Roughly chop the stem ginger and the almonds and mix them in. Pour the mixture into the cake tin, cover with clingfilm and set in the freezer for 2-3 hours until solid. When you’re ready to serve the semifreddo, turn it out of the tin onto a plate and drizzle with golden honey, then decorate with almonds, crystallised ginger and sprigs of thyme, as you like.
8 Olive oil
When it comes to oil for cooking and drizzling, London-based chef Ben Tish isn’t fussy: “San Michele does a 750ml bottle of extra virgin, which I use for dressings and drizzling, at about £4-£4.50, and an olive oil I use for cooking that costs £3.50-£4. I think they’re both winners. The flavour’s quite robust – possibly a little unrefined – but it has bags of character. I think fish and meat lightly cooked in it tastes wonderful. The only time I’ll use something different is if I’m deep-frying or cooking at a really high temperature.”
9 Parmesan
Cook columnist and cookbook author Eve O’Sullivan opts for grana padano (£12.50/kg) whenever a recipe calls for parmesan (£13.50-£22.50/kg), “unless I’m buying a wedge to eat with pears as a dessert or it’s a truly special salad. You’ll be hard pushed to taste any difference when grating it over pasta.” Felicity suggests pecorino as an option. In her view, “good parmesan deserves appreciating on its own”.
10 Cooking wine
Felicity Cloake is happy to skimp on wine for cooking: “While I wouldn’t dare contradict the mantra that ‘if you wouldn’t drink it, don’t cook with it’, I get annoyed when recipes call for a specific sort of ruinously expensive, or hard-to-source wine: no doubt Italian peasants once cooked pears in barolo, but kicking off at £16 a bottle in my local supermarket, I won’t be. Instead I prefer to go for a less prestigious wine with similar qualities; in this case, a nebbiolo from the same region.
“In general, however, cooking tends to accentuate qualities such as tannins and acidity, so it’s safer to stick with softer, fruitier wines – supermarket own brands are pretty reliable these days, and generally come in at a shade under £5, plus you can pick them up with the other ingredients for the dish. Bonus: anything left over is still perfectly serviceable to drink at home, or at the tail end of a dinner party, when everyone’s stopped noticing what they’re pouring into their glass.
“A few recipes call for wines so specific there’s no easy substitute; coq au riesling is a good example. No other grape variety has the same thrilling acidity – but there’s no need to buy a bottle of the really pricey Alsatian stuff unless there’s enough left over for you to enjoy. Go for a cheaper German or new world bottle instead.”"
Food & drink|Cook on a budget|recipes,2016-02-01T10:56:47,guardian,Dale Berning Sawa,Here are 10 DIY ingredients that will make filling your fridge not only fun but considerably cheaper too,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/01/cheap-food-diy-homemade-ingredients,10 best foods to make from scratch and save money,en,lifestyle|food,,"1 Yoghurt
If we start from the perspective that milk, in terms of flavour, nutritional value and animal welfare, is one of the things you shouldn’t skimp on, it follows that your yoghurt should be made with good milk. Organic, natural yoghurt costs about £1.50 for 500g (Yeo Valley), and organic, Greek-style yoghurt £1.80 for 500g (Rachel’s). Making your own pot of 750g, using Claire Thompson’s Get Ahead recipe, involves buying a small one (50p, Yeo Valley) to use as a starter for 4 batches, and a litre of whole milk per batch (£1.10, Yeo Valley). The cost works out at 80p for 500g – not an inconsiderable saving. Go the extra mile to turn your batch into Greek style, which simply involves straining the yoghurt – your yield will be lower, proportional to how much whey you strain out, but the overall cost will still make it worth your while.
You save 14p per 100g for plain
2 Granola
The beauty of this breakfast staple is that it is endlessly adaptable to your pocket and your pantry. Using The Kitchn’s excellent ratio of 8 cups dry ingredients (5 of oats, 3 of nuts/seeds/dried fruit) to 1 cup wet ingredients (¼ oil, ¾ sweetener), something similar to Dorset Cereal’s honey granola (69p per 100g) would cost you about 50p per 100g. Look out for good deals at healthfood shops (the “penny sale” at Holland and Barrett, for example) and bulk-buy dried fruit and nuts from Asian and Turkish supermarkets or online wholesalers – and you can bring that cost down even further.
You save 19p per 100g

3 Rye bread
As any budding breadmaker will tell you, producing a loaf as good as a artisanal baker’s loaf is no mean feat. But rye bread is a good place to start: accessible, achievable, delicious and long-lasting. Tim Hayward’s quick recipe will take a few hours and cost £2.50 to achieve a loaf about 1.5kg in weight. By comparison, Ocado sells 1kg rye loaves for £5.50, which is already much cheaper than the prices you’ll see in independent bakeries for much smaller loaves.
You save 39p per 100g
4 Pesto
Pasta’s favoured outfit, generally a basil, pine nut and parmesan affair, can be made with pretty much any flavourful green leaf, oily nut and salty hard cheese, making it another thrifty basic. Provided you have olive oil, garlic, salt and lemon juice, there’s a pesto for every budget. The Kitchn’s winter greens pesto gives you an idea of how to adapt the original: make it as written, and your pesto will cost you 85p per 100g. Replace parmesan with grana padano or pecorino, walnuts with almonds or pumpkin seeds, and kale with veg tops (celery leaves, beetroot, carrot or turnip tops) and you can bring that cost down to 50p. Not to be sneezed at, when you consider that fresh pesto from deli counters can cost as much as £1.30 per 100g, and still cheaper than jars of the cheap long-life stuff cost 53p per 100g.
You save 80p per 100g for fresh tubs
5 Healthy snacks
Health snacks, energy bars – call them what you will, these are immensely overpriced and incredibly easy to make from scratch. The Kitchn have a 3-ingredient no-cook batch that takes minutes to make and can cost as little as you like. The basic ratio is 1 cup nuts, 1 cup dried fruit, 1 cup dates. So a walnut-apricot-date combo will cost £1 per 100g. If you fashion 12 x 40g orbs out of that, you’ll have your own version of the £2 Bounce Balls for a piddly 40p each. Of course, many store-bought snacks boast specialist ingredients that come with a hefty price tag – spirulina, ginseng, whey protein powder etc. But in including a dusting of superfoods, you’ll only be adding 30-40p to the cost of your entire batch. For a batch of macadamia and coconut balls, for example, based on this recipe, with the ingredients adapted slightly to mirror as far as possible those found the Macadamia and Coconut Bounce Ball, you’re looking at a cost of about £1.15 per 100g, compared to the shop-bought price of £5 per 100g. Definitely still worth your while.
You save £3.85 per 100g

6 Jams and curds
Supermarkets can supply you with really cheap condiments. Sainsbury’s Basics marmalade costs just 7p per 100g – a price that’s hard to beat, but it’s only got 20% fruit content. Homemade preserves are on another level in terms of flavour and they’re one of the economical cook’s go-to tools for making the most of a glut. What’s more, the cost of homemade jam can come in lower if you’re willing to while away an afternoon over an epic batch: 4kg of your basic three-fruit marmalade works out at 5p per 100g. By comparison, Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference, Tiptree and Bonne Maman marmalades all cost between 44p-62p per 100g. The trick is to stick to what’s in season.
The same is true of curds. You can buy Sainsbury’s Basics lemon or lime curd for as little as 7p and 18p per 100g respectively if you aren’t concerned about the quality of the eggs and butter involved. Or you could splash out on those luxury jars often found in farm shops (National Trust ginger curd with honey is £5 for 200g). If you make your own with organic, free-range eggs and organic butter it will cost you closer to 70p per 100g. Pass the toast.
You save over 50p per 100g on jams, and as much as £1.80 per 100g on curds
7 Nut milks and butters
Good-quality nut milks and butters are a surefire way to bust the budget, so buy raw ingredients in bulk and start blitzing. Green Kitchen Stories’s David and Luise make it with nuts (almonds, cashews or hazelnuts), water, a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of spices (vanilla, cardamom, cinnamon or cloves). Some sweeten theirs with a few dates. So, a litre of homemade almond milk will cost you £1.44 plus the 20p or so for whichever flavouring you go for. By comparison, Rude Health’s almond milk costs £2 a litre. Mixing it with seeds or oats will bring down your cost. Oatly plain organic oat milk costs £1.40 a litre; making your own with organic oats will cost little more than 20p.
Homemade almond butter made following GKS’s basic recipe will cost £1.02 per 100g; cashew butter £1.25 per 100g, give or take a few extra pennies if you like your nut butters salted. That’s half the cost of Meridian’s almond butter (£2.32 per 100g) and 40p less than their cashew butter (£1.65 per 100g). Granted, it will take you some years to recoup the cost of an awfully good food processor or high-speed blender, but still ...
You save at least 3p per 100ml of nut milk and £1.30 per 100g of almond butter

8 Pickles and ferments
Much like their sweet counterparts, savoury preserves, pickles, ferments and other condiments are an excellent way of maximising on the value of an overabundance of seasonal produce. You can make your own batch of River Cottage piccalilli for about 50p per 100g, when the posher jars on Ocado cost at least £1 per 100g. Homemade kimchi is another winner, at about 30p per 100g, compared to buying pots online at, say, Sous Chef (which is where you can buy the specialist Korean ingredients, by the way) for three times that amount. Check out Kylee Newton’s compendium, The Modern Preserver, for more recipes.
You save at least 50p per 100g
9 Flavoured oils and salts
This type of aromatic jar is usually the preserve of the overpriced deli, which is daft, given how easy they are to make. All you need is a bottle of good extra virgin olive oil, or a tub of good flaky salt, and your choice of flavouring. Take your pick from citrus peel, rosemary, sage, chilli flakes, basil, chives, garlic, ginger … The ratios for oil are 2 tbsp of flavouring to 250ml of oil, according to Epicurious, and 1 tsp of flavouring per 80g salt according to The Kitchn. So a 250ml bottle of oil infused with lemon peel will cost you £1.90; with garlic, £1.51 – compared to the shop-bought costs of £3.25 and £2.20, respectively. Similarly, making a 250g tub of smoked garlic powder-infused Maldon sea salt would come to less than £1 per 100g. Sainsbury’s sells Schwartz bottled garlic salt for £2.30 per 100g, while the Halen Mon chilli and roasted garlic sea salt on Ocado costs a whopping £5.50 per 100g.
You save at least 28p per 100ml on oils, £1.30 per 100g on salts
10 Dips
It’s tempting to sneak readymade pots of dips into your basket at the shops but the cost soon racks up. Hummus, guacamole and the like are super-easy and super-cheap to make from scratch. A batch of Felicity Cloake’s perfect hummus works out at around 30p per 100g, whereas your average shop-bought variety costs 43p per 100g. Similarly, Felicity’s perfect guacamole costs 47p per 100g, compared to Sainsbury’s £1 per 100g. Of course, the fun in making these yourself is that you can freestyle with fresh herbs, drizzles of flavoured oil, scatterings of nuts and seeds, harissa, caramelised onions and the like, all at a fraction of the cost of the primped-up shop-bought versions (Ocado’s range of special dips all hover between 70p-£1.50 per 100g).
You save at least 13p per 100g on hummus, 53p per 100g on guacamole

German discount supermarket Lidl is seeking to boost its environmental credentials by announcing it is taking steps to buy all its bananas from 100% sustainable sources this year.
It is switching by the end of 2016 to taking supplies only from farms that are either Rainforest Alliance – or Fairtrade Foundation certified.
Last year, sales of Fairtrade goods fell for the first time since the ethical trading scheme was founded 20 years ago as cash-strapped consumers tightened their belts, spending more at discount retailers such as Lidl and Aldi. Both stores have to date sold a limited range of Fairtrade products, but are under pressure to give the public wider choice.

The Fairtrade Foundation aims to protect farmers in developing countries by promising them a minimum price and financial support for community projects.
In November, Asda became the first UK supermarket to make a public commitment to sourcing Rainforest Alliance-certified bananas – for 93% of its supply – with the rest from Fairtrade.
Jon Covey, head of fresh produce buying at Lidl UK, said: “It is central to Lidl UK’s corporate social responsibility policies that the business always acts in an environmentally friendly and socially conscious way. This move is yet another milestone in Lidl UK’s ambition to provide its customers with sustainably sourced produce. We are extremely pleased to make this commitment to sourcing our bananas.”
This move follows Lidl’s decision to source 100% Rainforest Alliance-certified coffee for its deluxe range, with plans to certify the entire range of coffee products with either Rainforest Alliance or Fairtrade by 2017. It has been working with its supply partners with the aim of switching the majority of the retailer’s banana supply over to Rainforest Alliance- certified farms (88%) by the end of the year, with the remaining bananas coming from Fairtrade Foundation farms (12%).
In December, Lidl became the first British retailer to stock Marine Stewardship Council-certified lobster."

V&A|Museums|Trade unions|Privatisation|Public sector cuts|Public services policy|news,2016-02-01T16:15:47,guardian,Hannah Ellis-Petersen,Plan for commercial arm of museum to employ all new staff criticised by PCS union which says cultural public services are being dismantled,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/01/petition-protest-privatisation-v-and-a-staff-contracts-40000,"Petition against privatisation of new V&A staff contracts reaches 40,000",en,culture|art & design,,"Plan for commercial arm of museum to employ all new staff criticised by PCS union which says cultural public services are being dismantled
Tens of thousands of people are backing a campaign to halt the privatisation of all future staff contracts at the Victoria and Albert Museum.
Under plans announced at the beginning of this year, all new museum staff, from gallery assistants to curators, will be employed through V&A Enterprises Ltd – the commercial arm of the museum, which has private sector status.
Clara Paillard, president of the culture sector of the Public and Commercial Services Union, said it was an “alarming indicator that our cultural public services are being dismantled bit by bit”.
Paillard created an online petition calling on the museum to suspend the plans, which gained over 40,000 signatures in just four days.
The new system, which campaigners have branded “privatisation by the back door”, will have a significant impact on the redundancy protection, maternity leave and sick leave offered to all new staff. These new private contracts will also ensure staff no longer qualify for the civil service pension offered to public sector workers.
Paillard said: “These contracts are significantly worse in everything from pension provision, which will now be tied to investors and shareholders, to redundancy compensation, meaning it will be much easier to get rid of staff.”
She added the V&A had spoken to staff about the proposals before Christmas and said they would not negotiate with the unions because they were not recognised by V&A Enterprises Ltd.
The plans were justified as essential cost-cutting measures to the budget and pensions. However, Paillard pointed out that the plans were made before the autumn statement, when George Osborne announced there would be no further budget cuts for institutions such as the V&A. In light of this, she said it was “legitimate” that the proposals were reviewed.
She added: “We tried to have a proper dialogue and they refused. There is so much research showing the economic benefits of public investment in the culture sector. It is a public service and these are national collections and the danger of having more and more private sector operators in museums and galleries is quite worrying.
“Our hope is that the V&A will abandon this mad enterprise.”
Existing employees will not be affected by the plans. However, Paillard said the museum had a rapid turnover of staff and it would “not be long” until most working at the museum were on privatised contracts, which would have “long-term implications”.
The proposals by the V&A come after a recent dispute at the National Gallery over the privatisation of visitor and security services through the firm Securitas.
Members of the PCS union went on strike for 100 days over the plans, causing most of the gallery to shut down in August 2015, though the issue was resolved in October after the union agreed to a deal.
The Imperial War Museum also privatised its visitor services in December 2013, awarding the £10m contract to the Shield Group.
A spokeswoman for the V&A said: “The new terms provide the museum with the flexibility to offer competitive remuneration packages for new starters that better reflect the job markets that we are recruiting in.
“The V&A has informed and consulted its recognised trade unions on these developments.”"

It took the wild artistic optimism of a Hungarian refugee to liven up the postwar sea-of-brown in British homes",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/01/tibor-reich-the-whitworth-manchester-interiors-britain-designer-bright-colour,"Him indoors: Tibor Reich, the designer who brightened up Britain forever",en,culture|art & design,,"We take colour for granted in our homes. From brightly patterned wallpaper and ostentatious piles of scatter cushions to our new-found fondness for minimalist greys and pastels, our interiors have become a reflection of ourselves. Yet, it was not always this way – a new exhibition at The Whitworth in Manchester celebrates the designer who shook up the austere living rooms of postwar British homes.
Tibor Reich, who was born into a Jewish family in Budapest in 1916, escaped Nazi-occupied Vienna for Leeds in 1937, becoming a pioneering interior designer of 1950s and 60s Britain. It was a Reich designed woollen fabric chosen by a young Queen Elizabeth as her wedding present in 1947, and in a career that lasted three decades, his vibrant, deeply textured designs would decorate the interiors of royal palaces, embassies, 10 Downing Street and even the first Concorde.
Reich’s greatest impact however was on the everyday British home. This – and the pioneering techniques he brought to the British textile industry – form the basis of the Manchester show, which marks the centenary of his birth. Much of the material on display was collated from Reich’s vast archives by his grandson, Sam Reich, almost 40 years after the last roll of Tibor fabric was made.

“Right from the beginning, Tibor was much more daring in his use of colour than most British designers working at the time,” says Sam Reich. “In Budapest, his grandfather had set up a spinning mill making all the braids and ribbons for the Hungarian national costume, so he grew up around all the bright pinks and blues and metallic decorations of the uniforms. It was there he first fell in love with colour.”
The British public, more used to the greys and browns imposed on them by war rationing, embraced this modern vision of living – championed by Reich and fellow designers of the time such as Lucienne Day. The real turning point was a 1954 exhibition, An Adventure With Colour, which showcased bold Tibor designs including a “risque” siamese pink paired with black or dark green. The exhibition toured the country, finishing up at Liberty’s in London, and attracted more than 250,000 people.
“Tibor believed that colour was an energy, that it was optimistic and something more people should incorporate into their houses,” says his grandson. “It was a reflection of his personality – that things should be exciting rather than drab, boring and austere. There were several designers at the time championing colour in interior design, but Tibor was certainly the most shocking.”
Much of Reich’s success came from his use of the natural world as inspiration for his patterns and textiles. Avoiding the big industrial cities, he instead set up his mill just outside Stratford-upon-Avon, so as to be immersed in rural surroundings. An avid artist and photographer, Reich obsessively sketched the scenery, trees and foliage that formed the basis of some of his most popular designs.

As a Hungarian national living in post-war Britain, Reich struggled to be accepted and for the first two years was not allowed to be named director of his own company. He became determined to help other immigrants, and made a point of hiring and training eastern Europeans, interned at a nearby prisoner-of-war camp, to work in his mill.
Filled with what his grandson described as a “restless artistic energy”, Reich also turned his hand to a range of ceramics inspired by Hungarian folk art. He began making them in his own garden, but they became so popular they were later mass produced by Denby.

Reich continued designing textiles into the late 1970s, but struggled to compete with cheap foreign labour and budget, mass-produced materials in the shops. A flood brought the factory to a standstill and in 1977, Reich decided to retire and close the company. Yet he still continued to sketch every day, and on his death left around 15,000 drawings, as well as Europe’s largest model car collection and a vast stamp collection, all part of his vast archive.
As well as the Whitworth exhibition, Sam Reich is relaunching the Tibor Reich textile company in 2016 to reproduce some of his grandfather’s designs and develop new design talent. It was, he said, a fitting tribute to Reich, who was “an artist who could [turn] his hand to anything”.
“Tibor wasn’t someone who was interested in mass producing cheap, simple fabrics. He really believed that good design could change lives and that the fabrics you had in your house would be there to bring you joy.”"

It’s about how you get taught. My grandfather was a Jew from Poland who trained as a lawyer and ended up in Jamaica as an undertaker. He was a very intelligent man and took me under his wing: made me listen to Ella Fitzgerald and read Dickens. He used to quote Shakespeare when he was shaving – “Out, damned spot!” I was brought up with Shakespeare as a friend, and my grandfather taught me to take the words from the page to the stage.

At Talawa theatre company, our policy was to give black actors work they weren’t being offered – and nobody was offering them the chance to do Shakespeare. Norman Beaton was best known for the sitcom Desmond’s, but he was an extraordinary actor. His Krapp’s Last Tape was so moving – the best I’ve ever seen. We were in Pizza Hut when I agreed he should play Lear, and he almost fell off his stool. Norman thought of Lear as something like the head of a credit union. Black people tend to put their faith in credit unions rather than banks, so Lear would be king of the money.
Norman had learned all the lines, but just before rehearsal he got sick. I went home and locked myself away. We had to continue – we already had money from the Arts Council – but we couldn’t do Norman’s idea. I had to reconfigure the production in just two and a half weeks. It was imagist and futuristic – Ellen Cairns, our fantastic designer, created a stage like a disk, with black leather costumes and a perspex throne that looked like glass.

Ben Thomas was already in the cast. I told him, “Donald Wolfit played Lear at 40. You’re 39. You’re going to do it!” He’s a brave, excellent actor – but was also a tall, strapping man in his prime. To make sense of it, we gave the king a heart condition, always reaching for his pills. Black people are prone to heart conditions, and also worry about madness – the rates of schizophrenia are far higher in the black population. The psychiatrist Aggrey Burke often used King Lear in lectures to demonstrate aspects of society – I was humbled by that.
It’s not my favourite play. King Lear is a terrible bloke! What he says to his daughters at the beginning is absolutely shocking. Goneril and Regan (Lolita Chakrabarti and Cathy Tyson) aren’t bitches, and Cordelia (Diane Parish), the youngest, is idealistic and fed up with his lies. David Harewood, who played Edmund, hadn’t done any Shakespeare before – he was so scared. He would ride his bike up and down the pavement outside the rehearsal rooms to try and get the iambic rhythm.
Mona Hammond played the Fool as a schizophrenic – even her makeup was split down the middle. At a workshop at the National, Peter Brook asked me, “When do you know you’ve succeeded?” I replied, “When I forget I know the actor. Mona is a dear friend of mine – I used to look after her baby son. But I stood at the back one night, and forgot I knew her. I was just watching the Fool.” For me, that’s a test of how you’ve allowed the play to belong to the actors.

People said things about the production that they’d never say today. People asked, how can you cast a black Edmund – he’s a bad role model for all the naughty boys in Brixton! Some critics hated it – and when I was on Desert Island Discs, Sue Lawley asked me about casting these Shakespearean – read “white” – roles and said, “What gives you permission to do that?” I said, “Darling, that question shows your lack of imagination.” They cut that part of the interview …
Norman came with me to see the production before he died. We slipped in at the back and I held his hand. He was weeping – and at the interval, he said, “I can’t see the end. This is my play. I wanted before I died to do Lear.”"
West End|The Observer|Theatre|Friends|Alcoholism|features,2016-02-01T07:18:06,guardian,Sarah Hughes,The cast of Friends has reunited – except for Matthew Perry. He is in London embarking on the next chapter of his life,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/31/matthew-perry-end-of-longing,Matthew Perry: the one where Chandler writes a West End play,en,culture|stage,,"The cast of Friends has reunited – except for Matthew Perry. He is in London embarking on the next chapter of his life
Matthew Perry will make his playwriting debut when The End of Longing opens in London’s West End on Tuesday night. Described as “a hilarious and dark comedy about four people searching for meaning in their 40s”, the play, in which Perry will also play a lead acting role, marks the latest step in his quest to build a career after Friends.
Yet even as he spent last week doing the rounds of radio shows and daytime television to talk about the play and why he wrote it, the conversation was once again dominated by his time on the most popular sitcom of the 90s.
“Matthew Perry can’t remember three years of Friends,” blared headlines, after he admitted that his drug and drink addiction was so problematic towards the end of the decade that he had little or no recollection of seasons three to six.
There was also the small matter of the “Friends Reunion”, a gathering in Los Angeles to honour television producer James Burrows featuring contributions from all of the Friends cast, including Perry (who taped his introduction from London), which will air on US network NBC on 21 February. No sooner had the Burrows tribute been announced than the internet was once again abuzz with speculation about a Friends film or reunion special.
While co-creator Marta Kauffman quickly shot down the idea, telling the US press “there will never be a reunion”, Perry sounded less final, remarking on Radio 2’s Chris Evans Breakfast Show that: “I think the actors would actually be open to it, I do. I think we’d be open to doing something, some kind of TV special, I dunno about a movie. It’s kind of tough because we ended on such a high note that we don’t want to ruin it. So we’d want to be very careful, but I think the cast would be open to doing something at some point.”

As a statement it was notable for being the most relaxed Perry has sounded about his most famous role for some time. In the years after Friends ended he was clearly desperate to put clear water between him and the character he played, the sarcastic, twitchy Chandler Bing. “People come up to me every day and say, ‘Hey Chandler!’ I don’t respond to it,” he said in an interview in 2014. “If somebody says, ‘Hi Matthew, I love your work’, that’s one thing. But if somebody goes ‘Yo, Chandler’, I don’t like that. I’m tired of it. I’m not Chandler.”
In truth Perry has always had a complicated relationship with stardom. Born in Williamstown, Massachusetts, his parents divorced when he was a baby and his Canadian mother, a former press aide to the Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, returned to Ottawa with her son. Initially determined to become a tennis pro, Perry switched to acting after moving to Los Angeles to live with his father at 15. “I was nationally ranked in Canada when I was 13 but then I moved to Los Angeles and everyone in LA just killed me,” he told Men’s Health magazine in 2012. “I soon realised I wouldn’t be playing tennis for a living so I went for acting instead.”
A series of minor and supporting roles in sitcoms and movies swiftly followed – when he was cast in Friends in 1994, he was the youngest member of the ensemble at 24. Open about his desire to become a star – “There was steam coming out of my ears, I wanted to be famous so badly,” he told the New York Times in 2002. “You want the attention, you want the bucks, and you want the best seat in the restaurant. I didn’t think what the repercussions would be” – he was also singularly ill-equipped to deal with its pressures.
Both intensely private and desperate for attention, he had no idea how to cope with the demands of fame, admitting in an early interview that even as he landed the big bucks in Friends – at the show’s height the stars were earning $1m an episode – he could think of nothing to spend his money on “except a new couch”. “When [stardom] happens it’s kind of like Disneyland for a while,” he said. “For me it lasted about eight months, this feeling of ‘I’ve made it, I’m thrilled, there’s no problem in the world’. And then you realise that it doesn’t accomplish anything, it’s certainly not filling any holes in your life.”
It wasn’t long before his demons surfaced. Always obsessive – as a junior tennis player he practised for 10 hours a day and brought the same detail to his comic performances, working on his timing and delivery again and again – Perry, who first drank at 13, soon found himself using alcohol to relax. A jet-ski accident in 1997 led to a prolonged addiction to the painkiller Vicodin.
His first stint in rehab came soon after and there were repeated attempts to get clean. In May 2000 he was hospitalised with pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas often linked to heavy alcohol abuse. In 2001 he entered rehab again, undergoing treatment for addiction to Vicodin, methadone, amphetamines and alcohol. It was the latter addiction that drove the rest – he admitted in an interview with Larry King that he took the downers “mostly just not to drink as much as I was” and, while he has repeatedly stressed that he never drank on set, he also notes: “I went to work in extreme cases of hangover.”
He quit drinking in 2001 and has subsequently stayed clean – although in 2011 he checked back into rehab as a way of preventing a relapse, remarking sardonically to the US press: “I’m making plans to go away for a month to focus on my sobriety and to continue my life in recovery. Please enjoy making fun of me on the world wide web.”
As that last statement suggests, there’s a brittleness to Perry. For every joke about not remembering episodes of Friends – “I was a little out of it at the time,” he told Evans – or playing a drunk in The End of Longing being “a slightly exaggerated form of myself”, there’s a sober admission that he continues to struggle with life. “You can’t have a drug problem for 30 years and then expect to have it solved in 28 days,” he said in a video for the Hollywood Reporter released on his 46th birthday last year. “I’m a pretty private person but I was on a TV show that 30 million people were watching. It was so public what was happening to me.”
He has subsequently found a measure of peace working with fellow addicts. Having spent much of his early 30s in and out of sober-living halfway houses, he allowed his Malibu home to be used as a similar facility for a number of years and continues to advocate for rehabilitation over jail, memorably squaring up to Peter Hitchens on Newsnight in 2013 on the subject of drug addiction. “If an alcoholic comes up to me and says, ‘Will you help me stop drinking?’ I will say, ‘Yes, I know how to do that’,” he remarked in a recent US TV interview.

Yet if his emotional demons are in abeyance, post-Friends career stability continues to elude him. Widely considered the most naturally talented of the Friends, he has been unlucky with his follow-up roles. Excellent in Aaron Sorkin’s uneven Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, he was solid in sports sitcom Mr Sunshine, grief comedy Go On and an ill-conceived reboot of The Odd Couple, yet his best post-Friends performances have been in guest roles, in everything from The West Wing to The Good Wife.
There remains the thought that he lacks the charisma to play a leading man and may be most comfortable stealing the show from the sidelines.
Having dreamed of stardom all his life – “If I hadn’t had the experience of being famous I would have searched for it my whole life. I would have just gone on and on trying to find it,” he told the New York Times in 2002 – only to struggle with it when it arrived, he now seems to have made peace with the show that made him. He even goes so far as to describe The End of Longing as “a dark version of Friends”.
Yet the obsessive streak that both fuelled and failed him has never quite died: and so it is that just as he seems finally free of fame’s burdens, Perry has decided on his most risky undertaking yet. Come Tuesday the spotlight will be turned not just on his acting but on the play he has written. Can this likeable but fragile man cope with the intensity of nightly performances on a West End stage coupled with reviews of his work? A generation raised on his affable charm and sharp way with a one-liner will be hoping the answer is yes.

Adrian Lester returns to the role of Hamlet and Roger Allam takes on King Lear for the first time in a major new series of Guardian videos, launched today. Shakespeare Solos, a project to mark the 400th anniversary of the playwright’s death, brings together a lineup of outstanding actors who each perform a key speech from the plays. The first six videos also star Eileen Atkins, Ayesha Dharker, Joanna Vanderham and David Morrissey.
Lester gained acclaim when he played Hamlet for director Peter Brook in a stripped-back production at the Bouffes du Nord theatre in Paris in 2000 and the Young Vic in London the following year. For Shakespeare Solos, he delivers the “to be or not to be” soliloquy which the actor describes as “Shakespeare at his best”. Lester said he hardly had to relearn the soliloquy before filming the video as he and Brook had spent “so long getting it in the blood” for the stage production. Lester, who is currently appearing in Red Velvet at the Garrick theatre in London, said the speech captures the “quiet, profound nature” of Hamlet’s despair and that it is also “an intellectual outpouring, because Hamlet is a very bookish person. But at the heart of it is a very fundamental question about whether he should live or die.”

For Lester, playing Shakespeare on camera was “quite liberating, because the complexity of all of those thoughts can be brought right down for the screen. You don’t have to do anything but believe what you’re saying … rather than turning front and centre [on stage] and firing it down to the audience. The complexity of thought has a delicacy to it. You have to be careful about it – at times, it can be slightly destroyed when you’re concentrating on technically making sure the audience can hear you and delivering the kind of bombast required.”

While Lester’s solo found him returning to a familiar speech, Roger Allam’s gave him the opportunity to play a part he has long desired a crack at: King Lear, which is often described as a mountain of a role. One stormy night, when he was playing Falstaff at Shakespeare’s Globe in London in 2010, Allam surprised audiences by suddenly going into Lear’s “Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks” speech. He performs those lines for Shakespeare Solos.

The videos, directed by Dan Susman, have been mostly shot at the Guardian’s multimedia studio but Atkins was filmed on location at a restaurant for her performance as Emilia from Othello. We are put in Desdemona’s place as Atkins intimately addresses the camera: “But I do think it is their husbands’ faults if wives do fall.” Emilia is one of the characters Atkins is currently playing in her one-woman show at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse.

Joanna Vanderham, who played Desdemona for the RSC last year, chose lines from the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet for her solo, which was recorded by candlelight. “I auditioned for Juliet at high school and I missed out,” laughs the star of the BBC1 drama The Paradise, who has recently appeared in the West End in The Dazzle. “Romeo and Juliet is such a beautiful play. The strength of their love is so admirable. It took me a while to get my head around that depth of love and to accept that it can exist. In her speech you can feel how many different thoughts she’s got going at one time. It’s quite incredible how Shakespeare can turn his hand to any age, any gender, and capture them absolutely perfectly. It is a 13-year-old girl’s mind: all these different thoughts that come out in a stream.”

David Morrissey, who was a member of the RSC in the late 1980s and is currently starring in Hangmen in the West End, was cast as Richard III for his solo and delivers the scheming Richard’s opening speech. While the majority of the videos offer a one-off opportunity to see these actors try out new roles, Ayesha Dharker’s solo also offers a taste of one of this year’s most anticipated Shakespeare productions. She recorded Titania’s “these are the forgeries of jealousy” speech from A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Dharker takes up the role of Titania on stage in Stratford later this month. That production will tour the UK from March to June, with local amateur companies joining the RSC’s actors on stage."

No one wants to hear about your dreams. Their eyes will glaze over when you tell them you only got three hours’ sleep because of that “weird” one about sharing a house with the actor Max von Sydow where you communicated through a gap in a bookcase. Their ears may prick up, however, if you have one of the more fascinating parasomnias. Bruxism (tooth-grinding) may not make the cut, but sleep paralysis, sleep walking and night terrors are fascinating, largely because we really don’t know what causes them or what purpose they serve, not to mention the bafflement and horror they bring with them.
As a species, we have been attempting to unravel the tangled mysteries of our nocturnal habits since long before Freud turned his attention to the symbolism of our dreams. We have all woken from terrifying nightmares, but night terrors are a level beyond that and, uniquely, the sufferer often wakes with little or no recollection of what disturbed their rest.
Putting sleep myths to bed: experts answer the questions that keep you awake at night Read more
Unlike sleep paralysis, which often persists into adulthood, night terrors are largely confined to children between three and eight years old (prevalence has been estimated at about 6% of children and 1-2% adults). Symptoms typically include piercing screaming and violent thrashing of the bed, giving the air of someone in a terrible panic. It’s not just covers getting tossed and pillows being disturbed – the howls of terror can be primeval, the sweat running freely. It’s like the sufferer has gone feral. In most cases, their eyes will be open but they are, in fact, asleep.
For a parent or, in the unusual cases of night terrors in adults, a partner, coping can be a challenge. Chances are, you are also being wrenched from sleep, and you will be attempting to calm down someone who appears to be re-enacting scenes from The Exorcist.
There are various triggers that increase the likelihood of a night terror episode. These range from extreme tiredness, sleeping in unfamiliar surroundings and external stimuli such as noise and lights to fever, stress and a full bladder. But even with all these factors eliminated, terrors can still occur, and the wide-eyed, sweating, manic individual experiencing them will be a test of anyone’s coping skills.

It is advised that you do not try to wake someone when they are experiencing night terrors. It is highly likely that if you do, they will be so disoriented that they won’t recognise you, which will further increase their stress and anxiety. It may run against your parenting or loving instincts, especially when the key signifier of someone enduring a night terror is their inconsolability, but you should not try to console them. Instead, simply wait until the terrors subside, monitoring the sufferer to ensure they don’t harm themselves if they get out of bed, as often happens. Once the episode is over, you should wake them, to break their sleep pattern before they return to a heavy sleep. Encourage them to use the toilet, in case it is a full bladder that is acting as the trigger.
The morning will seem bizarre. You will have been through a long, dark night of the soul; they will probably be totally unaware that anything happened. Unaware that, as lab tests have shown, they have experienced increased muscle tone, reddening of the skin, dilated pupils, a heart rate that may have doubled and spikes of electrical activity in the brain. This is because night terrors tend to occur during non-REM sleep, and dreams during this period are less likely to include vivid imagery and emotions than REM sleep.
For children who suffer night terrors, there is almost always a happy ending – it dissipates as they move towards adolescence, and the only way it will have affected their lives materially is through the introduction of poor or erratic sleep patterns.
For the small minority of adults who suffer night terrors, there are different considerations. The physically violent movements of fully grown adults are obviously more of a danger to the person they share their bed with than a child’s – and they are also more prone to injure themselves and be able to leave the house while asleep.
Diet and stress are more important triggers for adults, but night terrors can also signify other issues. Studies have shown a correlation between episodes and other psychiatric symptoms. In fact, the latter were present in most adult sufferers. Another difference is that an adult is much more likely to have vivid memories of what happened during sleep than a child.
There is no magic cure. If you suffer from night terrors, you can attempt to change your sleep patterns, remove stress from your life and empty your bladder before you retire, but the condition can persist. We are only at the beginning of our understanding."

Employers need to tackle this, both for work performance and for people like me",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/loneliness-at-work-introvert-sadness-bereft-in-bustling-office,Workplace loneliness is a real problem. For 45 hours a week I feel isolated,en,opinion,,"It was an average morning. I was up at seven, helped get the kids their breakfast and hustled them into being ready for school. They left, and I went back upstairs to get dressed for work. But that’s not what I did. I got back into bed, and lay there for another hour, staring at the ceiling.
I work in a large organisation, surrounded by clever, funny, like-minded people. I’m sure there are some tossers – there are everywhere, aren’t there? – but I’ve never met them. I have the unalloyed privilege of working in an area whose subject matter fascinates me, and which I spend a good chunk of my free time studying and talking about. My job is a fulfilment of the ambition I had when I left university 25 years ago, and everything should be rosy. So why did I go back to bed that morning?
The age of loneliness is killing us | George Monbiot Read more
I did it because I am lonely at work, and staring at the ceiling for an hour was about as much as I could face. I am a different generation to my immediate colleagues, and I’m their manager. They don’t want to hear about my troubles; they don’t want me being the embarrassing old bloke inveigling my way into their 6pm drinks. And I’m shy and introverted, too (that might come as a surprise to those who know me casually, who doubtless think of me as loud and bumptious, but you don’t need to be a wallflower to be an introvert), so the idea of trying to forge new relationships with people is fraught with horror, even if I know it would be for my own good.
The result is that I feel almost entirely alone at work. There’s no one at the place where I spend much of my waking life to whom I can turn when I want to confide my fears, to moan about the upper echelons, to worry away about what’s happening at home.
But who cares, really? I get paid well to do something I enjoy, and still I’m skiving for an hour first thing in the morning. I should just man up, shouldn’t I? It’s not like I’m homeless or sweeping up litter or any of the other straw men brought up whenever someone in an apparently cushy number has the temerity to say they’re unhappy.
Except it’s not that simple. Workplace loneliness is a real problem, one which is being increasingly recognised, but it’s one we don’t want to talk about – who wants to be the person who opens themselves up to derision by announcing their feeling of isolation to their colleagues?
For 45 or 50 hours every week, I feel isolated
An academic study in 2011, by professors from California State University and Wharton School of Business, explained why workplace loneliness matters. After surveying a sample of 672 workers, Hakan Ozcelik and Sigal Barsade concluded that loneliness at work has a “significant influence on employee work performance, both in direct tasks, as well as employee team member and team role effectiveness rated by both the employee’s work unit members and supervisor”. Admitting to being lonely only made things worse, because the knowledge of another’s disaffection “provided stronger and more negative cues for the co-workers about the overall quality of their relationship with the employee”. Which makes them even lonelier.
The polling organisation Gallup offers employers 12 questions that will test an employee’s engagement at work. One of them is “Do you have a best friend at work?” As Steven Miranda of Cornell University told Fortune in 2014, it all counts to a company’s overall performance because without friends, without a feeling of social connection at work, people make less “discretionary effort” – the bits of work that lift an employee past being the contributor of the bare minimum. “When you walk into the office every morning, you’re either thinking, ‘I’m pumped about being here. I’m going to get so much done,’ or ‘How quickly can 5 o’clock come?’” he told Fortune. “I would bet my bottom dollar that people who are lonely and disengaged at work deliver far less discretionary effort than people who have a support system or a go-to person [at work].”
But how prevalent is loneliness at work? In August 2014 Relate released a study suggesting that 42% of people do not have a close friend at work. Not all of them are going to be lonely, of course, but a chunk of them are. And given that the same survey found that “we’re almost as likely to have daily contact with our colleagues (62%) as we are with our children (64%)”, then it’s evident that what happens at work has an impact on our wider attitudes to life.
In my own case, I used to have two very close friends at work – the kind who you know, after one conversation, you have an important bond with. One was my lunchtime friend – our relationship fulfilled the rules of the “office spouse”. The other was my pint-after-work friend. Both were crucial, I realised, to my happiness at work. Both have now left not just the company, but also the town. And so these days I sit alone in the canteen at lunchtime, reading the paper, and I never go to the pub after work. There are people I work with who I do count as close friends, but they don’t work for my company – they’re clients, or contacts, and while seeing them is a pleasure, it’s not part of my everyday life. For 45 or 50 hours every week, I feel isolated.

Human resources experts say that employers have to tackle this. Employers should create support systems and “employee assistance programmes”, they “need to create a fun culture in order for employees to feel engaged, and this can be done by making sure there is a good balance of social events and everyday work”. That’s harder for companies to offer in an age of cuts and increasing casual work, of course, and it does raise the dread prospect of “compulsory fun”.
Advice columnists suggest having a bit more get up and go, advising that the shy might “appear aloof or uninterested even if that is not your intention … instead of focusing on your own discomfort, try to do all you can to put the other person at ease”. Right, because, we introverts have never thought of that. Or maybe we just find it almost impossible to do so, except in the most favourable circumstances. One expert advises breaking the ice each morning with a “Hi!”, as if that is a relationship builder, rather than something done by all but the most sociopathic.
I suppose that, for now, I’m resigned to being lonely at work. I wish I were a joiner, but I’m not; I wish I could banter away enthusiastically with people 10 or 15 years my junior, but our lives run on separate tracks. I’m hoping, I guess, for the moment when someone joins the company with whom I click. It only takes one person, but they’re not here now, and I feel bereft."

But what if, like busy GP Farrah Jarral, your body clock is permanently stuck in night-time mode?
For years, I have been trying to score the perfect night’s sleep in the face of a body clock that perks me up like a hyper-alert raccoon the moment the sun goes down, and a career that demands serious mental acuity. I would love to have the carefree sleep of my borderline-narcoleptic mother, to be able to drift into oblivion anywhere, any time. Instead, I have a distinctly unpoetic relationship with an array of devices that make up my bedtime ritual. Electric toothbrush. Useless scented candle. Satin eyemask. Silicone earplugs. Acrylic biteguards. Memory-foam pillow.
I have tried cutting down on the blue-light brain poison of a scrolling Twitter feed and clamping down on disruptive feline co-sleeping. I used a sleep-tracking app for a while, until I realised that keeping a phone in my bed, connected to the entire, exciting world in all its timezones, was a big mistake. I ditched it, but only after learning that I require seven and half hours’ sleep. This magic number has become an obsession, as I run tense calculations of my projected sleep quota every time I get into bed. I have even tried waking up at my usual weekday time of 6am at weekends to avoid “social jetlag”, but it made me feel like the pig in the cage in that Radiohead song.
Now I have accepted that mornings will always be gruelling for an owl who desperately wants to be a lark. I am also a firm believer in quality over quantity, and have discovered that the two things guaranteed to send me into a deep slumber are 1) going for a swim, and 2) a book called We Have Never Been Modern by Bruno Latour. I keep this slim volume permanently by my bedside, and while it is meant to be fascinating, I couldn’t comment, because I have never managed to get past page two.
I am also a seasoned snoozer. Snoozing is an appalling act of self-deception that does nothing but prolong the inevitable horror of getting up. I am currently trialling a zero-tolerance policy on bed relapses.
My sunrise-simulating alarm clock has helped ease grim winter mornings with a golden glow, but I still rely on a back-up alarm. Putting it on the other side of the room has ultimately been pointless, though, because I have adapted the ability to roll out of bed, lurch over, zombie-style, and switch it off without so much as dropping a Zzz.

In 2014, a study published by the Office for National Statistics ranked Britain as the loneliest nation in the European Union; only 58.4% of Britons said they knew people in their community well; we came 26th out of 28 countries for having someone we felt we could turn to in a crisis; and in a 2013 study by into wellbeing found that across all age groups, women reported feeling lonely more often than men. The 90s fetishised friendship through shows like Friends, This Life, and even, dare I say it, Sex and the City, which taught us that operating in a shoal of mates was the natural, inevitable state. But, as anyone who has ever taken to Facebook to ask 576 thumbs with profile photos if they fancy going to see this film tonight knows, sometimes friends are hard to find.
Step forward Hey! VINA. Hey VINA! is a new app that, in their own sphincter-crunching words, “empowers women to tap into the power of their extended network to make new connections in the real world”. This, for those of you who don’t speak fluent social media, basically means using your phone to pluck real life friends out of the muddy puddle we call People On The Internet. It would be too easy to sneer at such an idea – to throw our smart claws up in the air in horror at the sheer crassness of it all. But, there but for the grace of circumstance go us all.

Olivia Jane Poole co-created Hey! VINA after she moved to San Francisco to work as a tech entrepreneur. New to town, she signed up for a dating site and tried to use it to make female friends. Ours is an internet generation and so, as our foremothers looked to libraries, local shops, playgroups and cafes for friends, so we look to our various devices. It doesn’t surprise or disappoint me in any way that women like Poole are starting to use apps to make friends; we’re already using apps to find directions, shop for food, share photos, track our periods, rent houses and listen to the radio.
And it is the best of us – the bravest, the most proactive, the truly impressive – who take measures to meet new people
Part of the way Hey VINA! works is that members “take profile quizzes to get introduced to others with compatible interests, personalities, and lifestyles”. I love quizzes. Like anyone who grew up in the 90s I love answering mostly Bs to discover that I am an “outdoorsy person”. This is basically Sugar magazine made digital. “Maybe you’re a new mom, or you’re trying out Paleo and training for a marathon, or you’re single and need a fantastic wing-lady,” suggests the Hey VINA! website. Not fucking likely pal, but I do like the idea of meeting someone to go for a run with on a bright, cold Thursday morning. I do admire people who will reach out to new potential friends with whom to visit galleries. And it would have been great to have found a group of enthusiastic, confident, text message-analysing, late-night pudding people to go out with or discuss dates with, as my friends fell in love around me and dropped like flies.
After all, we are far more romantic with our friends than our partners. It is with my friends that I have gone on picnics, had late-night soul-bearing chats, spent sun-drenched holidays or rain-lashed long weekends. It is with friends that I have shared books, cold swims and brilliant secrets. It is when friends come round that I light candles, cook proper meals, wear nice clothes or hide the dirty forks in the oven so the kitchen looks nice. Because they are the ones that notice, the ones that appreciate it. The people you hook up with on Tinder are simply pleased to see that you have an open and working mouth – it’s your friends that care. And so to find yourself low on friends can feel a lot like the loneliness of lost love.

Loneliness isn’t something that only happens to older people. In fact, loneliness isn’t something that happens to other people at all. It follows us around like a heartbeat – sometimes unnoticed, sometimes impossible to ignore. It can come to anyone, given the circumstances.
And it is the best of us who take measures to meet new people. Of course you may not strike up an instant repartee with the women you meet through apps like Hey! VINA. But at least you’re doing something. Let’s not sneer at those using the internet to find pals instead of just a potential mate. Let us, instead, champion the companion. After all, some of us are just here to make friends."

How do you make Shakespeare instantly available? One answer is to film star actors doing great speeches. The first six videos in the Guardian’s Shakespeare Solos series do just that. What they reveal is how the camera can be an aid, rather than an enemy, in revealing the intricate thought processes behind the lines.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Eileen Atkins as Emilia
Shakespeare acting today puts comprehension before rhetoric: that’s what happens here. One of my favourite scenes shows Eileen Atkins sitting at a cafe table and using Emilia’s night-time words to Desdemona as a way of justifying the idea of female retaliation for male adultery. She might be any modern woman saying “what’s sauce for the goose” and Atkins, talking to the camera as if it were an intimate friend, suggests that Emilia’s “then let them use us well” is a feminist wake-up call to errant men.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ayesha Dharker as Titania
That ability to use the camera, especially in microscopic closeup, is seen to equally strong effect in Ayesha Dharker’s rendering of Titania’s “the forgeries of jealousy” speech from A Midsummer Night’s Dream. You can do that speech in a variety of ways, either stressing its emotional anger or lovingly caressing its beauty. But, as Dharker itemises the chaos in nature resulting from her quarrel with Oberon, you see a tear slowly falling from her eyes: it is as if she feels a regret for mankind that “this same progeny of evils comes from our debate”. Will Dharker still be able to cry at will when she plays Titania on stage at Stratford later this month?
The stage gives you the total picture: the camera can process thought. Most actors playing King Lear have to shout themselves hoarse to compete with a battery of sound-effects during the storm scene. Roger Allam, in this version, is up against nothing more than a wisp of dry-ice and allows the words to do the work: there is an angry defiance about Allam’s Lear so that when he cries: “Spit, fire! Spout, rain!” the plosive consonants evoke the chaos of nature. I can’t wait to see Allam play the king on stage.

Adrian Lester has already played Hamlet, for Peter Brook, so he knows his way round the “To be or not to be” speech: filmed in soul-searching close-up, Lester even raises his eyebrows on “to die – to sleep?” as if asking us the question.

In the case of David Morrissey’s witty rendering of Richard III’s opening speech, the camera shifts from profile shots to catch him head-on: this, above all speeches, shows a Shakespeare character treating the audience as fellow conspirators.

The opening batch is rounded off by Joanna Vanderham’s Juliet declaring her love for Romeo with guileless fervour. She displays all the anxiety of a young girl asking: “Dost thou love me?” and reassuring Romeo that she will be eternally true. Vanderham lets you see the mixed emotions coursing through Juliet’s brain.

What the six speeches confirm is that Shakespeare perfectly suits the camera, as long as you expose the sinews of thought and use the words as a key to the mind."

On 26 April, Stratford-upon-Avon parish archives record the baptism of “Gulielmus filius Iohannes Shakespere” (William, son of John Shakespeare). The Shakespeare household is comfortable: Mary (neé Arden) comes from a rich farming family; John is a maker of fine gloves and a successful businessman who will end up as Stratford’s mayor. William is one of seven children, and the oldest son. Though it’s usually celebrated on 23 April, his actual date of birth is unclear.
1582
Having received a top-notch education at Stratford grammar school, Shakespeare’s future is put in doubt when a local woman, Anne Hathaway, discovers she is pregnant with their child. She is 28, he is just 18; the couple have to apply for a special licence to marry in a hurry. Their first child, Susanna, is born the following May. Twins, Hamnet and Judith, follow in 1585. Another product of the love affair may be Shakespeare’s early sonnet 145, which puns teasingly on Anne’s maiden name (“‘I hate’ from hate away she threw”).

1592
Writer Robert Greene publishes a bitter denunciation of “an upstart crow” who “with his tiger’s heart wrapped in a player’s hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you”. This is the first reference to Shakespeare as a working playwright – maliciously twisting a line from Henry VI Part III to accuse its author (a mere “player”) of stealing tricks from his better-educated betters. It’s not clear when the 28-year-old Shakespeare first came to London and started working as an actor-writer. It’s even less clear when exactly he left his wife and three young children, still less how often – or even if – he returned to his home town.
1596
In August the 11-year-old Hamnet is buried in Stratford; cause of death is unknown, as is whether Shakespeare attends the funeral – though some biographers have speculated that his interest in putting twins on stage, and writing a play whose hero has a remarkably similar name to his dead son, is a quiet way of paying tribute. In any case, as a writer he has barely been busier. The early history plays (c1590–92) have been huge audience-pleasers; his gory, co-written tragedy Titus Andronicus (c1594) has been a success, as are The Comedy of Errors and A Midsummer Night’s Dream (c1594), and his titillating poem Venus and Adonis (1593), which has been a publishing sensation. Creatively, there seems to be little Shakespeare can’t do.

Shakespeare’s name appears on the front of the second published editions of his hit historical dramas Richard II and Richard III, as well as the first edition of Love’s Labour’s Lost – a rare honour for an Elizabethan playwright, one that indicates his burgeoning fame. Now a member of leading company the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, Shakespeare is also listed as one of the “principal comedians” in colleague-cum-rival Ben Jonson’s Every Man in His Humour. More ignobly, he is recorded as dodging taxes in the London ward of Bishopsgate.

A major turning point for Shakespeare and his company happens in May, when they throw open the doors on the Globe theatre, the most impressive playhouse London has yet seen (albeit built partly from the remains of their previous theatre in Shoreditch, demolished owing to a fractious land dispute). Henry V and Julius Caesar are among the new plays that christen the space, and 1599 may also be the year Shakespeare begins work on early drafts of Hamlet, a tragedy that occupies him in various forms until around 1604. In its experimental dramaturgy and its philosophical and emotional depth, Hamlet is Shakespeare’s most ambitious work to date, and one of the greatest pieces of theatre ever written in the English language.

1603
Another turning point occurs when Queen Elizabeth I – for whom the Lord Chamberlain’s Men performed regularly – dies. Luckily for the playwright, the new monarch, James I, soon takes Shakespeare and his colleagues under his wing and renames their company the King’s Men. As well as playing hectic seasons at court, Shakespeare will write several plays, notably Measure for Measure (1604) and Macbeth (1606), that flatter the king’s interests in justice, religion and witchcraft while simultaneously probing deep questions about power and its abuses.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Adrian Lester performs ‘To be or not to be’ from Hamlet
1606
King Lear has its premiere on 26 December in front of a packed court at Whitehall. It’s not known how James I responded to this bleakest of tragedies about a monarch who divides his kingdom and loses his mind, but Shakespeare seems to have been dissatisfied with the script, revising it several years later. Other plays he writes in this period – Othello, All’s Well That Ends Well, Timon of Athens – are similarly shadowy and equivocal in tone, perhaps reflecting the tense atmosphere at court following rumbling disputes about the unification of England and Scotland, and the shock discovery of the Gunpowder plot in November 1605. The sunny Elizabethan comedies Shakespeare perfected in the late 1590s seem a world away.

In the autumn season the King’s Men move into the Blackfriars, a well-appointed indoor playhouse across the Thames from the Globe that will be their winter home. Candlelit, intimate and with a resident company of musicians, the space inspires a final run of plays from Shakespeare: Pericles (c1609), Cymbeline (c1610), The Winter’s Tale (c1611) and The Tempest (c1611). Poetically dense, technically demanding and replete with mystic themes, they are the high points of his last great phase.
1612
In his introduction to The White Devil, the up-and-coming tragedian John Webster pays tribute to “the right happy and copious industry of M. Shake-speare”; by this stage, in his 48th year, Shakespeare has written at least 40 plays, and perhaps contributed to more. As well as being successful, he is wealthy – owner of the second largest house in Stratford and a portfolio of land investments. He is also highly litigious, particularly where money is involved. In 1612 he appears in court to testify in a case regarding the dowry of his French landlord’s daughter (despite owning a large amount of property, in London Shakespeare prefers to rent).
1613
Catastrophe strikes on 29 June, when the Globe burns to the ground after a prop cannon sets fire to the thatch during a performance of Shakespeare’s Henry VIII. The company promptly rebuild the theatre – this time with a tile roof – but their lead playwright is not involved; the event may hasten his retirement. Two final plays, Cardenio (the script is now lost), and The Two Noble Kinsmen, are his last contribution to the stage, both co-written with younger colleague John Fletcher.

In January, Shakespeare and his lawyers begin to draw up his will; in March, a number of last-minute changes are made – notably cutting out his daughter Judith (whose marriage he seems to have disapproved of), and bequeathing his 61-year-old wife his “second best bed”. Given the shaky state of his signature, Shakespeare himself may already be ailing; by the end of April he will be dead. He is buried soon afterwards in the same church where he was baptised, Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon, a few days after his 52nd birthday."

Frank Finlay obituary Read more
I first clocked Finlay when, as a theatre-mad teenager, I saw him in the opening season at the Belgrade, Coventry, in 1958. I especially recall him in Peter Ustinov’s Romanoff and Juliet playing the president of Europe’s smallest country seeking to maintain “the balance of feebleness” between the big powers. After a spell at the Royal Court, Finlay was also part of the embryonic National Theatre company that Laurence Olivier founded at Chichester in 1963.
It was there that Finlay gave one one of his greatest performances, playing a charismatically corrupt councillor – a self-styled “Napoleon of the north” – in John Arden’s momentous study of local politics, The Workhouse Donkey. I remember to this day the play’s carnivalesque finale, in which Finlay as the disgraced hero was carried shoulder-high from the theatre by his chanting supporters: for a moment it seemed as if a new kind of Dionysiac drama was possible.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Quiet realism … Frank Finlay as Iago with Laurence Olivier as Othello in the 1965 film. Photograph: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images
Olivier, who was sitting in front of me at the matinee I attended, obviously rated Finlay highly, since he made him an integral part of his National company at the Old Vic. Finlay was a wonderful Willie Mossop in Hobson’s Choice, a fine Iago to Olivier’s Othello – performing with a quiet realism that came into its own in the later film version – and a spry, nimble Joxer Daly to Colin Blakely’s Captain Boyle in Juno and the Paycock. But Finlay, who had a habit of appearing in many of my favourite modern plays, was at his superb best in Trevor Griffiths’s The Party, which marked Olivier’s farewell to the National in 1973. In this, Finlay played an itinerant northern playwright, closely modelled on David Mercer, and brought his habitual downright vigour to a speech in which he denounced our society’s ability to absorb protest, proclaiming “poverty is one of its best-favoured spectacles”.
Finlay was also excellent in Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Filumena partly because he was able to translate his understanding of working-class life to Eduardo de Filippo’s Neapolitan comedies. Another of his great gifts was to play European characters battered and wearied by experience, which is why he was natural casting as an exiled Czech communist in Howard Brenton’s Weapons of Happiness – the first commissioned play to be staged in the Lyttelton theatre in 1976. Finlay went on to achieve deserved fame in TV series such as Bouquet of Barbed Wire and Casanova and to make his mark in movies but, to me, he remains one of the best stage actors of his generation: capable of embodying a robust, northern hard-headedness while moving with panther-like grace."

What does it mean to be a good child? This production has no fear of meaty issues
Hands shoot up when King Minos of Crete, played by Rupert Holliday-Evans, asks for volunteers from the audience to go into the labyrinth and face the Minotaur. This audience is dying to be eaten. Or maybe they all want to be heroes? Minos is demanding his pound of flesh for the death of his son in battle by insisting that the defeated King Aegeus (Ben Adams) hand over 14 Athenian children to be sacrificed to the Minotaur, a monster with the head of a bull and the body of a man.
The weak and clownish Aegeus is so worried about his own popularity that he won’t even take responsibility for deciding which of the children in his kingdom will live or die. But is he about to be let off the hook by the arrival of his long-lost son, Theseus? Can Theseus (Theo Solomon) step up to the plate and be a hero? You’ve got to hand it to the Unicorn, a children’s theatre that’s always willing to tackle beefy stories.
This one for the over-eights has plenty lurking in the labyrinth, with issues of responsibility, heroism and war to the fore, and a strong theme exploring what it means to be a good child, and a good father to a child and a nation. Neither Aegeus nor Minos, a man who tells his daughter Ariadne (Anna Elijasz) that love is “childish,” are good role models. It’s up to the next generation to do better and take the bull by the horns.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ben Adams as King Aegeus in Minotaur. Photograph: Richard Davenport
Louie Whitemore’s clever design transforms the Unicorn’s main auditorium into a Greek amphitheatre, an interactive forum for drama and debate. Tarek Iskander’s spare production misses a trick (no doubt because of the doubling required for the role of the Minotaur) by not placing the actors constantly in our midst, thus reminding us that this is not a dusty story from long ago but about choices we make here and now.
It’s meaty stuff, and it’s not afraid of ambiguity or complexity. There are terrific moments – not least because there is no heroic victory in the slaying of the Minotaur, who is revealed not as a beast, but merely a man trapped in a labyrinth of pain. But Adam Peck’s script relegates Ariadne to bit-player, a passive princess waiting to be rescued, whose collusion in her brother’s death is underexplored.
It’s not remotely Boy’s Own, but the boys own this story.

In the latest from The Wrong Crowd, kite-flying turns out to be a miraculous cure for grief. In a show that’s likeable and charming but so wafer thin that the slightest gust might blow it away, Charlotte Croft plays a girl who, after her mother’s death, is taken by her grandmother (Liz Crowther) to live in London.
Bound by blood and unbound by grief, their relationship is difficult. The show’s wordless nature becomes a metaphor for the pair’s inability to communicate what they both feel. But then the benevolent wind – played by Linden Walcott-Burton and Nicola Blackwell – takes a hand, and the girl rediscovers her kite and takes off over the skies of London with Gran in hot pursuit.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Linden Walcott-Burton as The Wind in Kite. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian
The show acknowledges debts to The Red Balloon and The Snowman, but it never reaches the heights of either. It’s a piece that has moments of pleasure but too often seems laboured. The design strives to be flexible and clever, particularly when it is used to depict the country’s entire transport network, but it is often over-busy. Even the puppetry lacks precision, and because the storytelling is weak and characters one-dimensional, little things start to grate: exactly how old is the girl supposed to be? Why is Gran quite so unsympathetic? If she brought the kite with her, surely the child is already acquainted with the pleasures of kite-flying?
This is a show with the potential to take flight. It might yet, with more work. In its current form a surface slickness can’t disguise a lack of substance and texture in the relationship and story: it flips from sorrow to elation without taking us on a real emotional journey. Perfectly pleasant, but never heartbreaking or joyous enough to lift you out of your seat.

Jean Stein’s moral compass points the other way, but her oral history of Hollywood – a saga, like Steinbeck’s version of Genesis, about family squabbles and sins passed down, along with money, from one generation to the next – is also set outside the happy, innocent garden. The Pacific sunset on the cover of Stein’s book looks hellish, and the Hollywood sign, seen from behind, might be starting to spell the word “hollow”.
Southern California has its own myth of origins, which is less about tending God’s earth than redesigning or ravaging it to extract wealth. Stein’s assembled witnesses therefore begin by recalling two predatory capitalists, the “twisted godfathers” of Los Angeles. William Mulholland irrigated the desert by stealing water from neighbouring states, and Edward Doheny planted derricks to suck up oil on vacant lots all over the city. Doheny’s fortune placed him above the law – a bribery scandal was hushed up, as were the suspicious deaths of his son and a male friend – although he remained afraid of infernal retribution: a Catholic church built with his donations was nicknamed “Doheny’s fire escape”.
‘She was one of the most horrible people that ever lived,’ Gore Vidal says of his unmaternal mum
This piratical tycoon was gruesomely reincarnated by Daniel Day-Lewis in Paul Thomas Anderson’s There Will Be Blood and, true to that biblical prophecy, there is gore aplenty in the tales of dynastic might and hereditary guilt that Stein goes on to tell. One anecdote concerns a deranged heiress who appeared with blood dripping between her feet. “Holy shit,” gasped her minder, “she’s jammed something up her vagina.” No, she had merely jabbed an ice pick through her wrist and watched it emerge from the other side. One of the Hollywood star Jennifer Jones’s sons, fathered by the actor Robert Walker, shot himself in a closet above his marital bedroom, ensuring that his blood oozed down on to the sheets. Across town, a daughter born during Jones’s later marriage to the ketchup magnate Norton Simon hurled herself off a skyscraper. Her psychiatrist, sent to reclaim the body, was told by a gruff morgue attendant, “Lady, wake up, she fell 22 storeys. How much do you think we have?”
The families examined here are as dysfunctional as Adam and Eve, who after their eviction from Eden, begot the first murderer. Stein’s ditzy mother was usually to be found, when not in the cocktail lounge at the Beverly Hills hotel, “in her mirrored bathroom, which was a bad replica of the hall of Versailles”. Among her drinking chums was the multiply married mother of Gore Vidal, who neatly sums up life in the baronial mausolea these monsters built for their broods. “She was one of the most horrible people that ever lived,” Vidal says of his unmaternal mum. “All I wanted to do was murder her, and I never got around to it.” At least Cain only killed his brother; Vidal wishfully cast himself in a Greek version of the family romance, and mentally rehearsed the role of Orestes slaughtering Clytemnestra.
Stein’s subtitle describes Hollywood as “an American place”, but it is populated by Americans who envied and mimicked the worst of Europe, recreating the iniquities and inequalities that the pilgrim fathers wanted to leave behind. The studio boss Jack Warner, whose “vanity and gross vulgarity” Arthur Miller decries, is treated by his underlings “like he was the king of England”. Monarchical pomp often tips over into homegrown fascism. Warner favoured rounding up American commies and shipping them to Russia. His brother Harry advised President Roosevelt that refugees from Hitler could be accommodated in Alaska, a somewhat frostier Palestine. “Let the Jews settle there,” he shrugged, “they can adapt to any kind of weather.” Why are we surprised by Donald Trump’s embargo on migrant Muslims, or his plan for a fortified wall along the Rio Grande?
Eventually Stein lays bare her personal history. Her father, Jules Stein, founded the monopolistic talent agency MCA, and discreetly relied on mobsters with crooked noses to run interference; he and his partner, Lew Wasserman – a “yeller” whose angry rants caused an underling to suffer a heart attack – finessed Ronald Reagan’s transition from showbiz to politics.

Her parents expected Jean to purify the clan’s pedigree and launder its crassly gotten gains by marrying a European prince. Instead she settled down with the son of an immigrant worker in a New York mustard factory, and has diverted her inheritance to support arty, liberal causes on the east coast. She took over the literary magazine Grand Street in 1990, and her daughter Katrina vanden Heuvel edits The Nation, a self-proclaimed “antidote to Murdochisation”. As it happens, that’s an ironically futile mission statement, because Rupert Murdoch now owns Jules Stein’s estate in the Hollywood hills. Having bought the house and contents wholesale, Murdoch displays the Stein family’s photographs as though to suggest – providing you don’t look too closely – he himself were a descendant of the old-time moguls.
Outdoors, ground staff conscientiously keep up the pastoral pretence: every three weeks they plant a fresh crop of flowers, only to grub them out and replant others. But this small eden is under siege. Murdoch’s security guards are armed, in preparation for “hordes coming up the mountain, like the pillagers in Frankenstein”. Mountain lions snarl at the fences, and an irate owl recently gutted the patio chairs with its beak. Rattlesnakes wriggle through the shrubbery, to the delight of the Mexican workers, who take them home for dinner. Hollywood, like the America on whose western edge it lies, is an imaginary garden with real reptiles in it.

The limitations of much of the press coverage led, inevitably, to a dangerous oversimplification in which Mubarak was bad and the Tahrir Square crowds were good (except for those men raping women in the square), with Barack Obama speaking for us all when he said: “Egyptians have inspired us… they have changed the world”. The Egyptian army was good because it did nothing to stop the protesters (unlike the central security forces), but it became bad when it helped to create the post‑Mubarak regime.
Egypt itself went from inspiring to horrifying, as the revolution was overcome by a counter-revolution, while the perception of the struggle morphed from people versus tyrant to violent Islamist martyrs versus the forces of order. The real story is more confused and more complicated, and, as Shenker presents it in this detailed, meticulous and fascinating book, more hopeful.
Most coverage of the movement that overthrew Mubarak tended to focus on the square, although some commentators did look back to the previous summer, 2010, when policemen in Alexandria dragged a young man called Khaled Said into the street and beat him to death. The response to the murder and inevitable cover-up was as unexpected by the Mubarak regime as it was by bored journalists. The effect of the “We are all Khaled Said” slogan – with its suggestion that any Egyptian could now be dragged out of a cafe and beaten to death – has been overstated, but it was a symptom of a growing desperation.
The perception of the struggle morphed from people versus tyrant to violent Islamist martyrs versus the forces of order
But Shenker has traced those fault-lines much farther back in history, to the uprising of Colonel Urabi in 1881, when the British invaded to keep the Egyptian viceroy in place, and to the fiasco of the Arab-Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973, after which Nasser insisted that citizens should allow the state to know best.
A historical long view is just one of the things that makes this book stand out. Shenker mixes details of the events that landed presidents Mubarak and his Islamist successor Morsi in prison with a first-hand view of the country since the return of the strongman era – with Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, Morsi’s defence minister, now president. Sisi has stated that if the sort of crowds that gathered to demand Morsi’s departure came out against him, he would step down. But, as Shenker shows, Sisi has since done much to ensure those crowds will not gather by changing laws, stifling dissent and even planning a new, easier-to-police capital city.
This, along with the continuing violence, lies behind the media simplification that “poor Egypt” is doomed. While Shenker accepts that Sisi’s regime is more repressive “than almost anything that has passed before”, he also shows that one of the great achievements of the struggle that led to the 25 January revolution is the insistence of many Egyptians that they have rights. So while there will be many dark days ahead, this detailed, passionate book shows why “to the frustration of those who seek to neutralise it, that struggle cannot be contained”.

Are authors running out of titles? January and February’s offerings suggest they’re finding it increasingly difficult to devise new ones. Instead they settle for names that recycle, reference or rework those of other books or artworks.
Sometimes the aim is evidently to associate the new work with the old one in the buyer’s mind, as when Helen Ellis’s American Housewife brazenly recalls Curtis Sittenfeld’s American Wife (just as Paula Hawkins’s mega-selling, girl-less The Girl on the Train nodded to Gone Girl). Or they suggest it belongs to traditions beloved of the author, like Christopher Brookmyre’s Black Widow, previously used for several films noirs and characters in comics; or that it might be a just-discovered posthumous offering, as with Robert Ryan’s Dr Watson mystery The Sign of Fear (modelled on Conan Doyle’s The Sign of Four).
Other borrowings gild a modern narrative with literary grandeur by drawing their titles from ancient or classic works: Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchman (from Isaiah) has been followed in this respect by Adriana Trigani’s All the Stars in the Heavens (from Revelation) and Patrick Flanery’s I Am No One (from the Polyphemus episode in The Odyssey, and possibly Emily Dickinson).
Often, though, they just seem an echo of someone else’s title: Janice YK Lee’s The Expatriates (Chris Pavone’s The Expats), Nicholas Searle’s The Good Liar (The Good Lie, a 2014 Reese Witherspoon movie) and Yelena Moskovich’s The Natashas (identical to a non-fiction book’s title).
Plenty of other current or imminent titles, fiction and non-fiction, similarly seem to be inspired by visits to the secondhand shop. There, writers find and adapt names already used: for an Auden poem (Joan Bakewell’s Stop the Clocks); a Restoration play (David Harvey’s The Ways of the World); a Bowie single (Ali Eskandarian’s Golden Years); a Lou Reed single (Raphael Montes’s Perfect Days); as well as a Mal Peet book, a Robert Fripp album and a TV series (Helen Dunmore’s Exposure).
Even literary grandees have been caught up in this epidemic, with Howard Jacobson’s Shylock Is My Name recalling a now-axed American sitcom and Julian Barnes in The Noise of Time (see above), using a name that previously belonged to Osip Mandelstam and a show by Complicite. The Spanish author Javier Marías, whose forthcoming Thus Bad Begins (a quote from the “closet” scene in Hamlet) invites the reader to connect two worlds, those of the new work and the text it borrows from."
Poetry|Carol Rumens's poem of the week|Federico García Lorca|blogposts,2016-02-01T10:19:44,guardian,Carol Rumens,"Using Lorca to riff on a humble, homely scene, these short verses thread together some unsettling thoughts on endings",https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/01/poem-of-the-week-casida-of-the-dead-sun-by-rebecca-perry,Poem of the week: Casida of the Dead Sun by Rebecca Perry,en,culture|books,,"Casida of the Dead Sun
the earth reedless, a pure form,
closed to the future
Federico García Lorca: Casida of the Recumbent Woman
The world is in the process of ending.
The insects have dropped from the air.
The last wasp is sinking through
the gloopy green water of a garden pond,
the most melancholy diver.
The sun is on its back at the very top
of the sky, floating bleakly, jelly-eyed.
A toad’s heart is blinking inside
its nobbly body as it contemplates
the infinite civilisations of the world,
the disappointment of having
only ever truly known this one.
From Rebecca Perry’s varied and engaging first collection Beauty/Beauty, this week’s poem, as the epigraph suggests, draws on Casida IV by Federico García Lorca. The Lorca poem, Casida de la Mujer Tendida, with an English translation by Michael Smith, can be read here.
Beauty/Beauty by Rebecca Perry review – curiosity, clumsiness and charm Read more
The traditional Arabian qaṣīdah (or casida) was a mono-rhymed, formally-structured panegyric, which embraced a complex of themes besides the admirable qualities of the poet’s patron. (Indeed, the treatment could also be satirical). Verses traditionally included descriptions of camels or horses, the trials of daily nomadic life, battle-victories, and a lament for a lost beloved. Lorca makes the form richly his own.
Rebecca Perry’s Casida of the Dead Sun draws on the Lorca poem, but significantly departs from it. First, the obvious similarities: Perry’s “garden pond” might have been suggested by his image of the world as “reedless”. The immediate source of the terminal scenario, indicated by the title, might be Lorca’s description of the earth as “closed to the future”. And the toad in the fourth stanza has clearly hopped out of the Lorca poem. Perry, however, explores further what the concealed heart of the creature might contain, and also briefly conjures a physical presence in the homely and exact epithet, “nobbly”. Note that “gloopy” shares the same pleasingly tactile and informal register.
I like Perry’s subversive and detached approach. She rejects what would be the easy option of the erotic female body as focus. She avoids any sort of grand manner beyond the title: in fact, the poem seems a kind of put-down of that title. This dead sun may not be the burnt-out star at the end of earth’s history. Both the sun and the small creatures facing extinction may be allegorical, images of loss suffered by a “recumbent woman” we never get to see.
Somehow, the poem resembles a primitivist painting, one of the less exotic landscapes by Henri Rousseau, perhaps, vividly splicing realist and surrealist elements. The images are local, almost rustic: the pond’s stagnant soup contains nothing more symbolically potent than the last wasp (though considerable pathos is hinted in the phrase, “the most melancholy diver”). As for the sun, in Perry’s descriptive transformation it might be another form of pond-life, “floating bleakly, jelly-eyed” as if on the surface of the water. The naive and picturesque imagery is completed and then complicated by the toad. It hides profundity in its humble, and perhaps magical, form, regretting the missed opportunity to have known something more of “the infinite civilisations of the world”. Whatever the status of the light extinguished, the toad represents consciousness of the intellectual dimensions of the loss.
There’s a flicker of humour playing at the edges of this poem and, I suspect, a challenge to the masculine ethos of the qaṣīdah. Lorca’s poem is imbued with an aching awareness of the decay in the erotic. Perry, by entirely different means, miniaturises and controls a drama that is less gendered and anthropocentric, but still projects universality.
Although Perry’s collection marks the accomplishment of her own voice and style, a poem like the Casida of the Dead Sun points to her readiness for wider challenges, including a fruitful exchange with other writers and languages. Beauty/Beauty is an accessible but innovative debut. This review will give you a fuller sense of the originality of the achievement."

Suspended SNP MP accuses JK Rowling of bullying in Twitter spat Read more
On her website Pottermore over the weekend, as part of a “celebration of Harry Potter” at the Universal Orlando resort, Rowling treated fans to an insight into school life at three international magical schools.
Uagadou in Uganda, for which “the only address ever given is ‘Mountains of the Moon’”, is “a stunning edifice carved out of the mountainside and shrouded in mist, so that it sometimes appears simply to float in mid-air”, revealed the Harry Potter author. Its students are particularly strong in astronomy, alchemy and self-transfiguration. “Much (some would say all) magic originated in Africa,” writes Rowling – and many cast their spells by pointing their fingers or with hand gestures, the wand being a European invention. “This gives Uagadou students a sturdy line of defence when accused of breaking the International Statute of Secrecy (‘I was only waving, I never meant his chin to fall off’).”
At Japan’s Mahoutokoro, which is “made of mutton-fat jade, and stands on the topmost point of the ‘uninhabited’ (or so Muggles think) volcanic island of Minami-Iwō-jima”, pupils receive enchanted robes when they first arrive, at the age of seven, wrote Rowling. The robes grow as their wearer does, and change colour as the wearer’s magical knowledge grows, starting out “a faint pink colour” and eventually turning gold, “if top grades are achieved”. But if the robes turn white, revealed the novelist, “this is an indication that the student has betrayed the Japanese wizard’s code and adopted illegal practices (which in Europe we call ‘Dark’ magic)”.
At Castelobruxo in Brazil, meanwhile, “an imposing square edifice of golden rock, often compared to a temple”, students “wear bright green robes and are especially advanced in both Herbology and Magizoology”.

There are 11 great wizarding schools in total, also providing the name of a fourth new location: North American magical school Ilvermorny. Rowling has already alluded to a school in the US on Twitter, mentioning that Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne in the forthcoming Harry Potter spinoff film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, was “going to meet people who were educated at” the school, that it was not in New York and that the school would have relevance to Native American Indian culture.

Set in New York 70 years before the Harry Potter stories, the screenplay for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is written by Rowling herself. Due out in November, the film will tell the story of the magizoologist Newt Scamander, author of the textbook studied by Harry and his friends at Hogwarts."
Ursula K Le Guin|Fantasy|Science fiction|Fiction|Documentary|Kickstarter|news,2016-02-01T14:10:03,guardian,Alison Flood,Film-maker Arwen Curry launches appeal for funds to complete study of revered science fiction and fantasy author,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/01/ursula-k-le-guin-documentary-maker-turns-to-kickstarter-for-funds,Ursula K Le Guin documentary maker turns to Kickstarter for funds,en,culture|books,,"The director of the first documentary to explore the “remarkable life and legacy” of the novelist Ursula K Le Guin has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise the last tranche of money needed for the film to go ahead.
Arwen Curry has filmed “dozens” of hours of interviews with Le Guin over the last seven years, capturing one of science fiction’s most respected authors in the “spectacular real-life places that inspired her fantastical worlds”, the director and producer said. The documentary, which also features interviews with Le Guin’s fans and fellow writers Michael Chabon, Margaret Atwood and Neil Gaiman, will explore the novelist’s life, from her early years into becoming a writer Curry said is “one of the most important feminist voices on the American literary scene”.
Called Worlds of Ursula K Le Guin, the feature documentary was awarded a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities last summer, but the funds will only be released once the entire production budget for the project has been raised. So Curry has turned to Kickstarter to crowdfund the remaining $80,000 (£56,000) that the film needs in order to be completed.
With $6,000 already raised just hours after the fundraiser opened, and backers able to pledge everything from $15 for a Le Guin badge to $1,000 for a one-minute recording from the author responding to a query on writing or life, Curry said the Kickstarter “seems to be doing well so far”. “I based the goal on our need and on the campaigns of similar feature docs, particularly recent ones about Edgar Allan Poe and the Raisin in the Sun playwright Lorraine Hansberry, both of which were also funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. So I’m hoping it’s a reasonable benchmark,” she said.
Curry described Le Guin, author of the much-loved Earthsea fantasy series, as an important influence in her life since she was young.
“Seven years is a long time to wave a camera in someone’s face. I’ve filmed Ursula in the now-infamous high desert of southeastern Oregon, on the rocky coast, and at her family’s home in the Napa Valley, where she first heard many of the legends and tales that would come to influence her fiction,” she said. “We’ve also filmed a lot in her living room, and shared some meals. As a person, she’s an incredibly wide-ranging but firmly planted person, and always paying attention. As a writer, she opened doors for generations of fans and younger writers, both inside and outside of genre fiction. She made that boundary porous in a way that enriched literature for all of us, without ever spitting on her genre roots.”
Chabon, interviewed for the film, which is due out in mid 2017, called Le Guin “one of the greatest writers the 20th-century American literary scene has produced”, saying that “each world, each planet, that she creates is a kind of experiment, a laboratory”.
“People always say ‘when did you decide you wanted to be a writer?’ And I never wanted to be a writer. I just wrote. It’s what I did. It’s the way my being was,” says Le Guin in another interview filmed by Curry. The author of novels including The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed also tells Curry that “any kind of imaginative fiction trains people to be aware that there are other ways to do things, other ways to be”.
“In the film, we’ll accompany Le Guin on an intimate journey of self-discovery as she comes into her own as a major feminist author, inspiring generations of women and other marginalised writers along the way. To tell this story, the film reaches into the past as well as the future – to a childhood steeped in the myths and stories of disappeared Native peoples Le Guin absorbed as the daughter of prominent California anthropologist Alfred Kroeber and author Theodora Kroeber,” writes Curry on her Kickstarter.
“Le Guin’s story allows audiences to reflect on science fiction’s unique role in American culture, as a conduit for our utopian dreams, apocalyptic fears, and tempestuous romance with technology. More than ever, we need to perform the kinds of thought experiments that Le Guin pioneered, to ask how we should behave as our technologies transform us beyond the wildest dreams of our grandparents.”"

As well as concluding the 2015 literary prize season, Frances Hardinge’s success (see interview, page 15) this week in winning the Costa book of the year award confirmed its status as a bad one for men.

Only Marlon James’s victory in the Man Booker prize prevented a female clean sweep in the top prizes for imaginative writing, with the others going to Ali Smith (Baileys prize for women’s fiction), Claudia Rankine (Forward poetry prize for best collection), Sarah Howe (TS Eliot poetry prize) and Hardinge.
Ian McKellen observed this week that “no openly gay man has won an Oscar”. If Steve Silberman, who won the Samuel Johnson prize for non-fiction, is added, three of the six – also including James and Smith – are gay. Howe is mixed race (“half-Chinese, half-English”), while James and Rankine are both African-Caribbean.
Anyone looking for further pointers for the 2016 season may note that living or working in the US seems to be auspicious (true of Silberman, Howe, James and Rankine, the latter trio having academic posts there).

Where betting on their prizes was possible, the winning authors were invariably underrated. James’s A Brief History of Seven Killings was a 4/1 shot, third-placed after the short-odds favourite, Hanya Yanagihara’s A Little Life. Silberman’s Neurotribes similarly lagged behind shortlisted books by Robert Macfarlane and Emma Sky. Sarah Waters was odds-on to take the Baileys prize, relegating Smith’s How to Be Both to 3/1 second favourite.
Only Hardinge, though, was an outsider: of the five Costa category winners vying for the overall award, her children’s novel The Lie Tree was – perhaps precisely because it was a children’s novel, the genre having last won in 2002 – the joint back-marker on 5/1."

I was in Barcelona attending a theatre festival, and everywhere I went I saw giant posters featuring photographs of pink crosses in the desert, emblazoned with the title 2666. It was a fascinating, enigmatic and mysterious image.
I soon learned that these posters were advertisements for the equally enigmatic novel 2666 by author Roberto Bolaño, his final work before his death three years earlier. Although he was born in Chile and spent his formative years in Mexico City, Bolaño lived in Barcelona during his final years and the book was published there shortly after his death.

At that time, the novel had not yet been published in English. I read it as soon as it became available and was blown away. I marvelled at its scope, audacity and five-part structure – which shifts in tone from Pedro Almodóvar-like comedy to film noir to frenetic hyper-realism, finishing with an extraordinary “fairytale” section that takes readers on a tour of the 20th century, particularly focusing on the calamities of second world war and the Holocaust.
Few other contemporary novels had ever involved me so completely; I was convinced (and still am) that 2666 will be regarded as one of the great books of the 21st century, as much as Moby-Dick is considered one of the great novels of the 19th. The two works have many parallels, actually: they both explore (in highly poetic terms) visions of extraordinary evil – Bolaño’s being a string of hundreds of horrifying murders committed in a small Mexican city. Although those incidents are at the thematic centre of 2666, the book is about many, many other issues and ideas, perhaps most eloquently the act of writing and artistic creation itself.
2666 is probably the last novel that one would consider adapting for the stage: aside from its epic length and breadth, Bolaño’s writing is primarily thematic and discursive, and not presented in a narrative format. I found myself so thoroughly engaged with the novel after reading it – and, if for no other reason than to figure out exactly why it had such a hold on me, I embarked on a very personal journey to explore this work in theatrical terms.
Throughout my creative life I’ve found that, rather than selecting projects to work on, projects choose me, often because I find them daunting, even overwhelming. This has certainly been true of 2666. I have never previously wanted to adapt a novel for the stage, let alone a novel of this complexity; I certainly never thought, during the work’s earliest stages at least, that 2666 could actually be produced on stage. But this became a passion project, and one that has endured for nearly a decade now.

Several years into the work, I realised that I was stymied by my own limitations as an adaptor. I mentioned this to Seth Bockley, a writer and director who was then part of the Goodman Playwrights Unit. I found that, like me, Seth is fascinated by the writings of Bolaño, especially 2666 – and, unlike myself, is also fluent in Spanish. Eventually, I asked him to work as a co-adaptor and co-director; these roles are inextricably linked in my mind. During my nearly 30 years as artistic director of the Goodman, I have never before entered into this kind of collaboration. However, I felt that this partnership would creatively shake me up. Seeing this project through the eyes of a fellow artist, a collaborator, has provided a whole new realm of insight.
Summer voyages: 2666 by Roberto Bolaño Read more
The process of adapting this “great, torrential work” has taken on a life of its own; over the course of multiple readings and workshops we gathered together a group of collaborators – actors, designers, dramaturgs – who, like us, have embraced Bolaño’s vision and shared our passion for creating a theatrical language to communicate that vision. The novel features a rich tapestry of characters, stories and themes that span over 100 years and dozens of countries. Distilling that information occupied many hours of conversation as we honed the script. Each of the novel’s five sections is written in a distinctly different style and tone, so the process of bringing Bolaño’s language to life on stage required us to utilise all the theatrical tools at our disposal – ensemble acting, inventive design, lush musical scoring and a blending of video and live performance – to create what we hope will be an event that matches the novel in its ambition and reach.
From the beginning of this process, I was inspired by a number of the massive works that I’ve seen in Europe, particularly in Germany and England – for example, the National Theatre’s adaptation of Philip Pullman’s trilogy His Dark Materials. 2666 remains an effort of love, discovery and passion. After spending nearly a decade working on this adaptation, I can honestly say that my 2666 experience continues to be among the most challenging and most important work of my life – as profound and mysterious as it was when I first saw those posters for the book all over Barcelona."
Books|Instagram|features,2016-02-01T17:00:21,guardian,Marta Bausells,"A teenager’s fantasy to read whatever Florence + the Machine recommended has become an online group with more than 25,000 Instagram followers – in collaboration with the star herself",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/01/florence-welch-machine-fan-dream-stars-book-club,Florence and the lit scene: how a fan's dream became a star's book club,en,culture|books,,"A teenager’s fantasy to read whatever Florence + the Machine recommended has become an online group with more than 25,000 Instagram followers – in collaboration with the star herself
Last summer at Normandy music festival Beauregard, Florence Welch, frontwoman of Florence + the Machine, took to the mic between songs and recognised two teenagers in the crowd. “She spoke to us between the lyrics, asking what we were doing in France,” said Leah Moloney, “[Then she] told the crowd we were special guests and got us up on stage.” What makes the scene particularly unusual is that the musician and the fans had already met, having got to know each other online through a shared love of literature. Welch announced to the crowd that the girls ran her online book club, waving a sign with the words Between Two Books on it.
These days, it is not unusual for a book club to be hosted on social media – or led by a celebrity. Emma Watson has just kicked off her feminist club Our Shared Shelf on Amazon-owned Goodreads, while Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg had a go at a year-long one on his own social network – with mixed results. Oprah Winfrey’s own became “2.0” in 2012, with a new focus on social media.
But the likelihood of a fan’s tweet getting through the online clutter and not only reach, but convince a rock star to take on her own idea are small, at best. When a 14-year-old Moloney tweeted at Welch in 2012, she never expected a book club – and relationship – to form; but Between Two Books now counts more than 26,000 followers on Instagram.

In July 2012, Welch tweeted a picture of herself in front of Portland’s independent bookshop Powell’s, with the caption ”Booksbooksbooksbooks”. “I always looked up to her and knew she was very literary … I thought it would be cool if she had a proper book club,” says Moloney. “I responded to her tweet and said we should start a book club, where fans read books on her recommendation.”
“I wasn’t entirely serious, and knew it was a far-fetched idea. She was very elusive and not even that active on social media,” said Moloney, who started the project with friends Abbie Whitehead and Heather Hale. To her surprise, Welch took her up on it, messaging her and offering to help. Within a week, the star was promoting the club at a gig in Indianapolis, flaunting the book on stage in the city where, coincidentally, the first club choice – Opposed Positions by Gwendoline Riley – was set. She announced the name – Flow’s Book Club, or Between Two Books. “I don’t understand the internet, so I could get that a bit confused,” joked Welch.
Three-and-a-half years later, the book club lives on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. Welch and fans have read 18 books together, ranging from John Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces to Patti Smith’s memoir Just Kids, and have taken part in projects like a bookmark design competition judged by the musician. “So shall we do this poetry thing, then?” asked Welch on a post inviting followers to read young LA poet Mira Gonzalez alongside Ted Hughes. “Honored to be the current subject of @betweentwobooks … Maybe I should join the club once it’s a book I haven’t already read:) Hello kids!” Instagrammed Lena Dunham when her memoir was the book of choice.
“It’s all very fluid and organic collaboration,” said Moloney, adding that this arrangement matches Welch’s own personality. Despite the size of the project now, it lacks a specific structure and remains fan-run, adapting to the star’s erratic schedule. Everyone posts when they are available, and Welch’s involvement ranges from posting pictures of what she’s reading to hosting charity fundraisers or interviewing Donna Tartt (taking readers’ questions).

Moloney, who is in frequent communication with Welch and posts on her behalf from Dublin, where she is a student, has become aware of the power of the club in promoting literature. “[Welch] has always been so into it. It’s a really lovely thing for me too – I’ve always been into reading. When I was eight or nine, reading was not something you would admit to. It wasn’t seen as cool. This is so good because we can use her name to promote reading. I definitely think that reading has become a more ‘hip’ thing to do lately.”
Reflecting on the last few hectic years, Moloney, now 19, highlights how Between Two Books has affected readers’ lives. After the France gig, she “wanted to give something back” to Welch and asked book clubbers to write what the club had done for them. “Many got back to me saying that they were in a bad place, and knowing Florence was reading the same book as them made them feel more connected. I have felt that too about reading with someone else – knowing that someone else has read the same exact lines can really help.”
For now, it’s time to read Haruki Murakami’s The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, on the recommendation of fellow musicians the Maccabees – as well as Patti Smith."

She was born in Enfield, north London, to Walter Ison, an accountant with the Colne Valley Water Company, and his wife Hilda (nee Boston), who died when Sue was 13; her father remarried two years later. Sue went to St Hilda’s girls’ school in Bushey, Hertfordshire, becoming only the second pupil there to take A-levels. In 1964, she spent a year at Brighton Library School, returning to Hertfordshire to become the first children’s librarian at Hoddesdon library.
In 1965 Sue married John Jones, deputy county librarian, and they soon had three children. After a career break, she returned to work in 1978, and the following year became librarian at Simon Balle secondary school in Hertford.
Sue’s life turned upside down when John died suddenly in 1990. She started to embrace travel and explored many different places, with India, New York and New Zealand among her favourites.
The same year that our father died, our mother joined Hertfordshire’s schools library service, and her career took off. She was appointed head of the service in 1999. In 2004, she became chair of Ascel, the association of senior children’s and education librarians. She also chaired the youth and school committee for the library professionals body Cilip. She was appointed OBE in 2009.
After her official retirement, Sue worked for the Reading Agency, as programme manager for young people, and was passionate about the charity’s mission to inspire more people to read more. Working primarily in partnership with libraries, she helped deliver projects to engage children in storytelling and reading, including Chatterbooks, Reading Hack and the Summer Reading Challenge. In 2014, she represented the Reading Agency in Brazil as part of the British Council’s Transform programme.
In 2012, Sue began the first of several rounds of chemotherapy but was determined to carry on working and travelling. She never complained and remained good-humoured. She also took great delight in her four grandchildren, Daisy, Linus, George and Leyton, who survive her along with us."

How do you mostly listen to music?
I can’t go anywhere without headphones on. Even if it’s just to the local shop and back, I’ll listen to something on my phone. I also take my wireless speaker with me whenever I’m travelling for more than a couple of days.
What was the first record you bought?
It was probably Extreme’s III Sides to Every Story when I was 11 or 12. My dad used to make tapes for me, so I was a bit slow to start buying my own music. I’ve more than made up for it since.
What was the last piece of music you bought?
Two EPs by the French DJ/producer 20syl, and the vocal score of Bernstein’s Candide. I also bought (and love) David Bowie’s Blackstar.
If you found yourself with six months free to learn a new instrument, what would you choose?
In the cupboard under my stairs, I have an ever-growing pile of synthesisers, drum machines, loop pedals and keyboards. I’d bite your whole arm off for the chance to run away for six months and learn how to make them all work properly.

Is applauding between movements acceptable?
Absolutely. Except when it isn’t.
What single thing would improve the format of the classical concert?
Getting rid of white tie: it looks pompous and is hellishly uncomfortable. And I always forget my cufflinks.
What’s been your most memorable live music experience as an audience member?
Watching a group of Palestinian kids sing the round Ah, Poor Bird in an ancient, tiny Greek Orthodox church on a hill-side outside Ramallah. We were visiting with the charity Choir of London, who do amazing work with people of all ages throughout the occupied territories.

Do you enjoy musicals? Do you have a favourite?
The Book of Mormon is one of the best things ever written in any form and in any age. My girlfriend laughed so hard she headbutted the chair in front.
What is the best new piece written in the past 50 years?
Written on Skin by George Benjamin. And not just because I was fortunate enough to be involved with its premiere, or because George is a lovely man. It’s a piece of searing beauty.

Which non-classical musician would you love to work with?
Argh. That’s tough. Can I form a supergroup? Stevie Wonder, Jónsi, Frederic Robinson, Jonny Greenwood, and me on triangle.
What do you sing in the shower?
I don’t ever sing in the shower. Probably because I’m concentrating instead on shampooing my beard.

He has worked with his adventurous kora-playing compatriot Ba Cissoko, toured the US with bluesman Corey Harris, and while in France has recorded with Fatoumata Diawara. Now comes his debut solo album, dominated by easygoing, rolling songs that show off his pleasantly relaxed vocal work and fluid guitar solos. There are songs where he echoes Salif Keita, if without Keita’s thrilling ability to surprise, and songs where the emphasis veers from west Africa towards western styles. He has clearly made friends in France, and one of the most charming songs, Gassata, features singer Piers Faccini and the adventurous cellist Vincent Ségal, famed for his recordings with Ballaké Sissoko. Kouyaté has yet to discover a distinctive musical identity, but he’s a classy and versatile musician, and clearly a man to watch."

Lynne follows the likes of Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers and Lionel Richie, who have attracted huge crowds to the festivals main stage for crowdpleasing sets of old favourites. Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis claimed Parton attracted the biggest crowd the event had ever seen when she appeared in 2014.
The return and rise of Jeff Lynne and ELO has been one of music’s surprise stories of the past few years. When Lynne released an album under the ELO name in 2001, Zoom, it reached only No 34 in the UK charts. However, after Lynne appeared at a Children in Need benefit concert in November 2013, he was persuaded by Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans to perform under the ELO name at a Radio 2 concert in Hyde Park. The 50,000 tickets for the show sold out in 15 minutes, since when Jeff Lynne’s ELO have announced sellout arena shows and released an album, Alone in the Universe, that reached No 4 in the UK.
The Sunday afternoon appearance by an older musician has become known as the “legend slot” owing to the calibre of the artists appearing in it. Last October, Leo Sayer claimed he was in the running to fill the bill in 2016, saying on ITV’s Loose Women: “It’s on the cards man. I want do to it. Why not?”"
Music|Pop and rock|Race issues|news,2016-02-01T10:21:54,guardian,Guardian Music,"The former Pantera singer has apologised for his actions, but he has been called to account by fellow metal artists",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/01/metal-community-condemns-racism-phil-anselmo-nazi-salute-white-power,Metal community condemns Phil Anselmo over Nazi salute and shout of 'white power',en,culture|music,,"The former Pantera singer has apologised for his actions, but he has been called to account by fellow metal artists
Metal musicians have condemned Pantera frontman Philip Anselmo after he was filmed last week giving a Nazi salute and shouting “white power”.
Anselmo was filmed by a fan at the Dimebash event on 22 January, a tribute to Pantera’s late guitarist “Dimebag” Darrell Abbott. He claimed at first he had been making a joke about the white wine served to performers at the event, who included Dave Grohl and members of Metallica, and said: “I fucking love everyone, I fucking loathe everyone, and that’s that. No apologies from me.”
He backtracked on that on Saturday, when he issued a statement on Housecore Records’ YouTube channel, saying:
“Philip H Anselmo here, and I’m here to basically respond to all the heat I’ve been getting that I deserve completely. “I was at the Dimebash, and it was extremely late at night. There was heavy-duty talk between myself and those who love Dime. And heavy emotions were flowing, jokes were made backstage that transpired upon the stage, and it was ugly. It was uncalled for. And anyone who knows me and my true nature knows that I don’t believe in any of that; I don’t want to be part of any group. I’m an individual, and I am a thousand percent apologetic to anyone that took offence to what I said because you should have taken offence to what I said. And I am so sorry, and I hope you just … man, give me another chance to … just give me another chance. I love all of you. And anyone who’s met me, anyone who knows me knows that I love all of you. Bless you.”
Anselmo has been widely condemned for his remarks in the metal community, not least because he has been linked with racism in the past. In 1994, questioned on MTV about allegations of racist elements in his lyrics, he refused to condemn fans shouting “white power” at Pantera gigs. The following year, after telling fans “Pantera are not a racist band”, he condemned rap artists for “pissing all over white culture” and concluded: “Tonight is a white thing.” In 2015 he expressed his regret for incorporating the Confederate flag into cover artwork for his band Superjoint Ritual.
This time, musicians have come forward to call out Anselmo.
“Seeing Phil’s actions and his cowardly justification is not only disgusting and inexcusable but antithetical to the punk, metal, underground ethos to which we subscribe,” said the metalcore band All Shall Perish. “Racism has no place in metal to me, metal/punk/hardcore/whateverthefuckyoucallit should be unifying,” said Darkest Hour’s Mike Schleibaum.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch Machine Head’s Robb Flynn respond to Anselmo’s Nazi salute and shout of ‘white power’.
Machine Head frontman Robb Flynn was one of Anselmo’s strongest critics, uploading an 11-minute video in which he pointed out that Anselmo’s initial explanation was misleading, since white wine was not served to performers. “Only in the metal community is something like this so, so brushed off,” Flynn said. “If this was Chad from Nickelback, if this was Justin Bieber, if this was Tom Brady, if this was Lars fucking Ulrich … heads would roll.”
Flynn said Anselmo had been making racially charged remarks backstage at Dimebash, and had been giving Nazi salutes and mouthing “white power” while Flynn performed.
Former Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach offered his condemnation via Twitter, condemning racists and those who condone them through silence as “pussies”.
Sebastian Bach (@sebastianbach) Rock is supposed 2B fun. Perverting music N2 hate? NOT fun. People who say White Power are PUSSIES. As r those who agree. Or remain silent🖕🏿
Evanescence guitarist Jen Majura said: “If this is his real opinion and his real way of thinking, I just have one thing to say: Phil Anselmo, fuck you!”
The Metal Sucks website was among several major metal outlets to condemn Anselmo strongly, noting the pattern in his behaviour over many years. “It’s Mel Gibson Syndrome: the guy works in an industry surrounded by Jews and African Americans, but get enough drinks in him, and he almost involuntarily starts to drop racist and anti-semitic epithets,” wrote Axl Rosenberg.
One of the very few to stick up for Anselmo was Adam Crosier of the Arkansas band Hymns, who are signed to Anselmo’s Housecore label.
“This slanderous attack against Phil Anselmo in the metal media right now is reaching a despicable level of ugly, inept judgment,” he wrote on his Facebook page. “There are no words that can accurately describe how false the racism claims truly are … I know, without a doubt, that Phil Anselmo is NOT racist. This accusation could not be further from the truth.”
Crosier told Blabbermouth: “I think he has just made some mistakes in the past and obviously at the Dimebash – which added together may paint an ugly picture of his personality. It’s very unfortunate, because he truly is a very compassionate and loving person.”"

Before Commontime was made, Field Music brothers Peter and David Brewis spent some time apart, working on solo projects or collaborations. It seems absence makes the creative juices flow faster, as their first release since 2012’s Plumb is perhaps their most accessible to date, without sacrificing any of their skewed pop vision.
“As much fun as we might have had on our own or collaborating, we missed just spending time in the studio, the two of us, trying things out together,” says David.
Watch Field Music's video for The Noisy Days Are Over Read more
Commontime is surprisingly funky – with shades of James Chance and Talking Heads – but it’s not just the music that has shifted its focus. Moving away from Plumb’s broader, more political subject matter, Field Music are now focusing on more domestic concerns: growing up, settling down, looking after family members and – on Stay Awake – the effect of late-night nappy changes on your relationship with your wife.
To those in the know, Field Music are one of the country’s most cherished alternative bands, and this album only serves to make that case stronger. Have a listen using the player below and let us know your thoughts.

From memories of art school days playing bass with a future Doctor Who to smuggling cameras into some of music’s most historically significant gigs, readers have shared some wonderfully hazy musical memories, backed up with the clarity that only photography can bring.
After the Guardian’s Music blog reported on a campaign to resurface “long lost” gig photos, we asked what historic gigs you’d been to with your camera, and received some fascinating images from long before these irritating, smartphone-waving times.
Some readers shared negatives that had never before seen the light of day, and some happily reminisced and regaled us with anecdotes they were telling for the 1,000th time.
Below are some of our favourite photographs and stories.
First, Tim Sinclair, now “an old git of 54”, who shared images from Manchester in the early 80s, including the one at the top of the page. Where else but the Haçienda and who other than New Order?

I saw almost all of New Order’s gigs at the Haçienda. I joined in the first week and am still member number 1,002 – though my card was confiscated when my mate used it to buy New Order tickets and it was out of date. These pictures are of their first gig there – I’d seen them at the Ritz in October 81 but was miles away from the stage. For this one I was about 10ft.
It was quite easy to take sharp photos of New Order in the early days as the audience didn’t move around much – it was long before ecstasy took over! I had to sneak my ancient SLR in under my jumper as photos weren’t allowed, though. Christ, I sound like my granddad, but those were great times – nobody gave a fuck and everyone was up for a good time.
New Order were often seen in the club just mingling and having a good night out like us punters – always up for a chat, too. One night I came back from the toilets to find Bernard Sumner in my seat chatting up my girlfriend! He jumped up and said sorry. I asked him what the band was up to and he said, cocking his head to the speakers: ‘We’ve just released our new single. In fact, this is it – first time it’s been played outside London.’
‘What’s it called?’ I asked.
‘Blue Monday.’
‘Fuck me. It’s a bit disco!’ I said, and he disappeared into the darkness.

Dean Weston was also witness to some music history, though he didn’t know it at the time:
I was a second-year undergraduate and occasional official concert photographer for the students’ union at Lancaster University when U2 played there on 2 March 1983. I have a confession to make: I didn’t know who the band were at the time, but took along a single roll of Ilford HP5 black and white film, shot all 36 exposures and hurried out halfway through, feeling somewhat unimpressed. Had I realised just how big U2 would become, I might have taken another roll.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bono and U2 at Lancaster University, 2 March 1983. Photograph: Dean Weston/GuardianWitness
I remember a lot of interaction between Bono and the audience – during tracks, between tracks. It seemed to be not so much U2 on stage as Bono’s backing band, to me.
How could I have known that they would become such a global phenomenon, and that to see them in their early days in a relatively small venue ought to have been something to relish?

This next photo [above], taken at a Public Image Ltd gig in December 1983, is one of those Cartier-Bresson ‘decisive moments’ for me. Definitely one of my better shots. I’d arrived late to the concert and had to rely on a long lens to shoot over the crowd, from the back of the great Hall, but nevertheless managed to capture a menacingly angelic John Lydon.
One of the most surprising stories we heard was this, from reader John Rogan.
I was at Glasgow School of Art with Peter Capaldi and we formed a band, the Bastards from Hell, with Roddy Murray in late 1978. We asked a friend, Iain McCaig, to play drums.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Dreamboys (L-R): Peter Capaldi, reader John Rogan, Roddy Murray and Iain McCaig. Photograph: John Rogan/GuardianWitness
Peter played guitar and sang, Roddy played guitar and bass, and I played bass and sang. Peter and I did swap around a bit as it was beyond both our musical abilities to sing and play at the same time. It was early, raw rock’n’roll with strong influences of Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, Buddy Holly and late 70s punk. We finished gigs off with [the Sex Pistols’] Pretty Vacant.
The gig photo [left] was taken by Peter’s friend Graham (I think), but I still have the contact sheet printed from his negatives. After this show – I think we were supporting Steel Pulse that night – we changed our name to the Dreamboys, and I played two more gigs with them in early 1979 (see the poster I designed, above).

Then, tragedy! Peter and Roddy decided I was ‘too scruffy’, ‘not stylish enough’ and ‘didn’t practise enough, either’ and I was unceremoniously kicked out of the band. They were right, by the way, on all three scores – I didn’t take it seriously. Temple Clark took my place and Robert Livsey took over on drums before Craig Ferguson: when Robert was drummer, the Dreamboys released a single, Bela Lugosi’s Birthday.
The Bastards from Hell played a reunion gig for a Glasgow Art School talent show in 1980 and Peter and Roddy kindly let me take lead vocals for two songs, The Twelfth of Never and Roddy’s We Eat Babies.
We came last.
The Who fan Mark Hesselink, who lives in Canada, says as a 16-year-old he thought he was witnessing history.
I was born in Rotterdam but grew up in the Toronto suburbs after coming here with my family in 1970. Like lots of kids my age, I fell in love with pop music, and when I was 13, I started going to concerts. I was captivated. I convinced my dad to lend me his camera and started taking pictures at shows in 1980, when I was 14. Going to shows was all about the spectacle. It was special, and taking pictures was a way for me to mark the experience and my presence. I photographed dozens and dozens of shows from about 1980 to about 1985 – the pictures are unpublished and mostly unseen.
As I got a bit older my interests changed: I became very involved with the early 80s post-punk hardcore scene. I continued to take pictures, but my camera turned away from the glamour of the rock stage and towards the dance floor and my friends.

I had been to see the Who early in October 1982 as part of the same ‘farewell tour’. It was the first time I saw them live and I had a really distant seat. And I thought that was it – but then they announced a couple of weeks later they would be doing their ‘final’ shows here in Toronto, at Maple Leaf Gardens, in December. I was able to get a good ticket for the last show on Friday 17 December. At the time there was so much anticipation; I was anxious that I wouldn’t be able to get my camera in to the show. We would be seeing the end of the Who.
They played. It was anticlimactic. They were good enough, but I didn’t feel the sense of loss I was expecting. And I didn’t think that any of the pictures I took were at all special, and didn’t represent how I felt about The Who or what they meant to me – except maybe this one picture of Pete Townshend.
Then there is Tim Richards, who moved in musical circles in Norwich.
As a university student in the late 70s who loathed my degree, I invested all of my spare money and too much of my time into my hi-fi, records and photography. I had a Russian Zenit camera, which was all I could afford – but being cheap it meant I could buy some lenses to go with it. I photographed everything around me: the brutalist University of East Anglia (UEA) architecture, the stalls in Norwich market, my friends, and above all the bands I saw. I don’t know why – it was just something I had to do. Saturdays were spent mooching around Norwich record and camera shops, and what money was left was spent on gig tickets and beer for the evening.
UEA was a place where bands would often do warm-up gigs before starting national tours, so we got to see all sorts. I would go along, camera in hand, hoping to take some good shots that I could perhaps sell, or that would help me make a break for art school or a career in photography. In this I was utterly unsuccessful.

I remember this Specials gig [above] as something of a landmark: a fresh, new, exciting style melding English and African-Caribbean fashion and music. Not only were cultures and genres mixing but [trombonist] Rico Rodriguez also bridged generations and brought a depth and authenticity to the music perhaps some of the other ska bands couldn’t muster. Their debut album had just been released, and an awareness of them and their fresh take on ska and the 2-Tone fashion meant there was a palpable anticipation of their arrival.
As well as students, there were plenty of young people from Norwich: everybody had been scrabbling around trying to find something appropriate to wear, including plenty of pork-pie hats

This picture of the Cure [above] was taken in the summer of 1979, not long after their first album was released. Hardly anybody knew who they were, and not many turned up to find out.
“I stopped taking music photographs in 1981, although I did manage to marry my interest in photography and my studies by using aerial photography and satellite imagery for mapping natural resources, and have spent most of my career since doing that.
Next, a splash of colour from 1980s and 90s Dire Straits superfan Tina Threadgill.

My friend Diane and I were fans who met through the pre-internet DSIS, the Dire Straits Information Service, which was run by Liz Whatley at the band’s London office, Damage Management. We had already paid a fortune for front-row seats to see the band in her hometown, San Diego, and now we were in LA, where I lived, for the two shows at the Great Western Forum. We had fifth-row seats for these shows, but we knew the Knopfler Rules: you could always take photos and rush the stage and get up close around the time the band plays Two Young Lovers – and security would let you without hassle. I borrowed a pretty expensive Olympus camera for the second night.
Liz found out how much we had spent on tickets from scalpers in California (hundreds of dollars, which was a lot then) and she must have felt sorry for us – so she put us on the guest list for the last ever concerts in the States that April, in Seattle and Portland. I’ll always be grateful to her for that. Those were the last concerts Diane and I saw together: I moved, we lost touch, and I heard she passed away.
The photos mean more to me than just long-lost pieces of paper in a drawer: they’re moments that remind me of a genuinely important time in my life. Sure, I go to Knopfler solo gigs now, here and there – and he’s still an amazing guitar player – but it’s not really the same.

An evening of fond renditions and recollections, and a lot of guitar tuning.
Graham Coxon: Bert Jansch's music is a great gift for everyone Read more
Graham Coxon had written beforehand of how nervous he was on meeting Jansch. The Blur guitarist looks twitchy here, too, as he performs an affectionate One for Jo and a “Bert-imbued” solo composition Latte, but returns later, much more at ease, for a tricksy twang on Angie together with Martin Simpson. Elsewhere before the interval we get songs from Jansch’s former fellow Pentanglers Jacqui McShee and Mike Piggott, and Jansch’s one-time mentor Archie Fisher doing Down by Blackwaterside – Jansch’s arrangement that he once famously accused Led Zeppelin of ripping off with Black Mountain Side.
Not one to bear a grudge, Robert Plant lends superstar magnetism to proceedings, backed by his superb five-piece band the Sensational Space Shifters. The opening notes of a whispered Babe I’m Gonna Leave You are met with an almost disbelieving collective intake of breath; his second set will end with an entrancingly amped-up Poison.

Plant’s is the heavyweight contribution, but the lighter touches shine brightest, such as Bernard Butler and Ben Watt’s shimmering electric guitar interplay on an opiated Soho. Scottish folk singer Karine Polwart jokes that she’s here for “equalities” reasons, but her mellifluous reading of Tree Song feels anything but tokenistic.

Its first two sections, the Fountains and Pines of Rome, have long been familiar individually, though the third, Roman Festivals, much criticised as extravagant, remains a rarity. A growing number of conductors, however, have shown themselves willing to tackle the whole cycle in a single evening, and Antonio Pappano has added his name to the list with a striking interpretation with the London Symphony Orchestra.
Pappano placed Roman Festivals first, giving an awesome performance that was in many ways revelatory. He made a virtue of its excess, letting rip with its violence and dwelling on its sensuality. Chords like hammer-blows greeted the victims of imperial brutality in the Circus Maximus. The lovers’ serenades in the warm autumn night glowed with gentle passion. Though we primarily think of Respighi as post-Romantic, this is in part a modernist score, indebted to Stravinsky: the tolling bells reminded us of Les Noces; the garish, ploy-thematic Epiphany fair sounded like Petrushka.
This was powerhouse stuff, but in its wake, Fountains of Rome seemed curiously cool despite its beauty and moments of grandeur. Pines of Rome, though, was gorgeous and a bit scary, superbly played, with ravishing string tone, the great clarinet solo in the Janiculum sequence exquisitely done by Chris Richards. The final march – the jury is still out on whether it has fascist overtones – was overpowering and unnerving.
The evening kicked off, however, with Rachmaninov’s Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. Technically adventurous though always assured, Lise de la Salle replaced the indisposed Alice Sara Ott as soloist, causing something of a sensation with her weighty, witty playing. Pappano’s conducting was wonderfully mercurial and precise, passionate yet unsentimental."

I first heard Ben Frost when I was in Mexico – we were both playing at Festival Mute. I was really impressed by his work and am still impressed by this whole record, Aurora – especially this piece. In a way this song is noise, but it has extremely interesting structures and sounds. And that’s why I like it.
Arca – Faggot
My next three picks are all records I have around at the moment and listen to because they are new; it is different to Ben Frost, in that he is something I discovered myself. I like Arca, he’s an interesting artist. He worked with Kanye West on Yeezus and with Björk, too. What he does is very strange.
Swans – Miracles of Love
Swans are a group I have known for quite a while and I just like them. My favourite album was To Be Kind, but this album … I just got it and listened to it. I really liked Miracles of Love; I like strange things, and this is very unusual.
Laibach – Eat Liver!
Laibach are also a totally strange group. I like Eat Liver! because on the one side it’s such a Balkan expression, of being furious, but it is so funny at the same time. I like their kind of very sinister humour.
Datenverarbeiter v Jaki Liebezeit – Opera
I chose this track because whatever Jaki Liebezeit [of Can] does, I find extremely interesting. I am always fascinated by how he turns a very minimal structure into a very complex groove. He is one of the greatest drummers ever. His minimalism at the same time is so complex; his rhythms fascinate me."
Adele|Donald Trump|Republicans|news,2016-02-01T20:39:35,guardian,Mark Tran|Amber Jamieson,"Record-breaking star joins long list of musicians – including Neil Young, REM and Aerosmith – who have asked presidential hopeful to leave their songs alone",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/01/adele-donald-trump-songs-campaign,Adele tells Donald Trump to stop pinching her songs for his campaign,en,culture|music,,"Record-breaking star joins long list of musicians – including Neil Young, REM and Aerosmith – who have asked presidential hopeful to leave their songs alone
Donald Trump may be a fan of Adele, but the pop star is no fan of the Republican presidential frontrunner.
The outspoken candidate, who is facing his first electoral test in the Iowa caucus, has been using Adele’s hits Rolling in the Deep and Skyfall, the singer’s James Bond theme, at his political rallies.
Trump’s appropriation of Adele’s music has perplexed some of her fans. One fan tweeted she was “offended on Adele’s behalf”, while another asked: “Does Adele know that Donald Trump plays her songs at his rallies? I have a feeling she would not be pleased.”
The property tycoon, who is known to millions of Americans through the US version of The Apprentice, annoyed many Adele fans when he jumped the queue at a concert she gave at the Radio City Music Hall in November.
Matt Bellassai (@MattBellassai) I can't believe Donald Trump got to walk right into the Adele concert and I'm still waiting in line @Adele fix it
Now the singer has become the latest pop star to tell Trump to stop pinching her tunes for his campaign.
“Adele has not given permission for her music to be used for any political campaigning,” her spokesman said.
That should come as no surprise to the Trump campaign. In 2011, Adele called David Cameron “a wally”, describing herself as a “Labour girl through and through”.
Neil Young and the Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler have also told Trump to stop using their music. Attorneys for Tyler sent a cease and desist letter to Trump’s campaign committee, which said Trump did “not have our client’s permission to use Dream On” or any of Tyler’s other songs and that it “gives the false impression that he is connected with, or endorses, Mr Trump’s presidential bid”.
REM’s Michael Stipe used more forthright language: “Go fuck yourselves, the lot of you – you sad, attention-grabbing, power-hungry little men. Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign,” he said in a statement after Trump used It’s the End of the World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine) at a rally.
But Steve Gordon, an entertainment lawyer and author of The Future of the Music Business, told the Guardian that in the US artists cannot do much to stop candidates playing their music.
Essentially, to play a recording of a song a political event the promoter simply gets a license from a licensing agent (either ASCAP, BMI or SESAC).
Because of US federal government laws, the licensing agent cannot deny a license to anyone who applies.
There are three things artists regularly try to sue for when their songs appear somewhere they don’t want, said Gordon: trademark infringement, right of publicity and unfair trade practises.
“If I, as a reasonable person, at a Trump or [Mike] Huckabee rally where Adele was played thought that Adele was endorsing the campaign she should have a cause of action,” said Gordon.
But Gordon added that simply playing a recording of a song did not count as a sufficient endorsement.
Plus, Adele declaring that she “has not given permission for her music to be used for any political campaigning” means that it’s even clearer to voters that she did not support him.
“If she’s coming out publicly against using her music, then she’s not endorsing him so no one would think she was. If I was his lawyer, he’s got a strong case, and she’s got a BS claim. If they tried to do anything legally … at the end of the day, she’d lose,” said Gordon.
Was there anything artists could do to make sure someone with completely different political views to them stays away from their music?
“Not really,” said Gordon."

The world’s largest and finest collection on the art of photography is to be created in London when more than 400,000 objects transfer from the National Media Museum (NMM) in Bradford to the Victoria and Albert Museum, in a move described as historic by both institutions.
Give photography the museum it deserves | Letters Read more
The bulk of the objects being moved are part of the Royal Photographic Society (RPS) collection, charting the invention and development of photography over 200 years. They include works by British photography pioneers William Henry Fox Talbot, who invented the negative/positive process for producing photographs, and Julia Margaret Cameron, known for her gorgeous, pre-Raphaelite-inspired portrait photography. The world’s first negative, daguerreotypes, early colour photographs and about 8,000 cameras will also be transferred, joining the V&A’s collection of 500,000 photographs.

Martin Barnes, the senior curator of photographs at the V&A, said putting the two collections together made “a huge amount of sense” and he paid tribute to the “clear thinking” of museum leaders.
“Having worked in national museums nearly my whole working life, it is really heartening to see national museums working together to look at where the collections are best placed,” Barnes said.
Works by American photographers such as Paul Strand, Alfred Stieglitz, Ansel Adams and Gertrude Käsebier will also be transferred to London.

“The quality is astounding,” said Barnes. “I’m sort of beside myself with excitement. My team and I are thinking: ‘What are the amazing things we can do by putting the two collections together?’ In terms of research, exhibitions, publications, access to the public, touring shows, conservation … it is a big project. It kickstarts a really exciting time for us, for photography.”
The 400,000 objects are coming from the 3m items in the NMM’s photography collection. The decision is part of a strategic shift by the NMM – which sailed perilously close to possible closure in 2013 – to focus on science, technology and the culture of light and sound.
Michael Pritchard, the director general of the RPS, said he welcomed the move, with one reservation: “From the perspective of the RPS collection, it is a good move in that it retains the integrity of the collection and will enhance public access.” But he said there is a concern in that there will no longer be a single institution acting as a national museum of photography, a role played by the NMM since its creation in 1983.
“Because of the breadth of photography, in that it covers science, technology and art, we think the story is told much better through a single institution able to deal with all of those. The art and science have worked hand in hand since 1839, when photography was invented, and you can’t really look at the art without the technology and vice versa.
“I hope and am sure it will be the case that the National Media Museum and V&A will work very closely together.”

For some images, the decision will be something of a reunion, in that they were once part of a single collection at the 19th-century South Kensington Museum before it divided into the V&A and the Science Museum.

For example, there are 60 negatives in the RPS collection by one of the first and perhaps the greatest amateur photographers, Benjamin Turner, which match positive prints in the V&A collection.
The V&A intends to create an international photography resource centre and double its permanent gallery space for photographs.
Ian Blatchford, the director of the NMM’s parent Science Museum Group, said: “Our two museums have a long and proud shared history and this decisions illustrates just how seriously we take our common mission to cherish and share the nation’s extraordinary cultural heritage.”
The NMM will retain collections that help explore the development of photographic processes, such as the Kodak collection; the cultural impact of photography, such as the Daily Herald archive; and archives that have a direct relevance to Bradford.
Martin Roth, the director of the V&A, said: “The V&A and Science Museum Group have shared origins and uniting our complementary collections will create a peerless historical and artistic photography resource.
“Our ambitious plans for enhancing digital access, collaborative research, touring exhibitions and creating an international photography resource centre will mean that future generations of visitors and researchers will benefit from these examples of the most important artistic developments in artistic photographic history.”"
Ballet|Dance|The National|Hans Christian Andersen|New York|features,2016-02-01T19:52:28,guardian,Marina Harss,"The 28-year-old dancer and choreographer’s latest work, inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen fairytale, marks an exciting return to narrative dance",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/01/justin-peck-national-bryce-dessner-most-incredible-thing-new-york-ballet,Justin Peck and the National's Bryce Dessner create a Most Incredible ballet,en,culture|stage,,"“Whosoever could do the most incredible thing was to have the king’s daughter and half of his Kingdom.” So begins The Most Incredible Thing, the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale that inspired Justin Peck’s most recent project, a new work for New York City Ballet. It’s a classic fairytale scenario: a kingdom and a contest, with a princess’s hand in the balance.
The 28-year-old, California-born choreographer, whose first dance dates back only eight years, has risen quickly to the top ranks of the American ballet scene. But New York City Ballet, where he is a soloist and choreographer-in-residence, is his home. The Most Incredible Thing, which opens as part of a mixed bill on Tuesday, will be his 10th work for the company. It is, however, the first time he has tried his hand at telling a story through dance.
It’s not surprising that he hasn’t gone down the narrative path before, given that his entire career has taken place under the long shadow of George Balanchine, the co-founder of City Ballet and its affiliated school. Balanchine is best known for works like Agon and Concerto Barocco that did away with characters, plot, sets, and conventional costumes. As he repeatedly proved, music and steps could create their own compelling stories.
For a time after his death in 1983, especially in the United States, it seemed as if narrative ballet had gone permanently out of fashion. In addition to everything else, articulating a series of events without words is no easy task. As the professor of dance history and criticism Mindy Aloff recently put it, “it’s very hard to devise the step-by-step logic to tell a story coherently. You’re working on several levels: the narrative and gestural logic of the story, the formal logic of the choreography.”
The classic story ballets, like Swan Lake and Giselle, used detailed mime to explain whatever couldn’t be illustrated through dancing. But the language of mime is something of a lost art. Some choreographers have managed all the same. Frederick Ashton found his own silent language, a mixture of pure movement and evocative gesture, in ballets like Fille Mal Gardée and A Month in the Country. More contemporary choreographers such as Matthew Bourne, Christopher Wheeldon and Alexei Ratmansky have developed their own ways to convey plot and emotion. Bourne prefers a naturalistic approach, while Wheeldon has opted for a more stylized palette. Ratmansky is somewhere in the middle.
In fact, as these names suggest, story ballets have begun to make something of a comeback. (“It goes in waves,” Ratmansky told me a few years ago.) Which brings us back to Peck and The Most Incredible Thing. Interestingly, the young choreographer didn’t set out to make a narrative work, but as he began to discuss possibilities with his collaborators – the composer Bryce Dessner (also guitarist with the National) and visual artist Marcel Dzama – the idea took shape. Given his past experience with the company, Peck finally felt ready: “I’ve built up to a point where I really understand the institution,” he says, “all the departments and how they interact with each other.” The challenge, then, is to find the right story.
The Andersen tale, only about two pages long, is, in many ways, a perfect vehicle for such a project: short, relatively straightforward, and loaded with images. “It’s not like we’re translating Shakespeare,” Peck says with a laugh. It’s about a young man who wins a contest by inventing a clock which, on the hour, produces lifelike figures. As they emerge, they re-enact various scenes: Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, the muses, the seasons. Each scene offers the perfect excuse for a dance, a kind of tableau vivant with movement.

But the tale also contains a darker message. Just as the young inventor is about to claim his prize, a rival appears and smashes everything to bits, arguing that his act of destruction is, in itself, an extraordinary feat. “It felt very relevant to our time,” said Peck, “when terrorists are destroying great works of art. I think it contains an important message about how art can be fleeting and ephemeral. That ephemerality is a big part of dance, as well.” (Coincidentally, the story was also made into a ballet five years ago at Sadlers Wells in London with choreography by Javier de Frutos and music by the Pet Shop Boys.)
The one-act ballet opens with a soliloquy by the protagonist, portrayed on alternating nights by the dancers Taylor Stanley and Tyler Angle. It includes a bit of mime, some of it recognizable from 19th-century works like Swan Lake. There are nods to other ballets, as well, a pas de deux reminiscent of Sleeping Beauty, a sunburst pattern that recalls Balanchine’s Apollo, a whiff of Firebird. Peck has snuck in a more obscure homage, to the early 20th-century modern dancer Loie Fuller, known for her use of billowing garments, which fluttered and swirled around her when she danced. But, for all its gestures toward the past, the ballet is very recognizably a work of the present, fast-paced, streamlined, full of oblique movement and fluid patterns that morph seamlessly from one shape to the next. Men partner men, women partner women, and not a minute is wasted.
Such economy was possible because of the closeness of the collaboration between Peck and his designer (Dzama) and composer (Dessner). Dzama, a Canadian artist whose work includes dreamlike drawings and dioramas populated by tiny figures arranged in dance-like poses, cites the early 20th-century avant-gardists Francis Picabia and Oskar Schlemmer as influences. (Both artists designed for the ballet stage.) “My drawings are like little stages,” he recently told a reporter. It is his first ballet; in fact, before meeting Peck he had never even been to the ballet.

In addition to founding the National, Dessner also composed for the score to The Revenant. He is also a collector of folk melodies, which often find their way into his work. The score for The Most Incredible Thing, his second collaboration with Peck, includes two of these, traditional Scandinavian tunes which he has blended into the orchestral texture. (One, a Danish wedding song, can be heard during the first extended pas de deux between the Creator and the Princess.) The three creators worked together intensively over the course of 18 months, developing a treatment of the story and exchanging ideas via Skype, email, and dinners. Says Dessner: “We thought about how long each movement would be, the musical ideas that might work, the musical language; it was extremely collaborative.” Many ideas were thrown out along the way, including Dzama’s suggestion that some of the dancers wear masks – which they ultimately deemed too distracting and too hard to dance in.
Out of this collaboration came 43 minutes of music, two colorful backdrops, and a vast array of fantastical costumes – including one that is meant to be worn by two dancers at once. There will be 56 people onstage, including 11 kids from the company school. Many of them will carry props, which present their own choreographic challenges. “I had to learn how to partner with one hand,” Amar Ramasar, whose character, the destroyer, carries a club, said recently at a preview at the Guggenheim Museum.
This is one of the most elaborate productions the New York City Ballet has undertaken in the last decade, and one of the most expensive. (Another reason why companies are often wary of story ballets: they cost a lot of money.) It’s a gamble, but one with a potentially big reward. The thing is, people like stories.
“It’s about that moment in any artist’s life when he has to take a risk and put his idea out there,” Peck said of Andersen’s tale at a preview of the ballet at the Guggenheim. He could just as easily have been talking about himself."

NatashaFatale earned all our admiration by finishing Anatoly Rybakov’s Stalin trilogy, “which is basically a single 1800-page novel. That sounds daunting but it isn’t at all”:
Yevtushenko said of one the books that it reads like a detective story, and that’s exactly right. Not in that it’s a mystery – how could it be? – but in that it moves like a very good one. It fairly races along. So if you could see yourself reading six good mysteries in a row ... I stayed lucky with Peter Brown’s The Ransom of the Soul. It simply never occurred to me before how much early Christianity had in common with the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Could have used an editor in a couple of places; the defects are minor but the writing would be near-perfect if they’d been caught, so I grumble.

We saw lots of Steinbeck chat, including annieohoh’s praise for East of Eden:
I have always steered clear of Steinbeck, however, for my book club, I am reading ‘East of Eden’. Just love it. Only half way through, but what a book! The writing about the human condition speaks to me in many ways. My favourite characters so far are Samuel and Lee. Philosophers and boy, do they think! PS. Never seen the film and I don’t want to.
Jenny Bhatt is reading Seneca’s Letters from a Stoic and coming to interesting present-day conclusions:
Don’t ask me why. I just felt like I needed some of that kind of no-nonnsense advice to start 2016. He writes in epigrams mostly, which can get tiring. And, when he starts railing against the luxury of bathroom fixtures, it does get a bit much. But, for the most part, a lot of what he says is good advice for any age. You take what applies to you. I did enjoy, very much, what he had to say about friendship – a very different concept to how we approach it these days. And, I wondered how he would have responded to social media friendships – they would have faced a rant worse than bathroom fixtures, I think.
VelmaNebraska recommended Lauren Beukes’s Zoo City, “a sassy and innovative, dirty and sparkly novel set in an alternative contemporary South Africa”:
Her protagonist, Zinzi December, is one of the “animalled” who live in the eponymous slum – this means that she did something bad enough in her past to be mysteriously tethered with a psychic connection to an animal for the rest of her life (in her case, a sloth). This is a thriller with magic, and great fun to read. While the narrative itself is sometimes choppy and left me slightly stranded at times, trying to figure out what exactly was going on and how we suddenly got here, the characters and settings and scenarios are fantastically drawn.

Classical music|London Philharmonic Orchestra|Vladimir Jurowski|reviews,2016-02-01T14:28:20,guardian,Martin Kettle,"Beethoven’s Sixth was beautifully played, outshining the debut of Alexander Raskatov’s Green Mass – which had less to say and took longer to say it.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/01/lpo-vladimir-jurowski-review-raskatov-green-mass-royal-festival-hall-london,LPO/Jurowski review - green Raskatov eclipsed by pastoral Beethoven,en,culture|music,,"On the face of it, and depending on how much you consider music to be a bearer of ideas, this might have been a fascinating compare-and-contrast concert. In the first half, Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony, a hymn to nature and life. In the second, the world premiere of Alexander Raskatov’s Green Mass, an extended reflection on our generation’s continuing sins against the natural world.
The trouble was that the comparison worked so lopsidedly in Beethoven’s favour. Before the interval, Vladimir Jurowski conducted a historically informed performance of the Pastoral in the modern manner, fewer than 60 players, avoidance of vibrato, with valveless trumpets and double basses at the back. The London Philharmonic played it beautifully, the string sound in Beethoven’s figurations clean and compelling throughout.
Raskatov’s mass, which took up the second half of the evening, took a lot longer, with far more players and singers, to say a good deal less, and with nothing approaching Beethoven’s levels of innovation or musical concentration. Jurowski held the piece together efficiently, but his players appeared unconvinced by a lot of what they were doing, and the vocal soloists, marooned behind the orchestra, struggled to engage, even though microphones were in evidence. It says a lot for the quartet of Elena Vassilieva, Iestyn Davies, Mark Padmore and Nikolay Didenko, as well as the choir of Clare College, Cambridge, that they succeeded as often as they did.
The mass is structured in ways that evoke Britten’s War Requiem, with the sections of the Latin service interspersed by poetry, in this case in five languages, on the theme of nature, but without the benefit of Britten’s unifying artistic tact. It didn’t help, either, that the texts were not printed in the programme, although translations were projected on a screen. Raskatov’s setting is stylistically eclectic and rarely settled. Musical ideas and effects came and went, without much development, some arresting, others not, many derivative. There were passages of noisy rhythmic force in the Credo and the setting for the quartet of St Francis’s prayer to the accompaniment of wind chimes was a moment of originality. But the sound of audience footsteps leaving before the end was, presumably, not in the score."
Games|Indie games|PC|Game culture|features,2016-02-01T09:37:05,guardian,Nathan Ditum,How a small team set out to tell an intimate personal drama within the vastness of the Yellowstone National Park,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/01/firewatch-american-wilderness-campo-santo,Firewatch: hope and heartbreak in the American wilderness,en,culture|games,,"The outdoors in Firewatch isn’t like the outdoors in most games. It feels somehow bigger. This is a game set in Wyoming’s Yellowstone national park, a vast wilderness of lakes, mountains and hiking trails. When the sun began to set on my first day in the park – as the lead protagonist Henry, the volunteer fire lookout – it reminded me of rushing home at dusk while playing out as a kid, of escaping the dark as a small person in a big world.
This is all very deliberate. Firewatch is a relatively small and simple game, designed to engage players emotionally with a handful of basic, believable parts. It comes from a new studio, Campo Santo, though its dozen members have worked on lots of other games at various other studios. The lead artist, Jane Ng, worked on The Cave at Double Fine, while the writer/director pair, Sean Vanaman and Jake Rodkin, led the team behind the hugely acclaimed first season of The Walking Dead at Telltale Games.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Firewatch Photograph: Campo Santo
Campo Santo exists partly because of The Walking Dead. After its success, then-flatmates Vanaman and Rodkin realised if they didn’t strike out on their own at that moment they probably never would. The Walking Dead had given them experience of leading a team, and after 10m sales, games publishers were keen to talk business. There were offers, too, some for more money than they needed, but the pair were looking for an unusual level of creative control. Too much money, says Vanaman, comes with “too many meetings.”
In the end Campo Santo went into business with Panic, Inc, a software company from Oregon, better known for its FTP clients and MP3 players. This will be Panic’s first game, an unlikely departure which the company agreed to in part because of what Vanaman describes as an existing “personal, professional relationship.” Rodkin interrupts: “Let’s be honest about this professional connection, Sean. I made skins for their MP3 player when I was in college.”

It all adds to the slightly unusual mix. Campo Santa seems a particular kind of place – with creative control written into its contract, the studio is happy to be completely open with its publisher (Panic has access to the team’s internal Slack chat) and development has been, if not without the odd bump, at least unfettered. The British artist Olly Moss, a friend of Rodkin and Vanaman, came on board early, and his artwork helped to explain the project to other prospective members of the team. They were looking for experienced developers who recognised the risk of a start-up (“If anyone ever said ‘This sounds perfect!’ I would stop them,” says Vanaman “It will not be perfect.”) and though there were some fixed ideas about the game Firewatch would eventually become, it was also shaped by who else joined the studio. “You design by hiring, sometimes” says Vanaman.
What Firewatch became is a first-person game primarily about exploration and story, rather than action or combat, nudging at the edges of a genre established by games like Dear Esther and Gone Home. Firewatch is not really about watching for fires, but what happens to Henry when his life reaches a point where the isolation of a lookout tower makes more sense than anything else. It’s a narrative game, with a mystery to unravel, though little is known beyond the fact that Henry finds evidence that something strange is going on out there. Deepening the interactivity of the experience are classic adventure game-style mechanics (picking up, inspecting and using items) and the game’s dialogue options, something carried over from Vanaman’s work on The Walking Dead. As Ng points out, at this level of production, and for a studio’s first game, it makes sense “to do what you’re good at.”

In Firewatch these dialogue options shape what is, along with the American wilderness, another of the game’s key fixtures - the relationship between Henry and his unseen, distant supervisor, Delilah. Actually they start before that, in a text-only prologue sequence that, in a few economical minutes, establishes the reason Henry has volunteered for the Forest Service, devastates the player emotionally in a confoundingly straightforward way, and makes that first breath of mountain air seem like welcome escape from a decade-long slide into shadow.
It works. We totally get why Henry needs this job, why he’s quiet, and why the friendly Delilah – who he contacts via walkie-talkie and is his only contact with HQ and the world – is so appealing to him (and to us).
Vanaman stresses the importance of naturalistic writing to this kind of investment, with which he wants to “play on your emotions as an actual person.” Firewatch’s drama is all the more compelling precisely because its parts are unremarkable. There’s that feeling of the outdoors, the lack of a safety net afforded by streetlights and civilisation (there are no mobile phones in Firewatch’s 1989, and all in-game navigation is done with map and compass). And there’s the comfort and precariousness of the relationship with Delilah, who gains a certain power from being Henry’s only point of contact. The walkie-talkie through which they communicate is the focus of the game’s interaction, with Henry reporting objects and observations to her. She becomes his world - a subtle, human feeling of dependence that can easily shift into vulnerability (at one point I choose an undiplomatic response and Delilah steps away from her walkie-talkie, leaving me bereft).
Delilah and the walkie-talkie weren’t always this central. At one point, Ng says, Henry was going to interact with various people – other hikers, for example – but in terms of resources and time, having other characters physically appear in your game is “really expensive”. The realisation seems similar to that of UK developer The Chinese Room which adopted an equally lonely setting for its own rural drama, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture.
Without physical interaction, Campo Santo re-focused on what was really important, a process of design by subtraction. “Sometimes when you accept your constraints completely, and design within them, you forget whether it was the constraint or the idea that drove it first,” says Vanaman. Henry and Delilah’s relationship now seems to be “what this is fundamentally about.”
Because of this, finding a voice for Henry was always going to be crucial. It’s not enough for the dialogue to read realistically, Vanaman says, it’s got to be spoken that way, too. The team drew up a wishlist of names, some based on the notion that the actor should resemble Henry physically - a stocky, Fred Flinstone type - and somewhere near the top was Mad Men’s Rich Sommer. Sommer, it turned out, is a big fan of board games, and followed Campo Santo’s programmer Patrick Ewing - who runs a blog about board games - on twitter. “Patrick said ‘I could just DM him…’” remembers Ng. He came in and impressed. “He’s energetic, interesting, fun to be around,” says Vanaman, who laughs about the sadsack on-screen image Sommer gained from Mad Men. “In street clothes, he’s the best-looking guy in the room.”
Vanaman and another member of the team, Nels Anderson, grew up in different parts of Wyoming, and there’s a glow of nostalgia to the game’s toasted sunsets, its stylised, airbrushed past. But setting Firewatch somewhere real and specific also made the storytelling easier, Vanaman says, and to help the team grasp the size and character of Yellowstone Campo Santo took a work field trip to the much closer Yosemite National Park. Rodkin says it was incredibly useful, especially for members of the team who hadn’t grown up in the States. Yosemite had a lookout tower built from the same blueprint as Henry’s in the game, and the trip become a contrast of scales - the huge space of the park, and the tiny details and objects it contained. It was this trip which brought home the sort of space in which the game took place, and helped shape that feeling of the somehow bigger.
“We had the most cheesy movie moment, like if there was a documentary crew filming the making of Firewatch,” Rodkin says. “It was Olly sitting on the railing looking out into the middle of nowhere. And he said: ‘I get it’”
Firewatch is released on Linux, Mac, PC and PS4 on 9 February."

Sarah Ryman, a mother of two school-age children, is well aware of the high cost of going on holiday at peak times. “We would typically have to spend about £3,000 on an all-inclusive week’s holiday abroad in the summer, and we can’t afford to do that every year,” said the marketing consultant from Brighton.
Her experience echoes that of many parents for whom an affordable break during the school holidays is a pipedream. There may be some relief in sight for Sarah and her husband Rob, as Brighton and Hove city council is considering adapting the school term timetable to make holidays cheaper for local families. The city’s schools are now being informally consulted about the best way to do this.
The cost of holidays varies hugely between the weeks when children are in school and the weeks when they have their half-term and summer holidays – in some cases by more than 150%, according to a survey by The Observer.
A week’s holiday for a family of four in a two-bed apartment in the Spanish island of Gran Canaria costs £2,777 during the February half-term – compared with £1,102 for the same apartment a week earlier. A ski break in the French Alps will come in at £2,432 for half-term, but a week earlier the price is just £1,000. In the UK a two-bed woodland lodge in the Center Parcs resort of Whinfell Forest, Cumbria, is priced at £1,628 for the week beginning 12 February, but only £878 the previous week – an increase of 85%.
The sharp difference in prices means that holidays are simply not within the budget of some families – prompting calls for more flexible school holidays. A recent survey of parents by Halifax found that almost one in four can’t afford a summer holiday at all.
In Brighton, one option under consultation is to coordinate “inset” days (school training days which take place on dates decided by the council) into a block to create a long weekend, or even a full week’s break, at a time when holidays are less expensive, perhaps in March. Another option is to reduce the summer break and create an additional “stand alone” week’s holiday, potentially during October or November.
“I often hear people saying the six-week summer holiday is too long and also that the autumn term is too long,” councillor Tom Bewick said.
If schools are amenable to the council’s idea, more concrete consultations with schools and parents will then begin, with a final decision expected in the summer.
The news was welcomed by the Department for Education, along with Abta, the travel association, which for years has been calling for local authorities in different regions of the UK to spread out school holidays.

“At the moment, parents are a captive market, driving demand for breaks during the school holidays, which in turn pushes up prices,” said Sean Tipton, an Abta spokesman. “Stagger the school holidays and you spread demand. That will enable parents to take advantage of cheaper prices.”
Under the current structure, academies, foundation, voluntary aided and foundation special schools have the power to set their own term dates, while local authorities are responsible for setting term dates for community and voluntary controlled schools.
Council considers cutting summer break to let families have autumn holidays Read more
“We encourage local authorities to listen sympathetically to arguments for changes to term dates,” a spokesperson for the Department for Education said.
However, Tipton says an ad hoc approach by individual schools and councils is not the solution. “Stagger school holidays in a structured way by region – as they do in Germany – and the date changes are less likely to be a problem for parents who work at different local schools to the ones their children attend, and also parents with one child at primary school and another at secondary school. It would also enable local airlines to ensure enough aircraft are available at local airports.”
Craig Langman, chairman of campaigning group Parents Want a Say, is against staggering school holidays. “Many parents cannot simply take time off work during allocated school holiday periods. They need the flexibility to take the children out of school for up to 10 days a year, at time that suits their work schedule.”
If demand for family holidays becomes more strategically spread out across the year it is also likely to increase off-peak prices for other travellers, Tipton admitted. “You can’t win, can you? But those travellers would then have the option of going away in July and August for less.”
Kate Stinchcombe-Gillies, an independent travel industry commentator, thinks staggering school holidays by regions wouldn’t have a significant impact on current off-peak prices.
“The peak-season price period might get slightly longer, with an overall reduction in low season weeks.”
Sarah and Rob Ryman would welcome any move to spread out the school holidays and make them cheaper for families.
Should parents take their children on holiday during term time? Read more
“I estimate we’d save at least £1,000 a year if the council created a week’s holiday at an off-peak time,” Sarah said.
“Parents have less money than people without kids – it would be fairer if demand were more spread out. Plus, travelling abroad and experiencing different cultures is such an important educational experience for children,” Sarah added.
“We’re self-employed, and sometimes we’ve had to take the kids on holiday during term-time, when it’s cheaper and fits in with our businesses. We did this when we went to Australia to visit my sister, and saved £1,500 on the flights alone. We should have paid a £240 fine but, luckily, our school didn’t report us.”
WHAT THE LAW SAYS
Guidance from the Department for Education, issued to schools since September 2013, states headteachers no longer have any discretion to approve absences of up to 10 days a year in “special circumstances”.
Unless it is under “exceptional circumstances”, such as a funeral, each parent who deliberately takes a child out of school during term time can be fined £60 by their local council.
This means a family of four - two parents, taking two children out of school - faces a potential fine of £240. This must be paid within 21 days, or it doubles.
According to www.gov.uk, the official government website, you may be prosecuted if you don’t pay the fine after 28 days.
However, Huw Lewis, the Welsh education minister, has written to all local education authorities in Wales, advising them that blanket bans on term-time holidays are contrary to Welsh education regulations, emphasising that headteachers can still legally exercise their discretion in relation to authorising absences for up to 10 days per year.
In October, a father who refused to pay the fine allowed his case to go to court, risking a criminal record. He was prosecuted under Section 444 of the Education Act 1996, which states that parents are liable for the fine if their children fail to “attend regularly at school”, but successfully argued that taking a child out of school for a single week did not mean he had broken the law. The ruling, however, did not set a legal precedent.

Meet three beneficiaries of the new green economy from Zambia, Pakistan and Kenya
While the price of oil is plummeting, taking with it a significant number of jobs, the renewable energy job market is booming. It is estimated that it will grow to 24m jobs worldwide by 2030 – up from 9.2m reported in 2014 – according to analysis by the International Renewable Energy Industry (Irena), which predicts that doubling the proportion of renewables in the global energy mix would increase GDP by up to $1.3tn across the world.
The rise and rise of the solar industry has been the largest driver of growth. In 2014, it accounted for more than 2.5m jobs, largely in operations, maintenance and manufacturing – now increasingly dominated by a jobs boom in Asia.
The industry is providing hope and income to workers – present and future – across the global south.
Sheila Mbilishi, ‘solar-preneur’, Zambia
Although employment in renewable energy is comparatively low across Africa, the sunny continent is where the need and potential for employment is perhaps greatest. A fast-growing economy and population is driving demand for energy, but two-thirds of people in sub-Saharan Africa still lack access to electricity.
Now the renewables revolution is witnessing the rise of a generation of African “solar-preneurs” who are creating small-scale businesses by taking solar energy – in the form of lights, radios and mobile-phone charging facilities – into local communities.
Solar is bringing a new world to women in Zimbabwe Read more
In western Zambia, Sheila Mbilishi is self-employed and sells solar lights to local residents and businesses. The 67-year-old widow and mother of six buys the lights for $5 from the social enterprise SunnyMoney – part of the UK based charity SolarAid – and sells them on with a 50% profit margin.
“They sell like cupcakes,” says Mbilishi. “There is life in the lights – people got interested in them.” They are popular with pupils who want to study after dark, businesses during electricity blackouts or as a replacement for toxic kerosene lamps in homes.
Since starting the business three years ago, it has provided Mbilishi with a significant source of income, helping her to open a shop and build a two-bedroom flat. “The difference is huge,” she says. “Selling lights has helped me a lot. I have built a house out of the lights. Owning personal ones has helped me too with the current load shedding – electricity is usually off and I am not affected by no light.”
Shehak Sattar, renewable energy student, Moscow
For Shehak Sattar, choosing to study renewable energy was more a social than a personal decision. “I want to practise something different from the mainstream. It is related to the concept of believing in humanity and our survival on earth,” he says.

The 27-year-old Pakistani student is now four months into a masters degree in the science and materials of solar energy at the National University of Science and Technology in Moscow, funded by a scholarship. The course is in its first year and has mostly attracted international students – from Afghanistan and Iran to Nigeria and Namibia.
Before coming to Moscow, Sattar worked for NGOs and other agencies in Pakistan, installing and spreading the transmission of solar energy to remote communities and to slums in Islamabad and Lahore. Larger solar projects are now starting to come online in Pakistan, amid ambitions to construct the world’s largest solar farm.
“There has been a general electricity crisis in Pakistan. People are waiting for alternatives to rescue them from this suffering,” he says.
Once he has completed his course, Sattar wants to work at a university in Pakistan “to convert the attention of students to renewable energy sources” by lecturing and researching methods to make solar energy more efficient.
“We have to fight more,” he says. “We have to fight against the people who will be digging for petroleum in the coming 20 years because it will destroy our ecology’s balance.”
Mohamed Abdikadir, solar panel installer, Dadaab, Kenya
The promise of renewable energy in refugee camps could save humanitarian agencies hundreds of millions of dollars and provide job opportunities for thousands of young refugees.
Mohamed Abdikadir, 21, was born in the refugee camp complex at Dadaab in eastern Kenya, where the average family spends $17.20 per month – 24% of their income – on energy. The complex is home to more than 330,000 refugees.
Like most of his neighbours, Abdikadir’s family came to the camp after fleeing the civil war in Somalia more than two decades ago. Both his parents have since died, leaving Abdikadir to provide for his 10 younger siblings. He is now one of 5,000 young people trained to install solar panels as part of a programme in Kenya and Ethiopia organised by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), which has recruited local teachers to deliver it.

“It was hard [to learn] at first but I tried my best and now it is easy,” says Abdikadir. After completing a six-month programme a year ago, he gets up at 5am every day to pray before preparing breakfast and collecting the tools for his job in Dadaab’s dry desert landscape. “There is a lot of sun here. Renewable energy is very good in this environment.”
Before he started the programme, Abdikadir earned money by selling water but he could only make enough to provide one meal a day for his family. Now, with the extra income from solar installations – $10 on an average day – his siblings are eating three meals daily, have new clothing and are able to attend a fee-paying school.
“I am the breadwinner of the family,” he says. “[The programme] has really helped me. Before I was idle. It helps with my daily bread, my daily income.”
Abdikadir now wants to expand his education to incorporate other forms of renewable energy. Meanwhile, the NRC recently announced plans to deliver a similar programme on a larger scale for Syrians at Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan.

The development of tidal lagoon schemes has received a boost with a commitment of millions of pounds to the technology in the UK and India.
The investment by the Gupta family, thought to be around £10m, will give it a substantial stake in Tidal Lagoon Plc, a holding company set up to finance the development of full-scale tidal lagoons to generate clean power in the UK and abroad.
It comes as Tidal Lagoon Power Ltd, which set up Tidal Lagoon Plc, awaits a government decision on subsidies for the world’s first lagoon project in Swansea Bay, a proof-of-concept scheme to harness renewable energy from the power of the tides.
Last month, the prime minister, David Cameron, said his enthusiasm for tidal lagoon technology was “reduced” by the costs.
But Tidal Lagoon Power argues the first project in Swansea Bay would open the way for five other schemes around the coast, with lower costs due to economies of scale, that could meet 8% of the UK’s electricity demand for 120 years.
Proposed schemes at Cardiff and Newport would provide around 4GW of power capacity and generate £10bn of capital investment, the company said.
The move by the Gupta family is part of a wider strategy by its global energy and commodities company SIMEC to develop renewable energy worldwide, and use innovative technologies to provide low-cost power to energy-intensive industries including steel.
Gupta family representative Sanjeev Gupta said: “We are very pleased to invest in this ambitious and innovative enterprise that promises to provide low-carbon, baseload energy and drive economic renewal through the development of a high-value supply chain that will create thousands of new jobs.”
The move will also lead to the creation of a joint venture between SIMEC and Tidal Lagoon Power to develop large-scale tidal lagoons in India, with the first feasibility studies carried out in the Gulf of Khambhat, Gujurat, in western India."

The government has made it a “top priority” to ensure protections for national parks and sites of special scientific interest do not obstruct fracking across the country, according to a leaked letter from ministers.
Fracking in both protected areas was ruled out by the government last year, in the Infrastructure Act, although campaigners pointed out that companies could still drill vertically outside park boundaries and then horizontally beneath them.
But it appears ministers are working to ensure that even those limited protections do not get in the way of fracking companies.
“One of our top priorities will be to examine what work is required to ensure that the safeguarding provisions in the [Infrastructure] Act do not inadvertently create fresh barriers to exploration and to minimise the delays that the requirements in the act have introduced,” three ministers wrote to the chancellor, George Osborne.
The letter, dated 7 July 2015 and signed by Liz Truss, the environment secretary; Amber Rudd, the energy secretary; and Greg Clark, the communities secretary, was obtained by Friends of the Earth.
It shows that just days before the government laid draft regulations for the protections in parliament, with ministers on 16 July promising “world-class environmental protections”, they were privately saying they would work to ensure they did not cause problems for industry. The regulations were later passed in December.
Tony Bosworth, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Even before ministers had published the regulations supposedly protecting our most beautiful landscape and wildlife sites from fracking, they were writing that it was a priority to make sure this didn’t hamper or delay the industry. The government’s public line is very different to its private view.”
A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: “We have the right protections in place to ensure that fracking can go ahead safely without risk to our most beautiful and important natural sites, while striking the necessary balance to ensure that this vital industry can develop.”
The letter also revealed that ministers are considering designating shale gas wells as “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, which would take planning decisions out of the hands of local authorities, to be made by officials at the Infrastructure Planning Commission instead.
However, the three ministers admit that introducing such a change before exploratory wells are drilled and shown to be safe, could undermine public support for shale.
Shadow energy secretary, Lisa Nandy, said: “These latest revelations show that ministers are intent on imposing fracking on communities against their will, regardless of the consequences for the environment. Government should act in the interests of the whole country, not just the fracking industry.”
Pat Davies, chair of the anti-fracking Preston New Road Action Group, said: “This latest travesty from Westminster seems to be an attempt to predetermine outcomes in relation to fracking, irrespective of local community wishes.”
Last year shale gas explorer Cuadrilla suffered a major blow when Lancashire county council rejected fracking at Preston New Road and Roseacre Wood, near Blackpool, leading ministers to later promise they would “fast track” fracking applications. Cuadrilla’s subsequent appeal will be heard next week.
A separate decision on a fracking application by Third Energy at Kirby Misperton, a village in Ryedale, North Yorkshire, was due on 9 February but has been delayed until March at the earliest after North Yorkshire council asked the company for more information.
“We continue to endeavour to meet the earliest planning committee meeting we can for a determination,” the council said in a statement.
The government letter shows that ministers hope for exploratory fracking wells to be up and running by 2017, with production following by 2020 and a “maturing industry” established by 2025. Just one exploratory shale gas well has been fracked in the UK so far, at Preese Hall, Lancashire, in 2011."

Seven in 10 landlords do not understand their obligations under controversial new “right to rent” rules that oblige them to check new tenants’ immigration statuses.
The laws that come into force on Monday could cause problems for young tenants and the less well-off, experts say. They could also put landlords at risk of being accused of discrimination.
From 1 February, landlords who let property in England will have to carry out checks to make sure potential tenants have the right to rent property in the UK. The scheme, which was piloted in the West Midlands, is being introduced as part of the government’s drive to “create a hostile environment for illegal migrants”.
Anyone who breaks the rules and is found to be letting a home to a tenant who is not allowed to stay can be fined up to £1,000 the first time, and £3,000 subsequently.
The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) said its members faced a difficult choice: they could “take a restrictive view with prospective tenants, potentially causing difficulties for the 12 million UK citizens without a passport” or “target certain individuals to conduct the checks, opening themselves up to accusations of racism”.
Right to rent scheme to be extended nationwide from February Read more
Although the national rollout of the scheme was announced in October, the RLA said more than 90% of 1,500 landlords it surveyed had not received any information from the government about this new legal duty, and 72% did not understand their obligations.
Landlords are allowed to accept a number of documents as proof, including passports, but the RLA said 44% had indicated they would only accept documents that were familiar to them. This could cause problems to people without passports.
Dr David Smith, policy director at the RLA, said: “The government argues that its ‘right to rent’ plans form part of a package to make the UK a more hostile environment for illegal immigrants. The evidence shows that it is creating a more hostile environment for good landlords and legitimate tenants.”
He added: “Landlords are damned if they do and damned if they don’t.”
Under the rules, landlords are expected to check documents with their tenants and ensure that the documents are originals and belong to the tenant and that the dates for the tenant’s right to stay in the UK have not passed.
If a tenant’s permission to stay is time-limited, landlords can be fined if they do not make further checks before the expiry date or 12 months after the first check.
Why does Theresa May think landlords would make good immigration officers? | Jonn Elledge Read more
Nicola Thivessen, head of compliance at Chestertons estate agency in London, said for landlords and lettings agents who kept good records the checks “shouldn’t add a huge burden to the process of securing a tenancy”.
However, she said there could be problems for landlords who did not fully understand the rules.
“As some landlords are likely to feel that the new legislation is a bureaucratic minefield, they may think they can play safe by only renting to British people. This is absolutely not the case, as this is tantamount to discrimination,” she said.
“As a professional agency we are legally obliged to ‘dis-instruct’ landlords for discriminatory or racist behaviour, but in reality those who are rejected or overlooked for tenancies by landlords using less scrupulous agents or advertising directly through classified ads for instance may have a hard time proving they have been discriminated against.”
Tenants could also suffer if they were not able to provide the right paperwork. “Some of the most vulnerable people in the private rented sector may be forced to turn to the black economy to find a place to live. Someone who is homeless, for instance, may not hold a passport or visa; and obtaining one may be difficult, not to say costly, for someone living on the streets or in temporary accommodation, so this policy could well bar many such people from ever getting back into secure, rented accommodation.”
It emerged in August that just seven landlords involved in the pilot scheme had been issued notices, and they faced average fines of £800."

A government scheme offering homebuyers in London interest-free loans of up to £240,000 has gone live, but critics say it will open “relatively few doors” for priced-out households.
Help to buy London is an extension of an existing scheme which offers loans for buyers of new-build properties, allowing them to purchase a home with a deposit of just 5%.
While outside the capital buyers can borrow up to 20% of a property’s cost, in London that has been doubled to 40%.

The extension, which was announced in the chancellor’s autumn statement, will be available to buyers of new properties in Greater London costing up to £600,000. As under the existing scheme, borrowers will need to qualify for a normal mortgage.
They will also have to show they can afford interest payments on the government loan when the five-year interest-free period ends.
The extension follows another year of rising house prices in London, with Land Registry figures showing a 12.4% increase in 2015, which took the average cost of an existing home to £514,097.
The housing minister, Brandon Lewis, said: “Help to buy has now helped over 130,000 people across the country achieve their aspiration of buying a new or bigger home.
“The scheme is helping people turn those dreams into a reality with a fraction of a deposit they would normally require, and from today the new London scheme will help even more people follow in their footsteps.”
However, Ed Stansfield, chief property economist at Capital Economics, said the scheme was not as generous as it first looked.
A family with a £40,000 income could buy a property costing £240,000 with the scheme outside London and £327,250 in the capital, but in most London boroughs the average price of a property is much higher.
To achieve the £525,000 which would be needed for a comparable property, Stansfield said, the London household would need an income of £64,000 and a larger deposit.
“In terms of its direct impact on a buyer’s monthly outlays, Help to buy London appears to be a significantly more generous subsidy than the original equity loan scheme it supplements,” he said. “But in other important ways it is notably less generous. On balance, compared to the original scheme, we believe Help to buy London will open relatively few doors.”
Funding for the scheme comes from the £8.6bn budget set aside to extend the help-to-buy equity loan scheme from April 2016, when it was originally due to end, to March 2021.
By the end of September 2015 3,548 households had used an equity loan to buy properties in the capital, and the government has said more than 10,000 more could benefit from the new scheme.
Ten lenders, including Halifax, Lloyds and Nationwide building society, are offering mortgages under the scheme, and rates are low. At Nationwide buyers can take out a two-year loan tracking the base rate with a starting cost of 1.64%, while a five-year fixed-rate mortgage is available at 2.64%.
Although the interest starts at 1.75%, lenders are checking that repayments can be met at up to 4%, meaning that someone borrowing the maximum £240,000 would have to show they could afford to pay £800 a month on top of their mortgage and other outgoings."
Work & careers|Shortcuts|features,2016-02-01T18:43:41,guardian,Tim Dowling,"A new study suggests Americans waste 50 minutes a day a work, but you can do much better than that if you try hard enough",https://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2016/feb/01/slackers-guide-slacking-at-work,A slackers' guide to slacking at work: 'Focus on the space between your nose and the screen',en,money|careers,,"A new study suggests Americans waste 50 minutes a day a work, but you can do much better than that if you try hard enough
If you’re not reading this at work, you should be: according to a new paper, American employees spend an average of 50 minutes of their working day engaged in non-work, ie slacking off. That may not seem like a lot to you; indeed, it may not seem like enough. Fully half of this time was spent eating, which isn’t slacking, it’s consuming food you didn’t have time to ram down your throat during your too-short lunch break.
There is plenty of evidence to suggest that a certain amount of loafing is actually good for productivity, because it restores concentration and enhances creativity. One measure of an optimum work-to-slack ratio suggests that 17 minutes of break time should be taken out of every hour. A 2011 University of Melbourne study found that people who surfed the internet at work – up to a maximum of about 20% of their total office time – were more productive than people who didn’t.
But this misses the point, which is that productivity is someone else’s problem. Your problem is to earn enough money to be able to afford your life, and one sure way to make your life cheaper is to live some of it at work, where they have to have the heat on anyway. If you need to improve your overall slacking performance, try this simple five-point plan:
1. Keep track of how much work you accidentally do outside the office. This includes any good ideas that happen to come to you while showering, work emails you read out of boredom on public transport, and any leisure minutes spent worrying about getting sacked. All this time should be clawed back during office hours by shopping online.

2. There is a point in space, roughly midway between the surface of your computer screen and your nose, where all your daydreams may be indulged. Learn to focus on it.
3. Clacking away at a keyboard may make you look busy, but true productivity is the end product of a lot of time spent being visibly less occupied: thinking is work; musing is work; speculating is work; putting yourself in a good frame of mind for work is work. To an untrained observer like your immediate supervisor, this type of mental expenditure looks remarkably similar to wondering if you left your keys on the bus, so feel free mix it up a little.
4. A lot research indicates that taking afternoon naps of between 20 to 30 minutes will increase your ability to focus and complete tasks. Your boss is unlikely to agree. If you must sleep in the office, lie down under your desk with your legs hanging out. If anyone catches you you can always pretend you were plugging something back in.
5. Once you get the hang of it, slacking is addictive in a way that work never will be. If you find yourself having to ration your YouTube viewing in order to get anything at all done in a day, then you’ve got the balance about right. Leave early."
Payday loans|Credit cards|Borrowing & debt|Social exclusion|Financial Conduct Authority|Regulators|news,2016-02-01T16:30:22,guardian,Hilary Osborne,Proposed levy coincides with government withdrawal of funding for service which has prosecuted more than 300 illegal money lenders since 2004,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/feb/01/payday-lenders-credit-firms-pay-for-illegal-money-enforcement-teams,Payday lenders and credit firms to pay for 'illegal money' enforcement teams,en,money|borrowing,,"Proposed levy coincides with government withdrawal of funding for service which has prosecuted more than 300 illegal money lenders since 2004
Payday loan firms and credit card companies could be charged a fee to fund the work of teams cracking down on loan sharks, the chancellor has announced.
From April 2017 the work of the Illegal Money Lending Teams in England and Wales will be funded by a levy on companies offering consumers credit, replacing the funding they currently receive from the government.
Since their launch in 2004, teams in England and Wales have prosecuted more than 300 illegal money lenders and had £50m of debt written off for consumers. But despite their success there were fears they would have their funding cut and be forced to reduce their workforce by a third.
The Treasury said the introduction of a levy would “ensure that the perimeter of the consumer credit market continues to be enforced, and vulnerable consumers remain protected from loan sharks”. Details of which firms will pay, and how much the levy will be, are to be consulted on.
In 2015-16 the government paid £3.6m towards running the teams, and it had been reported that there were plans to cut that sum by a third. The Treasury said the government would protect the team’s funding in 2016-17.
However, city regulator the Financial Conduct Authority will be given the power to introduce a new levy on consumer credit firms from 2017-18, replacing the government payment.
The FCA took over regulation of consumer credit providers in 2014. Since then it has brought in new rules for payday lenders, forcing them to check that borrowers can afford to repay loans, banning the repeated roll-over of debts and capping the interest and fees that firms can charge.
While the crackdown has been good news for many borrowers, in October National Trading Standards, which runs the teams, warned that alongside the roll-out of the single universal credit benefits payment it could push more people towards illegal lenders. It said loan sharks were expected to take advantage of those on a low income who may struggle to obtain credit via other means, “seeking to exploit them as they get to grips with the changes to their finances”.
We are … ensuring that enforcement teams have the funding, from the industry, that they need to protect consumers George Osborne
Announcing the levy, the chancellor George Osborne said: “I am absolutely determined to protect customers from abuse and sharp practice in the consumer credit market.
“That is why I capped the total cost of a payday loan, it’s why we’re taking further action today to tackle illegal loan sharks by ensuring that enforcement teams have the funding, from the industry, that they need to protect consumers from those that would do them harm.”
In 2015, work by the Illegal Money Lending teams resulted in 108 arrests and charges against 43 people. In one case a carer who operated a loan shark business was jailed for two-and-a-half years after a court heard how a victim who took out a £2,000 loan to send to her son in the Philippines ended up paying back more than £11,000."
Pensions|Benefits|Women|Conservatives|Labour|news,2016-02-01T22:33:09,guardian,Rowena Mason|Phillip Inman,Labour MPs brand suggestion by work and pensions minister Shailesh Vara as ‘outrageous’ and ‘shocking’,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/feb/01/women-who-lose-out-in-pensions-could-claim-jobseekers-allowance,Women losing out in pension changes 'could turn to jobseeker’s allowance',en,money|pensions,,"Women who are due to lose thousands of pounds from the government’s changes to the pension age could think about claiming jobseeker’s allowance instead, a Conservative minister has suggested.
Shailesh Vara, a work and pensions minister, listed unemployment benefit as a possible source of income for the millions of women who will have to wait up to 18 months longer to receive their entitlements because the state pension age is rising from 60 to 65 by 2018.
He made the comments shortly before a packed Westminster debate triggered by a petition of more than 140,000 people.
Campaigners say the pension reforms, which the government made in 2011, are too rushed and have not given millions of women enough time to plan for their retirement.
House of Commons research for Labour has calculated that 2.6 million women born in the 1950s will be affected.
However, Vara ruled out compensation or concessions for the women, and said the changes needed to be seen in a broader context.
He told MPs: “There are a whole lot of other benefits that are available to the women who may be affected. For example, there’s jobseeker’s allowance, there’s employment and support allowance, there’s income support, carer’s allowance, personal independence payments.
“And let us not forget that also pensions will be uprated. There’s the triple lock. There’s the simplified new state pension, which is coming in from April. Pension freedom, which allows those who have a pension to be able to have some flexibility.
“Cold weather payments – there’s a permanent increase there. Winter fuel payment has been protected – over 12 million pensioners benefited from that last year. And as far as female employment is concerned, I’ve mentioned a number of benefits that we have brought in for them.

“So it is important that we look at things in a broad context rather than simply looking at people in the narrow confines that people prefer to debate in this chamber at the moment.”
Rachel Reeves, the former shadow work and pensions secretary, said the comments were “outrageous”.
“Women don’t want unemployment benefit they want the pensions they have contributed to,” she added.
Angela Rayner, a shadow work and pensions minister, said it was “shocking” that Vara suggested jobseeker’s allowance as an alternative.
“This research shows that a staggering 2.6 million women are set to be affected by the government’s reforms,” she said. “By accelerating the rise in women’s state pension age and failing to communicate the changes properly, millions of families feel they have had their plans for later life ruined.
“It is a testament to the strength of this campaign that over 140,000 people supported calls for a debate, which was so oversubscribed that scores of MPs were not able to make their voices heard.”
The Westminster Hall debate was led by Labour MP Helen Jones, who said she was of the age that will be affected by the delay to pensions, but a number of Tory MPs also raised concerns and called for transitional relief."

Make your CV ‘scannable’
Recruiters spend an average of just nine seconds looking at your CV – so your CV needs to signpost the most important aspects of your skills and experience. “Write your CV so that the reviewer can easily scan the information you provide against the role specification they’re matching it to,” says Jon Gregory, a job search, application and interview specialist. “Your opening profile or summary at the start of your CV should do three things very directly: say what you are in terms of profession and job; say what you’re looking for; and show why you match what they want.”
Keep your applications short
It’s also important to keep your job applications short and concise. “Two pages is the maximum, as long as it is succinct and informative. Much will depend on how you choose to draw out and present your experience and skills,” says Marina Lennon, careers adviser for the Open University.
But don’t feel pressure to squash your CV onto one page if it looks messy. “A visually-appealing two-page CV will be easier on the eye than a mega-condensed one-page version. Your CV has a matter of seconds to impress, so there just isn’t time for eye strain,” says Lis McGuire, CV writer and founder of Giraffe CVs.
Dasha Amrom, founder of Career Coaching Ventures, agrees that a clear layout is essential. “I recommend a clean and simple design. It is also worth clearly outlining any key responsibilities.”
Declutter your application
Including everything you’ve ever worked on may result in a messy, cluttered CV. “Pick and choose the elements of your career that will grab the attention of your target employer and base your CV around those. You can simply detail the last few years of work experience, if that’s most relevant, or you can select and highlight older roles if they are a better representation of your skills. Don’t feel bound to list everything in reverse chronological order. If part of your experience is worth singing about, bring it to the top in a relevant experience section,” says McGuire. “In terms of what to leave out, I’d say leave out any red herrings that distract the reader from the message you are trying to get across. Every element of your CV should be included on purpose.”
Victoria McLean, CV writer and founder of CityCV.co.uk, agrees that sometimes less is more. “A CV doesn’t need to be an exact replication of everything you have ever done. So be confident in deleting parts of your career. Try and be as objective as you can.”
Order your sections depending on the job you’re applying to
“Adapt the order of the sections to reflect the type of roles you’re applying for,” says Lydia Fairman, founder of HR and recruitment consultancy Fairman Consulting. So, for example, if qualifications seem more important, have that section before job history, if the role is skills-based, have a skills section at the top. “A CV that’s too wordy won’t generally get read or work in your benefit, so use clear wording, bullet points and logical sections to make it easy to read. Don’t overcomplicate it.”
Plug gaps in your CV
To stop recruiters commenting on CV gaps, it can be helpful to mention what you did during employment breaks. “Try and account for the period in a positive way. You presumably learnt something from the period, and it will have been contributory to how you approached the later, more successful, period of your working life, so use it that way,” says Gregory.
It’s also worth thinking about whether to include uncompleted qualifications. “Deciding whether or not to include an uncompleted degree in a CV is always a tough decision and one that needs to be considered carefully,” says Lisa LaRue, career coach at CareerWorx. “If you didn’t complete the course you can include it in your CV so long as you make it very clear that you didn’t complete, by adding ‘completed two years of the three-year course’ for example.”
Of course, if you include uncompleted qualifications, “you need to be able to speak confidently and positively about why – if you can’t then I would consider leaving it out altogether,” she adds.
New year, new start: CV and cover letter advice for 2016 – live chat Read more
Make sure you show your value in your cover letter
Cover letters work by giving colour and personality to your CV. “When writing a cover letter you need to think: what is it about them that inspired you to get in touch? What common ground do you have, in terms of experience, passions, and values?” says Natasha Stanley, head of content at Careershifters. “It’s also important to be specific. Respect the time of people reading your application – and give them a clear call to action: to let you know if there are any vacancies, to have a quick 15-minute chat, or to keep your CV on file for the future,” says Natasha Stanley, head of content at Careershifters.
When changing career, show enthusiasm
When writing a cover letter for a career change, make sure you emphasise your genuine passion and interest for the new career. “You can also talk about how your previous career has helped you develop a range of transferable skills. Overall, remain positive and enthusiastic throughout. It can also help to speak with someone rather than just sending off an email. So often we shy away from picking up the phone and opting instead for an easily ignored email,” says LaRue.
Stanley agrees that speaking on the phone or face to face is the best option for career changers. “In a career change situation, look for people not for jobs. You’ll inevitably be underqualified and at a disadvantage as a career changer, so your best technique is to make meaningful connections with people who work in the industry.”
Similarly, Andrew Fennell, director of StandOut CV, adds: “Picking up some voluntary work would be a good move as you could include the work on your CV and build relationships internally.”
Keep your cover letter to one page
There is no set format when it comes to writing a covering letter. “However we would suggest that you try to keep you covering letter to one page, aim for no more than three or four paragraphs, and keep sentences short and to the point,” says Sophie Graham, careers adviser for the National Careers Service.

But as the city rapidly transforms, the hamburger stands are being erased from the urban landscape",https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/26/disappearing-hamburger-stands-downtown-los-angeles-california,The disappearing roadside hamburger stands of downtown Los Angeles,en,world|cities,,"Los Angeles’ fast-food stands are an iconic part of California’s tradition of car-oriented architecture. But as the city rapidly transforms, the hamburger stands are being erased from the urban landscape
On 8th street in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, a single stair leads to a raised, red and white tile platform. This trash-strewn urban ruin is tucked into the corner of a large parking lot within sight of the neon marquees of the Broadway theatre district. It is what remains of Taco House, one of LA’s iconic hamburger stands, which are quickly being erased from this rapidly transforming city.
Los Angeles is, of course, inextricably associated with the automobile, and it was here that many suburban building types – from modernist homes to fast-food restaurants – were pioneered. But it is changing: five transit lines are being built, and cranes loom over the city’s boulevards. The epicentre of this transition is the once moribund downtown, where a denser and wealthier city is displacing, among other things, one of its old, car-oriented icons.
The hamburger stand is part of southern California’s rich tradition of roadside architecture. These buildings are typically 100 square-foot boxes, with an outdoor window to order and pick up food. Next to the structures are rudimentary dining areas, often consisting of no more than a plastic tarp and a few fold-up chairs and tables. To compensate for their diminutive size, the stands sometimes have large signs and, in more elaborate cases, are decorated to resemble everything from a log cabin to a traditional Korean house.
Perhaps the sprawling, car-obsessed Los Angeles of the post-war era was simply an aberration
LA’s hamburger stands have held the fascination of visiting critics since the 1970s. Architects Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi famously coined the terms “ducks” and “decorated sheds” to describe buildings such as these, that use signage or elaborate decoration to signify their purpose. Reyner Banham, in his seminal book Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies, wrote rapturously about hamburgers as being “a work of visual art” and a “fantasia on functional themes”, comparable to the buildings in which they are sold.

The rise of the hamburger stand coincided with the decline of downtown Los Angeles. In the early part of the 20th century, it was the dominant centre of southern California, accounting for 90% of all retail sales. The hulking beaux arts buildings that line streets such as Spring and Broadway are a testament to downtown’s former commercial might.
However, as early as the 1920s, the car began to decentralise the city, and the need for parking subsumed downtown. Hundreds of buildings were levelled to accommodate parking lots, such as the Armory Building, which once occupied the site of Taco House. This imposing, Romanesque revival edifice, which for a time housed the city’s main post office, was levelled in 1938 and replaced by 800 sq ft of asphalt and a tiny stand.
There are approximately 20 hamburger stands left in downtown Los Angeles. They began to appear in the early 1930s, rapidly proliferated throughout the 40s and 50s, and the last was built in 1964. Only a fraction still serve food; others have been converted or stand vacant.

As white collar industries moved out of downtown in the mid-century, they were replaced by blue collar wholesalers. Responding to the new demographic brought in by these industries, kebabs, bibimbab and tortas joined hamburgers on the menus of many stands.
Ye Old Taco House has occupied the corner of a large parking lot at 4th and Hill Street since 1962. Like many of the stands, it is an immigrant-owned enterprise run by Maria Morales and her son Josh. On a slow Tuesday night, Maria helps in the kitchen as an older relative sits in the corner, watching TV. The Morales have operated the restaurant for 11 years, while the neighbourhood has transformed around them.
“Before it was only Hispanic people, now it’s everything: American people, Chinese people,” Maria explains. As we speak, two security guards walk in, ordering in Spanish, followed by a tattooed rocker, most likely in the area for one of the new trendy bars that have opened up nearby.
Downtown is the centre of one of the most diverse cities on the planet, and the eclectic menus of many of the stands cater to an array of palates. The menu at Kiku Teriyaki includes all the standard teriyaki dishes as well as a large assortment of Korean ones, ranging from spicy squid and kimchi stew to mackerel pike with kimchi. “All the restaurants on this street are owned by Koreans but I am the only one serving Korean food. They all eat here,” says its owner, Mr Lee. “Non-Koreans usually order teriyaki, but Mexicans and Armenians order Korean dishes because they like spicy food.”
Further south, Maya Heidary is preparing her stand for its grand opening. Built in 1931, Maya’s (as it is now known) is the oldest hamburger stand in downtown LA, and its log cabin facade and frying pan clock have changed little over the decades. Heidary is the fourth owner in the last year, and is having difficulty figuring out how to position her new restaurant in the changing neighbourhood.
“There are all kinds of customers here: high class, middle class,” she says. “It makes it very hard to plan my menu, because if the price is too low you won’t get the high class people, and if it’s too high you won’t get the middle class people. That is why many of the stands around here serve all kinds of food.” Her stand has traditionally served Mexican food, and she plans to keep burritos and tacos on the menu while gradually expanding into hamburgers, pizzas and wraps.
With downtown LA now boasting a residential population that has grown to over 50,000, many stands have benefited. “It’s busy all the time now: lunchtime, in the evenings,” says Maria Morales.
But these affluent new residents are not the traditional patrons of hamburger stands, and many have had to adapt. The Husky Boy stand on Broadway and 8th served office workers for decades with an “only in LA” menu of burritos, tacos and pastrami (a legacy of the Jewish and Mexican residents of Boyle Heights, east of downtown). In 2012, its mishmash façade was cleaned up and painted over with a colourful mural when it was taken over by Two Boots Pizza, a New York franchise with unorthodox pizzas with ingredients like creole chicken and jalapeño pesto.

Phil Hartman, the owner of Two Boots, was urged to come downtown by some adjacent businesses and was astonished by the buildings in the area. The diminutive stand is sandwiched between the Platt Building, a gothic revival office tower, and the elaborately ornamented Wurlitzer Building.
“I didn’t even know Los Angeles had a centre, I think a lot of people think that,” admits Hartman, a New Yorker.
With its googie architectural detailing, vivid signage and outdoor seating area, Two Boots is one of the better preserved stands in downtown. A self-described preservationist at heart, Hartman says the structure was in such poor condition that it had to be “rebuilt from scratch”. An “early adopter” of downtown, Two Boots has since been joined on the surrounding blocks by the uber-trendy Ace Hotel as well as high fashion outlets from Sweden and France.
But this rising affluence threatens the stands’ much-loved status as bastions of unpretentious, affordable food. Kim can point to each business on his block and list their rents: $7,000, $6,500, $3,000 a month. At these levels, it is nearly impossible for many of the stands to stay in business in their current form. While an entire burrito goes for $5 at many stands, at Two Boots a single slice of pizza costs $4.09.
The gentrification of Skid Row - a story that will decide the future of Los Angeles Read more
The hipsterfication of LA’s hamburger stands may, however, prove the final chapter in the saga of these half-century-old structures. A construction boom is transforming the landscape, with parking lots becoming new buildings on what seems like monthly basis. The Anzutei ramen stand on Spring Street will soon be replaced by a 28-storey luxury hotel. A 33-storey high-rise is planned for the site of Ye Olde Taco House, and those red and white tile remnants on 8th will soon be cleared to make way for a 24-storey residential tower.
Los Angeles’s transition to being denser and less car dependent is unquestionably a good thing, resulting in a more liveable and sustainable city. However, the loss of these tiny stands stokes a broader anxiety about the changes brought about by this process. These idiosyncratic, populist buildings represent the entrepreneurial, immigrant city that Los Angeles has become since the rise of the automobile. Their destruction in favour of luxury behemoths is a symbol of the city gaining wealth while losing some of its character.
Despite this tension, the re-urbanisation of Los Angeles’ core is, in a sense, the city going back to the future. If we look at photographs of downtown in the 1920s, it looks like New York or London: dense and bustling with streets packed with pedestrians, cars and trams.
So perhaps the sprawling, car-obsessed Los Angeles of the post-war era was simply an aberration. In the future, this period of car worship, which so defines the city in the popular imagination, might be seen as a stepping stone to a more urban and urbane place – albeit one with less pastrami cheeseburgers.

Women in Leadership|Debate|Work & careers|Women,2016-02-01T07:17:21,guardian,Tessa Cooper,"Companies including Penguin and Ernst & Young have announced that a degree is no longer a requirement for job applicants. It’s about time, says Tessa Cooper",https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2016/feb/01/i-chose-not-to-go-to-university-it-was-the-best-career-decision-i-ever-made,I chose not to go to university - it was the best career decision I ever made,en,lifestyle|women,,"I left school in 2009, the year before university fees rose dramatically. In my final year at school, people seemed to think that choosing a university course was the biggest decision anyone would make in their lives, and when I told my tutor that I wasn’t going to university, she stopped talking to me. Not only was I no longer of interest as I didn’t contribute to the school’s targets, but she was probably also struggling to work out how to advise me on what my next step should be.
When I started my job hunt, every single entry-level job I looked at said that a degree was mandatory. I felt incapable, like I had made a huge mistake. How would I ever get a job if they wouldn’t even give me a chance to send them my CV? My mum encouraged me to ignore the minimum requirements and apply anyway, and although I’m fairly certain the majority of places simply chucked my CV in the bin, I began to learn how to adapt my cover letter to get myself noticed. I started to research companies I wanted to work for, finding email addresses of people I’d like to work with and contacting them directly.
The process of being ignored and discriminated against ultimately made me more determined, something I believe is responsible for my career success. For many people however, I’m sure it has the opposite effect, which is why I’m entirely supportive of companies such as Penguin and Ernst & Young scrapping a degree as a job requirement.
Getting through the door was just the first hurdle. Even after I found my first job, it felt like I was asked about what university I went to or what degree I’d studied on a daily basis. The most common reaction when I said I didn’t have a degree was outright bemusement. In some cases people seemed to view me as less intelligent, and a male director once told me that I’d never be able to get far in my career, because without a degree people wouldn’t take me seriously.

But, thankfully, I also had numerous supportive mentors along the way. Early on in my career I learned how to approach people I looked up to – asking them for coffee or lunch to hear about their path to success and see if they had any advice for me. Building these relationships was the most important thing I did in my early career. The network of people I built around me showed me the potential options open to me; they spotted skills I didn’t realise I had and encouraged me to put myself out there and take risks.
People started to trust me and at every given opportunity I’d jump at the chance of taking on more responsibility. By the age of 21, I was managing a team and dealing with more than 50 clients. The volume of people I had to communicate with on a daily basis improved my ability to put my point across eloquently – another skill that has been invaluable to my career. My manager at the time encouraged me to read as much as possible; he had a rule of rotating his reading between non-fiction and fiction, and I still follow this rule today. Reading extensively helped build up my vocabulary, my general knowledge and understanding of the world, and my creativity.
I’m now more thanr six years into my career and I’ve worked at the Guardian, Comic Relief and now FutureLearn, a company whose mission is “to pioneer the best social learning experiences for everyone, anywhere”. I’ve also started a series of blog posts and events to help other young people beginning their career, and a few months ago I decided to study towards a master’s degree.
I’m not studying because I feel I need it for my career; I’m studying because I feel like I’m finally at a point where I can and I want to. For me, the key to a happy career is making decisions for yourself and choosing to do things the way you want to – even when it doesn’t seem like the obvious choice."

Black workers face a “massive pay gap” that widens as they achieve more qualifications, according to a report by the Trades Union Congress.
The research suggested there was a 23% gap in hourly pay between black and white university graduates. Black people with A-levels were paid 14% less on average than white workers with equivalent qualifications, while those with GCSEs faced a deficit of 11%.
It comes after David Cameron criticised universities over racial inequality and vowed to introduce new laws to “shame” them into action.

The TUC analysed figures from the Office for National Statistics Labour Force Survey and found black workers with a degree were paid £4.30 an hour less on average than white graduates.
Staff from all ethnic minority backgrounds faced a 10% pay deficit at degree level, rising to 17% for those with A-levels alone.
The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, told the Independent: “These are very worrying findings. Black and Asian people face a massive pay gap, even if they have a degree. This is not about education, but about the systemic disadvantages ethnic minority workers face in the UK.”
The union called for the government to tackle pay discrimination.
The figures follow a study by the Resolution Foundation last month that found ethnic minority people have lower employment rates than other groups.
The thinktank said the employment gap between the best and worst performing regions of the UK was 11%, but for black, Asian and minority-ethnic (BAME) people the figure was 26%.
Revealed: how ethnic minority graduates lose out on jobs Read more
The research follows a study reported in the Observer that found ethnic minority graduates in Britain were much less likely to be employed than their white peers six months after graduation – and many earned less for years afterwards.
The study, by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex, found British ethnic minority graduates were between 5% and 15% less likely to be employed than their white British peers six months after graduation. There are also marked disparities in wages between many ethnic minority women and black Caribbean men who find jobs after graduation and their white counterparts.
At the weekend, the prime minister warned educational institutions, the police, the military and the courts they were the focus of a new effort to tackle social inequality fuelled by “ingrained, institutional and insidious” racism."
Farming|The secret life|The meat industry|Work & careers|comment,2016-02-01T08:00:22,guardian,,"The secret life of a pig farmer: I don’t earn enough, given the hours I work and the injuries I get. But at least David Cameron hasn’t bothered my animals yet",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/powerwashing-pig-muck-breaking-point-secret-life-pig-farmer,"After a piggy morning, few things are more satisfying than a bacon sandwich",en,opinion,,"Having worked in administration for over 10 years, the decision to pursue a career in farming may perhaps not have seemed the obvious choice for a 28-year-old woman, but four years ago that is exactly what I did. Following a serious health scare, the opportunity to get involved with the family business was something that I didn’t want to pass up. I left a job that I loved and my life in the city and moved 100 miles away to run a 300-acre mixed arable and livestock farm in a rural area.
Cheap imports force UK pig farmers out of business Read more
I had grown up on the farm, surrounded by animals, and helped out for as long as I could remember. I was eight years old the first time I milked our dairy cows completely alone, while my mother was ill in bed. However, 20 years later the business had changed, and instead we kept a herd of beef suckler cows. I became responsible for their day-to-day care, providing assistance as required during calving season, administering medication and harvesting grass to provide silage for winter feed.
With supermarkets importing so much cheap meat from Europe, the British beef prices regularly fluctuate and it can be hard to run a viable business on a small scale. Though I was trying to expand my herd of 20 cows to a herd of 100, it proved to be challenging, expensive and labour-intensive.
When the suggestion was made that we change the focus of the business from cattle to pigs, I was hopeful that we would be able to improve the farm’s income. The pigs are owned and sold by another farmer who provides the feed and medication. For my part, I provide the housing, bedding and day-to-day care and welfare management. Perhaps I was naive to think it would be easier.
The feeders are automated, the buildings have been specially designed to take into consideration the specific needs of the animals; many hours were spent researching and planning exactly how to provide the best possible care for the pigs. The system operates on a three-month cycle; the pigs arrive at around 40kg and leave when they reach bacon weight – around 110kg. Then begins a period of intensive cleaning that usually lasts about a week. During this time I have to muck out, steam clean and disinfect all areas of the farm in which pigs have been kept. The days become long – typically around 16 hours spent standing, soaked to the skin and staring at walls as I powerwash pig muck off them.
I take a lot from my job on the good days. I enjoy feeling physically exhausted; being outdoors and watching the seasons change; keeping the mortality rates below average. Those are the days I feel that I’m succeeding. Conversely, mental exhaustion, extreme weather and disease outbreaks completely drain me. I struggle to find motivation, become despondent and have to fight just to keep going. The cleaning period alone has twice pushed me to breaking point, needing antidepressants and counselling just to keep me going. Differentiating between home and work is impossible for me. Unless I’m off the farm, I’m essentially at work. From my house I can hear the pigs squealing; the alarms on the sheds sounding; the feeders running. On Christmas Day we couldn’t sit down to lunch as the pig feeder failed to run and I had to feed the animals first. The noise and the smell, though intrusive and offensive at first, fade into the background and become unnoticeable after a while.
After cleaning a 91-year-old's bondage gear, I couldn't look at him the same way again Read more
The pigs themselves are both frustrating and comical. With 1,500 on site at the current maximum capacity, you’d think it would be difficult to tell one animal from the next, but that’s not always the case. When pigs become sick, I put them into an intensive care shed and it is here that I find myself getting to know their personalities and their quirks. En masse, pigs can be brutal. There’s a definite mob mentality and every day I get bitten and crushed. But one to one, they are intelligent and affectionate. Foolishly, I can’t help but name and develop bonds with them, but the end is inevitable - they’re not my pigs after all, and I do find it hard to say goodbye. There have been times I’ve watched the wagon leave with tears in my eyes, having said farewell to a pig I’ve come to consider as more of a pet than a pay cheque, but it’s a hard fact of life that sentimentality doesn’t pay the bills.
After managing the first six months alone, my parents finally employed a member of staff to help me. Just to have someone else there to talk to and share the daily struggles with was a relief. By the fourth cycle, I made the decision to step back from the business for a few months. We employed another member of staff and I took a part-time job as a shop assistant in our nearest town just to get me away from the farm. It was during this period that I managed to negotiate better working terms; a five-day week being the most significant change.
I very rarely feel that I’m compensated fairly with my pay; for the injuries I sustain; for the damage that the dusty atmosphere is doing to my already asthmatic lungs; and for the 4am starts on the days we have to send pigs to slaughter, but I know that with three staff on the books, a business this small struggles to pay more. However, as a friend of mine recently pointed out, irrespective of how tough I occasionally find my job, at least I’ve yet to go outside and find David Cameron brushing one of my pigs’ teeth, so it’s all relative.
The job is not without its perks, of course. There are few things more satisfying after a morning of particularly difficult piggy business than eating a bacon sandwich. And, of course, the bacon is British.

Choice, choice everywhere. How do I opt out? | Phil Daoust Read more
A few years back I was considering taking six months out to travel. As with most changes of direction, there was a risk to it. Some of the time I felt, in my gut, that it was the right step. But the feeling didn’t last long enough for me to lean on it. The potential, irreversible drawbacks were never far behind. I needed to be persuaded or to persuade myself either way.
I emailed a close friend, presenting my plan to her. She was immediately enthusiastic, and replied setting out the numerous possibilities of the “open road”: I wasn’t supporting a family, and if not now then when was I going to have another chance like this and get as much from it. The world awaited, she assured me; and the answer was to do it. Something about her boundless support for it unleashed my internal arguments against the plan. I needed to hear another view.
The combined input enables cherry-picking and a degree of abdication of responsibility
I bashed out a message to a colleague whose response stressed the loss of job security, structure, and the danger that I thought stepping out to be a cure-all; she brought the “then what?” angle. It wasn’t that I hadn’t arrived at these considerations myself, but having them spelled out gave me a ready-made argument to present back to the “open road” advocate. More views from others followed. One advising, if in doubt wait; another, that without stepping off the edge nothing happens. I wasn’t proud of it, but I’d made my future a debate, which suggested there was at least no wrong answer.
The next decision was different but to me just as important. I outsourced the question of moving from my much-loved but entirely impractical flat to another I’d seen, which would improve my day-to-day life on a number of levels. Here, photos could be part of the exchanges in which I argued for and against myself. I knew who loved where I lived and who would feel it a mistake.
The third debate was with fewer friends. It was my way to decide whether to meet up with a much-missed ex who had reappeared in my life a decade after we had gone our separate ways. I’d thought often of what might have been, but our circumstances had changed, and there were many reasons not to meet him, now that those scenarios were no longer possible. I think I needed some emotional robustness on screen, whatever I chose.
I didn’t take the six months; I met the ex; and I kept my flat. Perhaps something in the discussion, on each occasion, allowed me to know what I would do.
How to stop 24/7 email ruining your life Read more
To seek the input of others is not new. But in another era it might have involved a phone call or the slower exchange of letters. Now the ready speed of email seems to have changed the mechanism. We can elicit multiple viewpoints at once, stacking them up for reference. And we can provide and reintroduce them. With humour and with patience my friends are pretty much all on the other side of my screen. There for the asking, as I am for them. And I revisit their words, often.
All this, of course, can extend to consulting strangers. One has only to think of forums such as Mumsnet to see how our internal dialogues can be reflected in external debate.
Does it help or hinder? Undoubtedly, there’s a point beyond which you know you’ve gathered too much information. The combined input, though, enables cherry-picking and a degree of abdication of responsibility, which can take some of the stress out of things. Perhaps some of its value can be unforeseen, like the idea for this piece, which came from a friend involved in one such discussion. And I may just be a very bad decision-maker, but I have not felt alone."

I think I’m in the middle of such a lurch. Yesterday, I could only see half of my computer screen, or half of anything. The other halves were blank, or filled with zig-zaggy lights. I had to lie down in a darkened room. I lie down rather a lot anyway nowadays, but yesterday I had planned to stay upright and work. No chance. Foolishly, I tried to have a little read when the zig-zags faded, but the words got themselves into the wrong order, so I gave up and had a cry, because was it just a headache, or something worse?
I always tend to think “something worse” if I get a chance, usually war, sepsis, dementia or a sudden fall from my perch, which seems quite probable, since a number of famous people of around my age have recently died, with Terry Wogan going yesterday. Very sad. And some of my friends are also lurching: Toad’s ticker is playing up, Rosemary’s heart, lungs and liver are rather dicey, Fielding is having terrible trouble with his gnashers, and my old dog is on steroids.
Last night, I dreamt I had Trump-hair. My hair had become a stiff, lacquered, see-through toupee, and my skull completely bald underneath. Horrors. I’ve tried to ignore Trump, but American Cousin, who lives here, has been panicking about him and her homeland, so he’s wormed his way into my dreams – hair-loss fitting in nicely with the lurch downwards into general decrepitude.
I tried to turn on the radio to distract myself, but could barely hear it – another sensibility going down the pan – and couldn’t get my stinky new hearing aid to work. But as I don’t want to depress you all, I’d like you to know that these lurches usually stop, tend to plateau out, and are forgotten, temporarily.

And the sooner we accept this as the natural order of things the better, frankly. Six months after taking his GCSEs, the 16-year-old just shot an advertising campaign for Burberry fragrance.
'Sheer nepotism': Brooklyn Beckham Burberry shoot angers photographers Read more
The news has been greeted with inevitable outrage by some established fashion photographers. When you’ve worked at a career for decades and then a kid with a cute man-bun who last year still hadn’t decided whether to be a footballer or a photographer leapfrogs you on the career ladder, taking photos on his skateboard, that’s going to wind you up. I get that. But to accuse Burberry of not picking the best man for the job entirely misses the point. The purpose of an advertising campaign for Burberry Brit is not to promote photography as an art form, it is to promote and sell a fragrance aimed at young people. Brooklyn Beckham behind the camera has put this campaign in broadsheet newspapers and on celebrity gossip pages before Burberry have bought a single ad site. And I suspect a 16-year-old landing a dream job by taking really good selfies will prove to be a pretty compelling story for the teenagers this product is aimed at.
Who knows: secretly, the Queen might be a bit fed up that she’s had weekly audiences with 12 prime ministers and made 16 state visits to Australia, and yet Princess Charlotte, who can’t walk or talk, came in four places above her at number one on Tatler’s list of People Who Really Matter. But she’s just going to have to keep a stiff upper lip about it, because it’s the kids who count, these days. Before Brooklyn’s Burberry news, the last fashion advertising campaign to make the news was Louis Vuitton’s womenswear, which stars Jaden Smith, son of Will and Jada. Lily-Rose Depp, daughter of Johnny and Vanessa, just landed her first glossy cover of the new issue of Love magazine. At this rate, the current state of affairs, in which women campaign for more visibility in public life after 40 or 50, may soon seem in hindsight to have been a golden age for oldies. The way things are going, 20 will soon be the age at which you become invisible.
But the hostility to the offspring of the famous is less about youth than about celebrity. The modern obsession with celebrity has created a new global aristocracy. But having manufactured these people for our own amusement, we accidentally breathed life into a whole Debrett’s of new dynasties. The Kardashian-Wests, the Beckhams, the Osbournes, the Jolie-Pitts. Stardust has crystallised into real power, with famous parents able to hand front-row seats at fashion week and lucrative modelling contracts down to the next generation much in the way that the aristocracy of old would hand down titles and oil paintings. All we wanted were pretty people to look at in movies and in Vogue, and we went and created the modern equivalent of a hereditary peerage, by mistake. There is a lot of snobbery here. Note how much more the unstoppable rise of celebrity offspring gets our goat when they come from what aren’t, in the cultural sense, posh families. If your surname is Coppola, or Gainsbourg, the world will look less cynically on your pursuit of an artistic career than if your surname is Beckham.
And anyway, the only people who really truly understand how the world works, these days, are kids. Brooklyn Beckham landing the Burberry gig is just the next logical step in a process that began when they started making TV remote controls so complicated that only people under 12 could figure out how to use them. Proficiency with a light meter is not necessarily a more important skill than the ability to create an image and a caption that works on social media. Thirty years of experience, or millions of Instagram followers? No contest."

Two experts give their advice and test out John Lewis’s selection to find the best bed for a silent night
We will spend almost a third of our lives sleeping, so it makes sense to spend time, thought and money on which mattress we buy. The right one, say Deane Halfpenny – a consultant in musculoskeletal pain medicine – and osteopath Rehana Kapadia, can ensure you are not only more comfortable, but healthier, too.
Kapadia recommends investing time trying them out. “Some people just go into the shop and press them to see how they feel, ” she says, “but I would say you should lie down for 20 minutes on each one. If you just hop on and off, it’s hard to imagine how you will feel after an eight-hour sleep.”

Halfpenny agrees and says spending as much as you can afford on a bed is a good long-term investment in your health – especially when they typically last between seven and 10 years. “In sleep studies where you observe patients through the night, you see how much we all move when we sleep. But if you are uncomfortable, you move constantly and your sleep is not as restful as it should be.

“Undisturbed sleep is important because of the fluctuating hormones that are released when we sleep. Disturbed sleep disrupts these patterns. Our bodies are constantly breaking down and rebuilding, and restorative sleep allows your muscles to relax and improves blood flow – [especially] to the discs in your back, which normally have poor blood flow. If your muscles are tense, you won’t get that restorative blood flow.”
Kapadia advises choosing a mattress that is supportive as well as comfortable. Halfpenny agrees. “Patients often think they should be getting a firm, orthopedic mattress. But, actually, if your mattress is too firm, you can end up with hyperlordosis, where the arch in your back is exaggerated.”
Instead, you should think about a mattress that is soft enough to allow you to sink into it, while firm enough to support you. “It’s about surface area and pressure,” says Halfpenny. “The more of your body that is in contact with the mattress, the less pressure on your shoulders or hips.”

Halfpenny says that, if you choose the right mattress, whichever position you sleep in will be comfortable and healthy. But Kapadia disagrees. She says the optimum position for sleep – to avoid back problems or ligament strain – is on your side with your knees bent. This is because it allows your body – from the back of your head, through your neck, spine and pelvis – to align. “Even without pillows, your neck, spine and pelvis should be in line, so that you aren’t twisted, or turned in on yourself,” she says.
Dream decor: ideas to update your bedroom Read more
“If you sleep on your front – it doesn’t matter how good the mattress – you will twist your neck and back; your head will be turned to the side and your leg probably twisted up. Even sleeping on your back with your legs straight can put strain on your lower back.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Kapadia suggests taking a friend bed-shopping with you to check your alignment as you lie on a bed. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi for the Guardian
She says that, although many people think they have little control over the positions they adopt in their sleep, it is possible to train yourself to sleep on your side – and doing so is a good idea to avoid long-term back problems.
However, because our shoulders and hips are our broadest points, even lying on your side on a too-firm surface can throw this alignment out, says Kapadia. “You can get a lumbar spine sag, meaning your middle will drop into a U shape, stressing the spine ligaments, which can press on your nerves.”
So, for eight hours, your ligaments will be working instead of resting. As a result, you can wake up feeling achy instead of rested. “This is why you need a bed that will allow your shoulders and hips to sink in, then your waist and side are supported.”
In fact, Kapadia suggests taking a friend bed-shopping with you to check your alignment as you lie on a bed – or even taking a photograph to show how well you are supported. The worst mattresses, Halfpenny warns, are the old, soft ones, which dip like hammocks in the middle, curving your back.
Another tricky issue is buying a mattress for a couple, as each person may have different needs, thanks to their different shapes and weights. “You don’t want one of you to sink in and the other to be bouncing on the top. It’s about surface area and pressure. You need to sink in at first, and then be supported.”

Halfpenny says choosing a bed with breathable, natural materials can improve your sleep quality – so that you don’t get too hot and sweaty in the night. But, for those with allergies, Kapadia suggests trying out a bed with natural latex instead. It’s also worth thinking about a bed with a slatted base so that air can circulate, or one with pocket springs to match the mattress. For older patients, and those who find it hard to get in and out of bed, getting a higher base can also help. If you are on a very tight budget and can’t afford the mattress you want, buying a decent one and adding a mattress topper for extra comfort can help.
Finally, don’t forget to think about pillows, say the experts at John Lewis. If you sleep on your side, you might need a firmer one, to fill the space between the side of your head and shoulder. If you are on your back, you need a softer one to keep your neck in line with your spine. Anyone sleeping on their front needs a very flat pillow.
But Halfpenny has a final warning: even when you successfully find the perfect bed, your problems might not be over. The pain specialist says he spent more than £4,000 finding the right mattress for himself and his wife, and hours researching it. Although now he can happily sleep for 10 hours at a time, there is one drawback – going on holiday or to visit family is torture. “I just want to get back to my mattress!”

Rehana: This is really high end. It is lovely! My body is nicely supported so my lower spine is not being pushed down or up. This is expensive. It can be short-sighted to buy too cheap a mattress – try to buy the best you can afford.
Deane: This is fantastic. Perfect. Not too hard or soft.
£1,725 in a kingsize
R: Memory foam like this moulds to your body, but some people find they can get very hot. It’s not very breathable and it retains a lot of heat. If you can’t afford one, you could buy a mattress topper for support.
D: This mattress takes time to mould around you, but it’s very supportive. It is firm, but not overly so.

R: This is hypoallergenic and has the firmness of a memory foam, but with a bit more bounce. I thought I would like latex but I prefer the other ones.
D:I can’t get comfortable – it is far too firm for me. My spine might be in a good position but I don’t feel like I can sink in.

Crime drama|Last night's TV|Drama|Television|reviews,2016-02-01T07:15:21,guardian,Chitra Ramaswamy,"Not many actors can pull off shambolic and effective, but Blethyn can do it with a single, penetrating glance from beneath that hat",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/01/vera-brenda-blethyn-review-solvable-murder,Vera review: Brenda Blethyn stomps on the moor with a solvable murder,en,culture|tv & radio,,"There are now roughly as many types of crime series as there are crimes. The ones that make you scratch your head, or covet knitwear, or sign Change.org petitions or feel a bit stupid (yes, Sherlock, I’m talking about you). Then there are the ones that make you feel cosy, mildly creeped out, and in sudden need of a holiday cottage on the windswept northern coast, all at the same time. You know, the really British ones. These series induce a weird yet not entirely unpleasant brew of emotions, which is precisely the analgesic many of us are after as we lie slumped and silly on our sofas on Sunday night.
Vera (ITV) slots into this latter category as neatly as a dry stone in a Northumbrian wall. It took me about five seconds to glaze over. In a good way. There she was, Brenda Blethyn’s DCI Vera Stanhope, stomping across the moor. (She was clearing her head, something she does a lot by walking across the moor, which is convenient because it looks so ruddy lovely.) A defiant and lonely figure, hatted and mac-ed. The moor all rugged and dusky. Nothing but a new day and a solvable murder on the horizon. What’s not to like? By the time the camera panned over an old stone cottage and the deserted sands it overlooked, I was gone.
Closely followed by Northumberland, Blethyn is the best thing about Vera – now on its sixth series and still watched by millions, most of whom are awake – by a long shot. It’s stating the obvious (something this series does a lot), but I just can’t imagine Vera without Vera. She has the loveliest voice, at once girlish and gruff. Her face is kind but means business. Not many actors can pull off shambolic and effective, but Blethyn can do it with a single, penetrating glance from beneath that hat. She is sensitive but often fails to see the grouse for the moors. Like at the start of the episode when she sees the body of a woman found lying on the moor and pronounces her in her late 30s. “More like 50s, look at her hands,” one of the team corrects her. Oh well, only 20 years out. Sometimes, when I saw her pulling up in her battered Land Rover, I forgot what I was watching and thought she was the village vet.
Anyway, it fails to matter that Vera doesn’t twig who the murderer is until it’s so obvious even I had figured it out – and I never figure it out. She’s Vera! She calls people “pet” and “love”, even when she’s about to bring them in for questioning. She knows the Latin names of plants and can say them out loud without looking like a pretentious git. She’s been trained by Mike Leigh, for God’s sake. Let’s show some respect.
The plot is of the neat and tidy box-ticking variety. And my word, it drags on. Six ad breaks come and go as Vera bumbles about the beautiful place investigating the murder of a grandmother recently returned from Edinburgh to reconcile with her two daughters. We learn a lot about a lot. About the lady’s mantle (I can’t remember its Latin name), a flowering plant more usually found on the roadside than the moors. About the fractious relationship between the victim and her daughters, the farmer with the grudge, the publican who doesn’t want to upset the locals, the secret boyfriend working for a local taxi firm, the neighbour who heard a car door slam, his carer who may or may not be posting abusive comments online … Pretty much the only person who isn’t questioned is Richards’ two-year-old granddaughter.
Just as I was really glazing over, still in a good way, things got quite exciting. The big reveal – well, for Vera anyway – prompted a car chase (across the moor, naturally) and something genuinely unexpected happened. The sort of real, dark, sad thing you don’t expect in a crime series like Vera. Suffice to say I was momentarily jolted out of my Sunday night stupor. In a good way, obviously.
Is Storyville, A Death Row Tale: The Fear of 13 (BBC4, Sunday) part of the true crime wave that includes Serial, The Jinx and most recently Netflix’s Making A Murderer? Sort of. It’s a documentary by British director David Sington about a convicted murderer, Nick Yarris, who after 23 years on death row petitioned for the right to be executed promptly, despite maintaining his innocence. Sington presents this remarkable story in the style of a one-man play. Most of the film is Yarris, on his own, talking against a black background. It’s intense. And what an extraordinary storyteller he is, whether recounting the “institutional sock threaded into the torn tissue” of his feet after a three-hour chase across the country or the joy of learning to read novels in prison. In fact it’s all so polished, charismatic and evocative of classic American crime fiction that I actually thought Yarris was being played by an actor at first. That’s the issue with this curiously addictive strain of stranger-than-fiction crime. As long as the genre relies on the devices of fiction to tell a strange story, it can end up feeling a bit unreal."

It was during a ferocious cold snap; things took an amorous turn, but there was no question of removing winter garb. My younger self responded with unexpected vim to the firm touch of my wife’s begloved hand. Since that time, and especially recently, no intimate encounter has had meaning without a mental replaying of that wintry night.
Your erotic thoughts are your own business, and it is unnecessary to share them with anyone else – even a spouse. Many people have a fairly narrow sexual script, but you have one wonderfully erotic fantasy to replay whenever you want. In my opinion, you should feel comfortable using this scenario privately whenever you wish. But, on a more practical note, as people age it is normal to need direct genital stimulation as a prelude to strong arousal, so your wife’s hand could be providing more than an acting-out of a favourite fantasy.
Perhaps you could help her to understand this, and also to be aware of the importance you place on such a fantastically inspiring memory. Express your loving gratitude to her for that. If she truly appreciates how much your love, attraction and erotic bond with her are associated with that formative moment, she may feel more disposed to participate generously. If she does, be sure to reciprocate by trying to accommodate her needs and fantasies as well.

But don’t rush to get them fixed just yet …,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/feb/01/pass-notes-selfie-teeth,Selfie loathing: are phone pics sending people to the dentist?,en,today's paper|g2,,"A combination of extreme close-ups and smartphone lenses is making people think their teeth are too big. But don’t rush to get them fixed just yet …
Name: “Selfie teeth”.
Appearance: Horsey.
Location: In your head.
Isn’t that where most teeth can be found? Yes, although in this case, I’ve made clever use of ambiguity, because “selfie teeth” are often a figment of your imagination.
I see. So you are giving me a brief, lighthearted guide to something that doesn’t exist? I am. Look, people have recently started taking a lot more close-up photographs of their own faces, or using their phones as mirrors. Agreed?
With a slow, lugubrious sigh, yes. And some phone cameras are fitted with slightly weird lenses that make things close to them look inflated at the centre of the screen.
If you say so. And as a result, a lot of people think they have huge, horse-like teeth. “Teeth often look more protruding than they are in real life, which can also be emphasised by the light of the flash,” Dr Tim Bradstock-Smith told the Times.
Who’s he? Clinical director of something called the London Smile Clinic. “As teeth are at the centre of the image, people are understandably driven to make them look nicer,” he added.
“Understandably” is often just a nice way of saying “stupidly”, isn’t it? It is indeed. Anyway, Bradstock-Smith says that over the last five years he’s seen a 30% rise in people “sending in selfies with concerns about their front teeth”.
Interesting. Has he published his data? I mean that could just be four emails instead of three. No. Still, “when they come in, often the teeth don’t look too bad.” he says. “We dissuade two to three patients each week from treatment, and for many others, will recommend simple alignment of front teeth instead of major intervention.”
Wait a minute … so “many” of these people do actually end up paying to get their teeth fixed? Yup. “The two front teeth look good being a little more dominant, with a step in length between these and the next two,” Bradstock-Smith explains. “It creates a ‘smile curve’ and it’s a natural, feminine appearance.”
I’m confused. Are selfies making people needlessly anxious about their appearance, or helping them to spot defects they’d never seen before? Who says it can’t be both?
Do say: “I promise that your teeth do not make you look ugly.”
Don’t say: “It’s more of a whole-face issue.”"
Women|Internet|Gender|Inequality|Feminism|features,2016-02-01T17:55:54,guardian,Leah Harper|Hannah Ewens,"Thousands of female writers are choosing to publish their work via subscriber-only emails, free from online abuse and ridicule. Two writers debate the merits of the ‘safe space’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/01/do-feminists-need-newsletters-subscriber-emails-online-abuse-safe-space,Do feminists need newsletters?,en,lifestyle|women,,"‘At the time of writing, I have 3,946 unread emails’
I don’t have my own newsletter. I’ve never even written a blog. But I’m not oblivious to the work that goes into producing a publication to which someone with even a half-hearted interest in women’s issues might want to subscribe. Increasingly, there are writers and thinkers willing to put in this work: this week alone, I have enjoyed Anne T Donahue’s musings on female friendship and, skipping over Dolly Alderton’s meditations on how we treat the elderly, listened to her Spotify playlist in its entirety.
The rise of email newsletters, popularised by TinyLetter (owned by MailChimp), is a significant development in contemporary feminism. Checking Twitter, it can feel like everyone and their nan wants you to sign up to a weekly, while Grazia declared 2016 “the unofficial year of the newsletter”.
In 2014, TinyLetter already had more than 100,000 users – many of them women in search of a safe space online. The nature of the service means writers (professional or otherwise) have the ability to share thoughts and ideas without the risk of ridicule, death threats or the misogynistic trolling so prevalent on the internet.
These were among the reasons Lena Dunham gave for stepping away from her Twitter feed and launching the Lenny Letter with Jenni Konner last year. Their mission was to create “a snark-free place for feminists to get information: on how to vote, eat, dress, fuck, and live better”. Sure, there should be a place for these things – however, I’m not convinced that place is my inbox.
At the time of writing, I have 3,946 unread emails. I’m signed up to the Hackney Freecycle Group, despite never having freecycled, and receive emails from notonthehighstreet.com, because I once assumed it to be less twee than Etsy (I was wrong). And now I am subscribed to a handful of feminist newsletters – too many of which will go unread, lost between Transport for London updates and Time Out offers (not to mention those Labour party emails).
Karen Boyle, professor of feminist media studies at the University of Stirling, believes the trend may be because “mainstream media outlets weren’t always sympathetic to feminism”. As she points out, the form has a feminist history: “Ad hoc publications have been a feature of women’s organising for a long time ... But [these newsletters] were produced by and for a community, and there was robust debate – not a ‘here’s what I did at the weekend’ newsletter.”
For female voices to move from mainstream platforms – where coverage of women’s issues and voices has increased – to niche, subscriber-only newsletters seems a backward step. And while some writers continue to embrace the spirit of organising a feminist community – just this week, blogger Emma Gannon used her weekly newsletter to announce plans to host “a new kind of panel event hosted by and for women off the internet” – too often, it seems, the newsletters either resemble a never-ending newspaper column, or a list of everything the writer has been reading, watching, eating, listening to ... everything they could have tweeted, essentially. Journalist Ann Friedman has been curating her own newsletter in this style since 2013, linking to articles written by herself and by others, and published on a public platform. Self-promotion rather than self-publishing, in this instance – which is no bad thing.
I remain unconvinced that this is the best use of their efforts. All-female communities can be great, but they risk overlooking the importance of including all genders within conversations on feminism. What is the value in keeping interesting, original and thought-provoking content behind closed doors? For those with a feminist agenda, tapping into the movement’s newsletter traditions might, these days, result in merely preaching to the converted. And while the abuse levelled at women – on social media and below the line – is abhorrent, letting trolls push female writers out of public spaces is tantamount to letting them win. So yes, maybe newsletters can provide a safe space for women. The question is: do we really want to play it safe? Leah Harper
‘It’s no wonder women embrace this rare space so fully’
When Lena Dunham announced she was launching her feminist newsletter last summer, I groaned. We didn’t need more – we had her work, Twitter, interviews. But having been repeatedly called out for not being intersectional in her feminism, Dunham made sure that Lenny was different. Women of colour and minority voices were included; the product is a very good one. Plenty of celebrities, brands and companies have taken up the format in the last year or two, but who cares? The beauty of a newsletter is not that it is just another way to push content. It’s about the grassroots nature of what goes on in an email.
Something about the DIY nature of newsletters feels (albeit fractionally) as exciting as the early blogging days. As a pre-teen, growing up in the first generation of digital natives, people from my small town embraced Wordpress and Blogspot to carve out a space of their own. They shared thoughts about music, culture, life, love, drugs, anything. Everyone had access to a platform and a lot of young people were using it – me and a lot of my female friends included.
If you go on Twitter now, you’ll see minorities – trans people, women of colour, gay women – with TinyLetter URLs in their bios, allowing you to subscribe to their newsletters. If you like their worldview or have similar experiences, you can learn more. The newsletter is a perfect way for the writer to elaborate on their ideas and share them in a longer format, direct to your inbox. By its very format, it’s democratic. All anyone needs to start one is a computer or smartphone and a tiny audience.
The beauty of it is in the do-it-yourself element. Your words are not for a publication. They didn’t have to be pitched and accepted; you don’t need a qualification. Your thoughts aren’t edited and played with. You just need something to share. This is an extremely rare space: far from monetary pressures, hits and targets that must be met, where pieces are churned out and every news hook capitalised on. A space where something of genuine merit could be made. We must defend and nurture this space, while online journalism consumes itself.
There are accusations that “newsletter feminism” is like shouting into a vacuum. If you think that, you’ve probably never been fiercely, personally, attacked online for just sharing your views or a piece you’ve written. Newsletters aren’t the only form of media reacting to this online battlefield. When Broadly, Vice’s woman’s interest channel, launched, it did so without comments. Other publications have since followed suit or are showing interest in doing so.
So, it’s no wonder that women – who take the brunt of online abuse – are embracing the format so fully. The internet has become a place of tension, fighting and heated debate. It’s relentless. The firepit can be brilliant and powerful for those who should be heard and for those who could do with learning. But, sometimes, you want a break from it, or you risk getting fatigued and then silenced. The one-directional nature of newsletters, then, is a blessing.
Newsletters are not about closing off discussion from opposing views. They are about letting someone speak about something potentially sensitive in safety. Safe spaces are often needed, and they aren’t going away – sorry. Women deserve to create and distribute without censorship or fear of backlash. Given the current climate online, newsletters are something we should be celebrating wholeheartedly. Hannah Ewens"

British TV’s most celebrated hotel owner once performed a goosestep across his foyer with a finger held under his nose, in approximation of Hitler’s moustache. Basil Fawlty then asked his German guests why one of them was sobbing. “Will you stop talking about the war?” snapped one. “Me?” asked Fawlty. “You started it.” “We did not start it!” “Yes, you did – you invaded Poland.”
That may have been back in the 1970s, but Britons still can’t stop mentioning the war. On Radio 4’s News Quiz recently, Hugo Rifkind noted that the mayor of Cologne had recommended that – following a spate of sexual attacks, reportedly by Arab men – women should keep strangers at arm’s length. “I’m just not sure it’s the best advice,” said Rifkind, “to tell Germans confronted with a racial minority to stand in a public place with their arms out.”

Why does so much British comedy still rely on memories of a conflict that ended 70 years ago? Because, as is always the case with humour, the joke says more about the teller than its target. Consider Harry Enfield’s early 1990s character Jürgen the German, a tourist in London struggling with his country’s historic shame. His catchphrase? “I feel I must apologise for ze conduct of my nation during ze var.” Each week, Jürgen would lose his sangfroid because of some failing in British life (trains not running on time, say).
It’s high time we stopped mentioning the war | Letters Read more
No doubt I’m reading too much into Enfield’s creation, but I suspect he was partly exploring British envy for Germans. As a nation, we have never felt moved to do what we should – namely, reflect on how utterly disgusting we were (and perhaps still are) as a nation and an empire.
‘I feel I must apologise’ … Harry Enfield as Jürgen the German
In reality, Germans are not like Jürgen and more like Gottfried the exchange student in the BBC’s Outnumbered: sane, multilingual astute observers of the folly of modern Britain. In one episode, Gottfried asked if it was really true that this buffoon with the silly hair, this man whom Germans recognise as an obvious twerp, has been elected mayor of London? The joke traded on the rather convincing idea that it’s the British who are laughable, not the Germans.
That’s why the tagline for the new Dad’s Army film is so funny: “The British Empire strikes back.” We know it never will. All we have is humour to express and explore our repression, our economic inadequacies, our infantilism and our many, many failings. We’re unbeatable at that.
“Such smart uniforms,” Sergeant Wilson was fond of observing of the Nazis in the Dad’s Army series. “Blind obedience, Wilson,” Captain Mainwaring would retort, livid at his subordinate’s lack of patriotic sentiment. Dad’s Army was an exploration of many comically rich areas, one of them being Britain’s enduring incredulity that this shambles of a nation could have defeated such a militarily – and sartorially – superior foe. Some might say its abiding popularity shows how irredeemably hidebound the British are: we’re mired in anti-German feelings for a Germany that no longer exists, and wedded to a pride in a Britain that never was.
But that would be a misunderstanding of how comedy works – and of how Germans figure in postwar British culture. It may seem that the British hate the Germans but (and feel free to read this aloud in the comedy accent of a Viennese psychoanalyst) the truth is we are actually projecting our own inadequacies on to the symbolic other. In other words, we hate ourselves more.

As Freud put it in Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious, humour allows us to release ideas and emotions that have been repressed. The euphoria it triggers returns us to “the mood of our childhood when we were ignorant of the comic, when we were incapable of jokes, and we had no need of humour to make us feel happy in our life”.
Freud never lived to see ’Allo ’Allo!, which ran from 1982 to 1992, but he would have recognised its comically pervy Nazis – Herr Otto Flick and Private Helga Geerhart, both played by Brits – as a euphoric release of repressed sexual energies in socially acceptable sitcom form. In one episode, hotsy-totsy Helga reveals that her silk knickers have been stolen to repair a hot-air balloon. “Not,” wails Herr Flick, “ze vones viz ze little swastikas around ze edge?”

This projection of sado-masochistic British sexual fantasies on to German bodies is an abiding cultural theme. It’s arguably why, for instance, Ian Dury rhymed “Hit me with your rhythm stick” with “Das ist gut/Ich liebe dich” in 1978 before adding: “Hit me, hit me, hit me!”
When are Britons going to get over these stereotypes and realise that Germany is not a land of risible Weimar temptresses and jackbooted Nazi thugs? Not for ages yet. Not because we hate Germans, but because we need them – to personify what we fear about ourselves but daren’t admit.
Germans, understandably, detest being cast in this role. Writing in Der Spiegel, Marco Evers examined this self-serving fairy story by taking a look at English football fans going to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. “No matter where they looked, they could see no goosestepping policemen in leather coats or German supermen. Instead, they encountered fantastic weather, peaceful fan zones and hedonistic partying Germans who bore no similarity to the ‘Krauts’ described in the British media.” Perhaps the only words more terrifying to British ears than “advancing Nazi stormtroopers” are “hedonistic partying Germans” enjoying “fantastic weather”.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dad’s Army - video review
I can’t believe I’ve got this far without detonating the H-bomb. Why do Britons like dressing up as Hitler? Freddie Starr is significant for adding short trousers to what is substantially Charlie Chaplin’s impersonation in The Great Dictator. Comedian Richard Herring’s 2009 appropriation of Hitler’s moustache is more interesting. Herring was obliged to defend himself from those who thought he was endorsing racism, in dressing up as Hitler to make some unpalatable remarks. Nonsense, retorted Herring: “It is an age-old comedic device to say the opposite of what you believe in order to demonstrate the ultimate stupidity of the stated position. Is it heresy to explore the arguments of the racist? Some liberals might think so.” So dressing up as Hitler offers a space for Britons to confront the intolerable, to imaginatively explore evil.

When are Britons going to stop stereotyping Germans as Nazis? Probably never. Put it this way: where would British actors be without the Nazis? Unemployed, most likely. I’m not just talking about Herr Flick and his comedy henchpersons. Right now, I’m enjoying watching Rufus Sewell as a smouldering Nazi psychopath in The Man in the High Castle, Amazon’s TV adaptation of Philip K Dick’s what-if-the-Nazis-had-won novel.

Sewell is only the most recent of a long line of Britons who have excelled as either Nazis or Nazi-like Germans: I’m thinking of the late Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber in Die Hard and, sticking with the same franchise, Jeremy Irons as Gruber’s no less evil brother in Die Hard With a Vengeance. If you’re casting a Nazi in Hollywood, the chances are you’ll call a Brit."

This new addition to the genre comes from New York magazine’s blog Grub Street, and tackles the big issues in fine and not-so-fine dining, from the rise of the chicken sandwich to where to find the perfect martini. Unsurprisingly, the focus is on NYC’s eating scene, but given that the city tends to lead the way when it comes to food trends – from Shake Shack to the cronut – that’s not necessarily a bad thing for the forward-thinking foodie.

Channel 4 News’s Matt Frei, formerly the BBC’s man in Washington, is well-placed to put Trump’s rise into context, and here follows the White House hopeful on a campaign trail that’s part Nigel Farage, part PT Barnum. Of course, the temptation with Trump is to point and laugh, but there’s much to be troubled by, from his divisive rhetoric to his attacks on those who dare question his credentials, as evidenced here with testimony from former breakfast TV host Selina Scott.

TV: Lemmy - In His Own Words
We’re still waiting for the definitive posthumous doc on the Motörhead frontman, who died in December. But this iPlayer-only one-off should fill the gap. Made up of interviews and performance footage, it shows Lemmy at his rowdy, cantankerous and, yes, rocking best.

For the first time in its 11-year run, Come Dine With Me featured a competitor who, cracking under the strain, chucked his guests out of his home after finding he’d lost the competition. It’s a glorious achievement for Peter from Milton Keynes, who will also be forever remembered for being part of the finest piece of daytime television ever broadcast, a show that condenses competitive entitlement and aspirational anxiety into a 30-minute comedy of manners which delights all senses (at 3 o’clock in the afternoon, anyway). But despite Peter’s heroic action – striking back for all the other losers who grin and bear it as a victor chucks a salver full of £20 notes into the faces of people who’d cooked them dinner for a week and quite frankly got sod all thanks for it, actually – he is still a loser. Had he held it together, he might have been in with a chance of appearing on Come Dine With Me: Champion Of Champions (Monday, 5pm, Channel 4).
In a radical departure from the usual format, this new series (CDWMCoC to its friends) brings beloved narrator Dave Lamb out of the voiceover booth – I’ll be honest, I wasn’t expecting him in a cravat – and into what is supposedly his kitchen in a large country house. There, he hosts three winners from previous series in a programme that can only be described as a complex combination of cooking competition and retrospective. Be assured, there is a clear distinction.
In the first heat, the competitors are erotic novelist Jude (remember her?), Anil from north London (surely you haven’t forgotten Anil), and a thoroughly nice sales and marketing manager from Bristol called Ronnie whose face, among the thousands of others just like her, I know you can instantly call to mind. Dave is joined for the judging process by restaurateur and Saturday Kitchen regular Glynn Purnell, as well as an assortment of historic runners-up.
In the heat of the competition, things don’t look good for Ronnie. In the original show, points are awarded less for what you cook and more on whether the Zinfandel is flowing, if your cutlery has recently seen the business end of a scrubby, and whether any of your guests started bitter rows between courses. This leaves the winning spot open to people – and I cast no aspersions on Ronnie’s culinary finesse here – whose main talents include “being inoffensive” and “doesn’t possess a jacuzzi or the belief you should get in it, in a bathing suit that hasn’t seen the light of day since 1993, on television”.
In CDWMCoC though, the food is actually important. Courses are done away with in favour of challenges, which for Ronnie means making Jude’s Coca Xira, AKA octopus pie, without a recipe and against the clock. Keen viewers won’t miss the smiley face pressed indelicately into the pie’s crust, a flourish I’m sure is Ronnie’s homage to the early days of the show and to a dish called Leftovers Pie. Back then you could innocently enter a television cooking programme, dash whatever shit you had in the back of the fridge into a Pyrex and spruce it up with a bit of freeform pastry. To pull that stunt today would mark your card as someone barely capable of looking after themselves and exceptionally undeserving of a thousand quid in your back pocket.
As much as this new format may have changed some things, other CDWM delights remain constant. It’s amazing how much you can tell about a person when they have to do a big shop for critical eaters, get their nails done, prepare a three-course meal and have a quick go round the skirting boards with the hoover, all the while trying to look relaxed and convivial. These conditions truly show what a person is made of. I judge them harshly: on the pomposity of their menus, on their sofas, on their parochial mohawks, and how eagerly they walk into middle-aged flirtation (always a danger with suburban dinner parties). In these circumstances, Jude is flourishing. “Ronnie’’ll have problems with the cock-ooh-jeera,” she says with a certain glint in her eye. “May the best one win.”"
Life and style|Katharine Whitehorn column,2016-02-01T11:00:02,guardian,Katharine Whitehorn,What does being in fashion really mean after a certain age?

Katharine Whitehorn on stylish seniors
A colleague has expressed an interest in how older females deal with the immortal problems of their appearance: coping with hair and skin and deciding what clothes look right for what occasion – what to buy and where.
I suppose she is right to assume we would not tackle such things in the same way as once we would have done – and not just because we have got older. For one thing, if we think back long enough Paris really did set the scene: Dior launched the New Look with his unimaginably longer skirts – at the first press show he was reassured by an aide saying, “It’s all right, they’re pulling at their hems.”
There used to be more things like “the colour of the year”, as well as a given length of skirts. And way back then there was even, in Vogue, specific advice for “Mrs Exeter”, who was assumed to be at least middle aged. There is no such advice now.
Of course those writing about fashion do get irritated letters from seniors about the wrong length, or the lack of buttons or zips where they used to be. But by and large there’s enough variety available for them – I mean us – to be able to find something that suits. And that is what really matters, rather than being in fashion. Just as important, of course, is that it keeps us warm, though Browning didn’t actually say:
“Grow old along with me!
The vest is yet to be.”
At a posh event I went to recently there were several women of a certain age who had the right elegant clothes, but fashionably long, loose hair which simply didn’t work with their wrinkled skin. It isn’t just a matter about what is good in Vogue as what looks good on us – or at least what we hope does.

Squash|Willstrop's World|US sports|features,2016-02-01T11:50:48,guardian,James Willstrop,"Squash crowds are different in every country but, unlike fans of other sports, they never let their passion for the sport turn into ugly and hateful invective",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/willstrop-s-world/2016/feb/01/squash-fans-grand-central-station-new-york-canary-wharf,"In praise of squash fans, who are graceful from Grand Central to London to Egypt",en,sport|US sports,,"Squash crowds are different in every country but, unlike fans of other sports, they never let their passion for the sport turn into ugly and hateful invective
The big venues in the world of sport bring intrigue and excitement to fans and athletes alike. Wimbledon, Lord’s, Wembley, Old Trafford, the MCG, the Stade de France, Twickenham, those exclusive golf courses that exclude women, Elland Road. Sorry, I lost my way there. I’m from Yorkshire.
What often helps is the history and tradition of the place, sometimes more so than the aesthetics or modernity of the venue. The most unlikely places can make for the most captivating sporting arenas. The audiences not only wonder at the sporting occasion they have come to witness, but hark back in their imaginations to sporting events of yesteryear.
In squash one event in particular has more pull than any other. It’s the one that recently finished in New York, the Tournament of Champions. Years ago tournament director John Nimick had a vision that must have made people laugh at the time, so fantastical it was. This vision was to place the glass court in the middle of one of the most recognised and beautiful buildings in the world, Grand Central Terminal.
When the court is built and the audience is in place, the incredible acoustics somehow create a crackling atmosphere. Tickets are sold in the main arena but there is a standing viewing area around the back of the front wall where anyone can watch, allowing passing commuters to look on for free.

Fifteen years on and Nimick’s vision, now reality, is unrivalled in squash and he has probably provided better exposure for the sport than any PR exercise ever could. For the first time this year the tournament awarded equal prize money for men and women, like many of the sport’s current major events.
In spring there are some top drawer competitions that are among my favourites of the year. In March the men play in another classy venue in Canary Wharf. There are definite similarities between it and New York and they somehow both capture perfectly that big city bustle, oozing an atmosphere that makes them such a pleasure to play. It’s no fluke that these two events are run by some of the finest tournament planners and directors in squash, Nimick and Tim Garner, a former world professional player.
As good as these venues are for athletes, they are perhaps made special by the audience more than anything else. The two events have such thrilled and thrilling crowds who really involve themselves in the action. It always helps if there is a VIP section that provides competitively priced and strong alcoholic options, something John and Tim both accommodate. There are certain characters, who when behind the red rope, bring a vociferous element to proceedings, which can only be a good thing for many of the players. Being able to lean on or bounce off an audience in the depths of a punishing match is a stirring boon.
I feel very lucky to be involved in a sport where the audiences are such a pleasure to play for. At the World Championships in Seattle in the autumn the fans seemed excited to see a level of squash on their doorstep that they are seldom exposed to because of geography, and the players responded. US audiences often have an encouraging and warm way about them; they want the combat and the conflict but they take an honest line. You get to know exactly how they feel about the action and the competitors.
British audiences are different: quieter perhaps, more thoughtful, but still enthusiastic and appreciative. Theirs is a more intense consideration of what unravels in front of them, as might be expected. In Egypt, a powerhouse in the world of squash, things are wildly different. It can be more chaotic, less ordered, even rowdy if their man takes to the court, but no less charming at times. Each country and venue has their own singular audience.
The last football match I had the pleasure of seeing made me somewhat sympathetic (yes, that’s right) towards footballers, after I sat through an hour and a half of their own fans shouting obscenities at them and telling them to “fuck off” back to a rival team. It’s probably best not to go into what was said to the officials.

Sitting in a rugby league crowd at Headingley last season was a similarly toxic experience. The players tried their best, worked hard and, as far as I could see, gave everything for their team, taking punishing hits to the body that would have instantly concussed or hospitalised most of the fried-food brigade in the stands. The effort and standard the teams produced should have been appreciated and applauded. But the negativity from the fans – who slagged them off so viciously at any opportunity as if it was what they wanted to spend their time doing – was dispiriting.
I imagined these delusional fans confronted with the athletes they were sledging, such as Kevin Sinfield, and asking them to say it to their face. But of course that’s exactly why they feel vindicated to stand there criticising, because they never will have to deal with such a scenario. I don’t hear Sinfield ever complaining or criticising anyone about their work, or complaining about those fans criticising him, so that’s why I’m doing it for him. Presumably this acrid invective only surfaces in these people while they are on the terraces. Surely, within their lives as engineers, bus drivers, estate agents, or parents, they would not be inclined to speak to anyone in that way.
Cricket serves up diatribes from crowd and players alike, yet on the whole seems to have found a reasonable balance. There is a light-hearted mickey-taking element but it tends to be more humorous than hateful. The crowds at big tennis events never fail to create atmosphere, but neither will they be shouting insults to Roger Federer about his family, or telling the umpire he is a tosser. Indeed, it’s absolutely laughable to think of the Pimms quaffers at SW19 shouting obscenities at players.
Laura Massaro's rise to world No1 is another exciting development for squash Read more
Some people will justify the crowd behaviour in football and rugby league by saying it’s something to do with passion, but if I had anything to do with these sports I would be making moves to stamp this out. It might be old-fashioned to say it but neutrals don’t want to listen to disdainful fans verbally caning every player on the pitch gratuitously.
It’s great to have conflict, passion, anger and disgust in sport, but gratuitous and hateful insults thrown at players and officials is grotesque. If anything of the sort happened in a whole raft of other sports, these fans would be ejected from the arena. It’s unthinkable for crowds to scream and shout in such base terms at a swimming meet, a table tennis or hockey match, but football fans must sit within stadiums so often that they become immune to how vile the atmosphere really is.
So, as squash players reflect on another Tournament Of Champions in New York, we can be grateful for the audiences we enjoy in the classy squash venues all over the world. Of course they have opinions and criticise players – and they have every right to that – but they do it with grace and not hate.

NFL|Seattle Seahawks|US sports|match reports,2016-02-01T11:57:48,guardian,Associated Press In Honolulu,"With no Super Bowl trip this season for the Seattle Seahawks, their stars came to play — and dominate — at the Pro Bowl",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/01/russell-wilson-throws-three-touchdowns-at-pro-bowl-and-earns-offensive-mvp,Russell Wilson throws three touchdowns at Pro Bowl and earns offensive MVP,en,sport|US sports,,"With no Super Bowl trip this season for the Seattle Seahawks, their stars came to play — and dominate — at the Pro Bowl.
Russell Wilson threw three first-half touchdown passes to lead Team Irvin to a 49-27 victory over Team Rice on Sunday and earn offensive MVP honors at Aloha Stadium. Seattle team-mate Michael Bennett was the defensive MVP after having the game’s only sack and deflecting a pass.
“To see us Seahawks out there is a real special thing,” Wilson said. “It’s a testament to our hard work and to see two Seahawks out there as MVPs is really cool.”
The Seahawks quarterback, who was the first player picked in the all-star game’s draft, went eight of 12 for 164 yards. He led scoring drives on three of Team Irvin’s first four possessions. Wilson threw touchdown passes of 14 and two yards to Atlanta Falcons team-mates Julio Jones and Devonta Freeman, respectively, in the opening quarter. Early in the second quarter, Wilson connected with Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley for a 10-yard score.
The teams were drafted and captained by Hall of Fame wide receivers Michael Irvin and Jerry Rice. Winston Moss, Green Bay’s assistant head coach and linebackers coach, filled in for the ill Mike McCarthy and coached Team Irvin. Kansas City’s Andy Reid led Team Rice.
A record 47 players declined to participate in this year’s Pro Bowl, either due to injury or for personal reasons, or couldn’t play because their teams are in the Super Bowl. Carolina had 10 players selected, including quarterback Cam Newton, while Denver had four, including defensive stars Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware.
Wilson was the lone quarterback originally selected to participate in the game.
“Any time you have the opportunity to play the great game of football, you take advantage of the opportunity,” Wilson said. “Playing in the Pro Bowl is a special thing because to be able to see all the amazing players across the league, who are the best players in the world and to be able to play on one field together is a really, really cool thing.”
Bennett was busy on defense, but played one snap at quarterback late in the game and picked up seven yards on a rush. He said it was his first experience under center in his career. “Only in my dreams,” Bennett said with a laugh.
Two other Seahawks players mixed it up midway through the third quarter when Team Irvin’s Richard Sherman — a cornerback — was dropped for a 22-yard loss on a reverse by Team Rice linebacker Bobby Wagner. “He said that he knew what he was going to do,” Sherman said. “He knew I was getting the ball and he knew he was making the tackle.”
Minnesota’s Teddy Bridgewater and Tampa Bay’s Jameis Winston each added two TD passes for Team Irvin. Jacksonville’s Allen Robinson, Tennessee’s Delanie Walker, Philadelphia’s Darren Sproles and Houston’s DeAndre Hopkins had scoring receptions.
Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce caught two scoring passes for Team Rice. Miami’s Jarvis Landry also had a TD catch, and Tampa Bay’s Doug Martin ran for a score.
The half-time festivities included a parade of local high school football players. Tennessee Titans rookie quarterback Marcus Mariota, a Honolulu native, led his alma mater, Saint Louis School, onto the field during the procession and was greeted by loud cheers from the sellout crowd of 50,000.
It was the 35th time the NFL’s annual all-star game was played at Aloha Stadium dating to 1980, and the third consecutive season that it has used an “unconferenced” format. The game was played at in Glendale, Arizona, last year. The site of next year’s Pro Bowl has not yet been determined by the NFL, although it does have an option to return to Hawaii.
It was the final game of Oakland safety Charles Woodson’s 18-year career. He was escorted by his two young sons off the field to rousing cheers from the fans that remained.

Such a cool moment. #ProBowl pic.twitter.com/U1iuj8BNBq
“I really got all the emotions out of the way a few weeks back, but this one is just the icing on the cake for me to be able to make the Pro Bowl, be able to bring my family over here and hang out in Hawaii,” Woodson said. “It’s been great.”"

Three officials banned for life by the IAAF for blackmailing athletes and covering up positive drugs tests have appealed against the sanctions to the court of arbitration for sport.
Papa Massata Diack, the son of the former IAAF president Lamine Diack and a marketing consultant for the organisation, former Russian athletics federation (Araf) president and IAAF treasurer Valentin Balakhnichev, and Alexei Melnikov, a senior Araf coach, were handed the life bans on 7 January. The IAAF’s ethics commission found that the trio had blackmailed Russian runner Liliya Shobukhova, London marathon winner in 2010, and made her pay a bribe for a positive drugs test to be covered up.
French police have issued an international wanted notice via Interpol for Diack junior over corruption allegations, while his father is also the subject of a police investigation over allegations of receiving money to cover up positive tests.
A statement from Cas released on Monday read: “Three appeals have been filed at the court of arbitration for sport (Cas) against the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) ethics commission decision dated January 7, 2016.
“Valentin Balakhnichev, former president of the All-Russia Athletic Federation (Araf), Alexei Melnikov, former chief ARAF coach for long-distance walkers and runners, and Papa Massata Diack, former marketing consultant to the IAAF, all seek to have their life bans from involvement in the sport of track and field annulled.
“Cas arbitration procedures are in progress. The Cas will not comment any further at this time.”"

Aung San Suu Kyi chose to enter parliament through a small side entrance, and sat expressionless at the front corner with a muted appearance that belied the extraordinary significance of the quarter-century struggle she had led to get here.
Myanmar’s lower house was blanketed in light orange, the colour worn by her National League for Democracy (NLD) party members, who now have a majority in parliament after decades of military-dominated rule.
Aung San Suu Kyi's party takes seats in historic session of Myanmar parliament Read more
In the next few months, Aung San Suu Kyi is set to form a government, push through legislation and fulfil her vision for the historically oppressive and autocratic country. In 1990, a sweeping NLD victory at the polls was annulled by the junta and Aung San Suu Kyi was put under house arrest in her family’s villa by Yangon’s Inya lake, together with many of her allies.
On Monday, with jasmine flowers in her hair and the party’s peacock pattern on her longyi dress, Aung San Suu Kyi watched quietly as her choice of speaker and deputy speaker were installed.
In the wake of the November election win, she warned supporters to be humble and remain wary of the military’s tendency to intervene when it feels threatened.But on Monday, U Win Htein, a party spokesman who spent years in prison himself, struck an optimistic note. “We have been struggling for democracy since 1988,” he said. “We have suffered very much but now we see the results and the fruits of our suffering. It is a beautiful beginning.”
Win Htein said there were 110 former political prisoners among the 390 NLD candidates elected to both houses of parliament. Their jail terms often spanned more than two decades. Many were released only a few years ago, when power was handed over to a semi-civilian reformist government backed by the military and led by the president, Thein Sein. Those reforms led to the November election.

In parliament on Monday, officials from the military – which is granted a quarter of the seats in accordance to the junta-drafted constitution – were seated in light green on the right side of parliament. While most seats were taken by the NLD, also present were representatives from ethnic parties who had won constituencies: men and women wearing hats and colourful jackets from the northern states of Kachin and Shan, or the simple Burmese longyi skirt in different patterns.
NLD member Ma Thandar, who spent six years in prison, joined other MPs in the lower house. “It is a wonderful feeling to be here. I want to fight for the people, for their human rights,” she told the Guardian.
Her husband, a journalist, was shot dead while in army custody in 2014.“I miss my husband and his spirit will be here with me,” she said.
Ma Thandar is set to work with the same people she accuses of taking her husband’s life, but said she had no hate. “I want to work together for the good of the country. I can shake hands with them, but I don’t know if they will shake hands with us. We have been smiling at them [here in the parliament] but they don’t smile back.”
Aung San Suu Kyi will have to share power with the military, which retains three key ministries and a veto on constitutional changes. She is barred from taking the country’s most powerful position herself but her party’s overwhelming majority in both houses of parliament allows her to handpick the president.
Poverty, ethnic tensions and China top agenda for Myanmar's new politicians Read more
In the 2010 election which was widely dismissed as fraudulent and boycotted by the NLD, the Union Solidarity and Development party (USDP) – the political group of the former military commander and current president Thein Sein – came to power. Thein Sein was credited with releasing political prisoners, ending censorship, seeking peace with ethnic minority militants and paving the way towards credible elections.
Last week, he called on political parties to work together. “Our government will help the new government,” he said, praising the transition.
Than Soe, a USDP MP, said on Monday: “There are no hard feelings. We accepted the people’s choice.”
Richard Horsey, an analyst based in Yangon and a former United Nations official, said the military’s conciliatory attitude reflected an economic choice. “Democracy has not been the driving force of this transition,” he said. “It’s about liberalisation and opening up Myanmar to the global economy, and this is why it will continue.” Foreign brands have flooded into the country since reforms started in 2011.
Despite the symbolic importance of Monday’s session, the real political shift will happen at the end of March, when a new government will be formed and the new president will take over from Thein Sein. “This is when the tricky bit starts,” said Horsey.
“The people have changed but the challenges are the same. And Aung San Suu Kyi will have, for example, to confront the situation [of the Muslim minority] in Rakhine as one of her priorities.”
Aung San Suu Kyi has been criticised for not speaking out more strongly on the plight of the persecuted Burmese Muslims, many of whom were unable to vote. She has vowed that the first priority of the government will be national reconciliation – not only with the military but also with half a dozen ethnic groups still fighting in the border areas.
A peace agreement was signed in October by eight out of 15 armed groups. However, clashes between non-signatory groups and the military have continued until recently.
Aung Win, 70, another NLD member, said he joined the military when he was 16. In 1988, during student protests, he left the army and spent two years in jail. He fought against ethnic insurgent militias, many of which are still battling the government for autonomy.
“I saw the dead bodies on the ground, wearing poor clothes and uniforms. It was not their fault and I realised we were fighting against our own people,” he said. “I did not want to do that.”
For Aung Win, the main challenge has already been won. “I cannot describe what we feel about Aung San Suu Kyi,” he said. “Today would never have been possible without her.”"

Expectations were running sky high as Myanmar’s first democratically elected parliament in more than 50 years, dominated by the former opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), convened for the first time on Monday tasked with choosing the country’s next president.
After decades of stultifying military rule, all the talk was of a new era and a fresh start. “They [the people] hope that every problem will be solved automatically after the NLD becomes the government,” said Shwe Mann, the outgoing speaker of parliament.
But the challenges ahead – political, practical, structural and strategic – are daunting. Myanmar remains riven by ethnic conflict involving, among others, the Shan, Karen, Kachin and Lisu peoples. Taken all together, minorities comprise about 40% of the population of 52 million, and most feel disadvantaged to some degree.
The outgoing president, Thein Sein, signed a national ceasefire agreement last October with eight leading armed groups. But fighting continues in many states, where local people seek greater autonomy and expanded rights over resources. Significant problems persist concerning political prisoners and minority activists held without trial.
Ending abuse of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state, and the broader issue of how to curb Buddhist chauvinism, are other urgent issues. Most Rohingya were barred from voting and, for the first time since independence, they have no MP in parliament, the Burma Campaign UK pressure group said.

The NLD, led by national icon and Nobel peace prizewinner Aung San Suu Kyi, is not best placed to address this problem. It admitted before the election that Muslim candidates had been struck off its lists after pressure from nationalists.
Even with the national parliament in place, the unusually long transition to civilian rule is far from complete. An NLD-led government has yet to be installed. Most of the new MPs from whom the new administration must be drawn lack political experience. State and regional assemblies have yet to start work.
The new president will not take over until April. It will not be Aung San Suu Kyi, and her future role remains shrouded in uncertainty. Despite an 80% popular mandate measured in parliamentary votes, she is barred from the highest office due to an arbitrary constitutional prohibition engineered by the former junta.
Aung San Suu Kyi has said she will nevertheless be in charge, acting “above the president”, but it is unclear how this will work. She has so far given no indication as to who will take over from Thein Sein, and the NLD has no clear number two.
Constitutional gerrymandering by the Tatmadaw – the military – means it retains de facto control of key security ministries, including borders and defence. In a national crisis, as defined by the generals, the military has a legal right to take control of the government, including management of the economy.
The longer these uncertainties continue, the more drawn out the transition, and the more difficulty the NLD government faces in implementing new policies, the greater will be the impatience of voters for Aung San Suu Kyi to fulfil her mandate to bring real change.

As if this were not all difficult enough, Myanmar faces acute problems of poverty and child malnourishment, ramshackle education and healthcare systems, and a chronic lack of modern infrastructure. The legacy of social division and inter-communal distrust is formidable and will take years to overcome.
The NLD must also struggle with complicated strategic challenges. For years, China was the Tatmadaw’s closest friend and ally. In return for turning a blind eye to political illegitimacy and human rights abuses, Beijing gained access to cheap natural resources and lucrative contracts, such as the now halted Myitsone dam project.
The US and EU, in contrast, championed the pro-democracy cause, maintaining sanctions on the junta. Even so, her overriding need to keep the army onside may lead Aung San Suu Kyi towards an accommodation with China, even if it means alienating the west.
While Aung San Suu Kyi has adopted positions that are generally receptive to China’s interests, to the dismay of some supporters, the Chinese government has stirred up low-level trouble in some border areas in order to gain leverage and make the army appear indispensable, according to Min Zin, an analyst.
“Several political and military officials in Myanmar and intelligence officers in Yunnan [said] they expect Beijing and the NLD to strike some kind of arrangement after the NLD forms a new government in a few months,” Min Zin wrote.
“China would press ethnic rebel groups to cooperate with the NLD on a national ceasefire accord, handing Aung San Suu Kyi a victory that has eluded the current government. In exchange, the NLD would yield to important Chinese interests in Myanmar, such as major infrastructure and investment projects.”
Myanmar’s so far limited democratic renaissance already has the full support of the west. But in order to maintain the fragile internal political balance, both Aung San Suu Kyi and the Tatmadaw require the support of China, the regional superpower.
If either of Myanmar’s two major power groupings – the NLD or the military – feels it is losing ground to the other, it is to Beijing, not Washington or Brussels, that they will turn. Given China’s disdain for democracy and open societies, this level of influence is not an encouraging prospect for Myanmar."
India|LGBT rights|Human rights|South and Central Asia|news,2016-02-01T15:52:48,guardian,Vidhi Doshi In Mumbai,"Indian supreme court to rule on colonial-era penal code that bans gay sex, after 2013 judgment reversed years of gradual liberalisation",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/01/indian-lgbt-activists-vigils-court-rules-anti-gay-law,Indian LGBT activists hold vigils before court rules on anti-gay law,en,world,,"Gay rights organisations are holding vigils and demonstrations in the Indian capital ahead of a supreme court ruling that could decriminalise homosexuality.
The three most senior judges of the Indian supreme court in Delhi will rule on Tuesday on a previous judgment from 2013, which reinstated colonial-era legislation that in effect outlawed gay sex. That decision stunned many in India, overturning decades of slow progress and prompting protests.
Sexual relations have become a battleground in India, often revealing cultural splits between generations, between urban and rural dwellers, and between those who invoke a “traditional past” supposedly uncontaminated by western influences and those who stress a local history of pluralism and tolerance.
Indian LGBT activists outraged as supreme court reinstates gay sex ban Read more
Anjali Gopalan, executive director of an HIV/Aids advocacy organisation called the Naz Foundation who filed the petition to strike out the key laws, said decriminalisation was “the least that can be done”.
She said: “Section 377 is a remnant of our colonial past. Now even the UK has decriminalised it, so why should we hold on to it?”
A high court had previously legalised homosexuality, in 2009. Gopalan said that decision dramatically changed public attitudes. “After 2009, gay rights issues could no longer be swept under the carpet. It opened the door to talking about the issue in the media,” she said.
The decision to recriminalise homesexuality in 2013 came after a legal campaign by a coalition of conservatives including Muslim and Christian religious associations, a rightwing politician and a retired government official turned astrologist.
The supreme court is known for its broadly progressive judgments that often order politicians or officials to respect the rights of the poor, disadvantaged or marginalised communities.
Gay rights activists have said the community faces significant discrimination and police harassment, even if prosecutions for same-sex activity have been rare. Criminalising homosexuality makes them vulnerable to blackmail, they say.
Shashi Bhooshan, a gay rights activist, said he was hopeful for a favourable verdict on Tuesday. “All the big media organisations are talking about civil liberties and human rights, so I wouldn’t be surprised if the court ruled in our favour,” he said.
“I feel excited and nervous for tomorrow. If we get a good verdict, it will be a big step forward and give me security as a citizen of this country. How can I be living in the world’s biggest democracy in 2016 and still be denied a fundamental human right?
“Right now, I am considered a criminal. There’s a fear around it, a social stigma. But it becomes easier to change people’s minds if the law is on your side. It is easier to explain to them that you’re not doing anything wrong, that you’re normal.”
Bhooshan volunteers with the Naz Foundation to spread awareness about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. “Almost every day I hear about LGBT people being harassed by the police,” he said. “We get arrested just for distributing leaflets – police say they are arresting us for encouraging illegal and immoral activities.”
Defenders of the 2013 supreme court decision said the objections of the judges to the repeal of section 377, which is the key clause on “unnatural offences”, were “constitutional and legal, not moral”.
Vikram Seth: India's gay sex ban is against our tradition of tolerance Read more
However, critics said that the wording of the judgment – which referred to the “so-called rights of LGBT persons”, described same-sex relations as “against the order of nature” and said that “lesbians, gays, bisexuals or transgenders constitute only a miniscule fraction of the country’s population” – revealed deep prejudices.
Vikram Seth, one of India’s best-known novelists, described the court’s decision as showing an “intellectual shabbiness and ethical hollowness” that went against the true culture of an enormously diverse country.
“We are each of us in some way – by caste, gender, sexuality, language or religion – a minority, and the great achievement of the Indian polity over three generations is that somehow or other we have kept together as a nation,” Seth, 63, told the Guardian at the time.
Krishtulshyan, an activist from a group called the Indian LGBT Community based in Bihar, in eastern India, said she knew people who had travelled to other countries to get married and others who had killed themselves after suffering abuse for being gay.
“It would be like heaven for us if the court rules in our favour,” she said. “No one is open about it. They’re afraid of what society will think. There’s many cases of people getting removed from college for being gay, or not getting jobs because of it. If it’s legalised, all that will stop.”
For Krishtulshyan, too, Tuesday’s decision could be life-changing. “If I get the right to live freely, I will tell my family that I want to marry my girlfriend,” she said. “If it’s legal then nobody can stop us or put us in jail for being together.”"

After half a century of military-dominated rule, Aung San Suu Kyi has led her National League for Democracy (NLD) party into Myanmar’s parliament, taking a majority of seats and starting the process of installing a democratically elected government.
Aung San Suu Kyi has waited more than 25 years for this moment, having won a parliamentary majority in 1990 that was annulled by the military leadership. In November last year, she led the NLD to another landslide victory that has been accepted by the outgoing army-aligned government.
Aung San Suu Kyi wins outright majority in Myanmar election Read more
Hundreds of NLD parliamentarians, many of them former political prisoners during successive military regimes, took their seats in the lower house on Monday morning. The party won 80% of all electable positions during a general election in November, with the military reserving a quarter of total seats.
The Nobel peace prize laureate, flowers in her hair, avoided hordes of reporters in the capital Nay Pyi Taw when she used a side entrance to enter the parliament. Her NLD lawmakers wore orange, overshadowing the military’s light green in the house.
Aung San Suu Kyi did not comment as she entered parliament.
U Min Oo, an NLD MP from Bago constituency, said the day felt very special.
“It’s the second time I have been elected but this time it feels different, because the NLD is majority. It’s an overwhelming majority, but we all come from different backgrounds and we can guarantee diversity.”
Win Myint, a close aide to Aung San Suu Kyi and NLD MP, was sworn in as house speaker. But T Khun Myat, member of the outgoing government USDP party, was also elected as deputy speaker in a sign of the political pragmatism the NLD leader has adopted in recent years.

President Thein Sein, a former general who implemented gradual reforms since 2011, will stand down in March or April when an NLD president takes over.
While Aung San Suu Kyi is barred by an army-drafted constitution from taking the country’s most powerful position, her overwhelming majority in both houses of parliament allows her to handpick the president from her loyalist circles.
Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent years under house arrest, has said the NLD victory places her “above the president”. She will likely announce her candidate, who will act as a proxy, later this month.
The military and its allies in government have repeatedly and publicly stated they will abide the results.

However, the most powerful ministerial positions – home, defence and border affairs – will be reserved for Myanmar’s armed forces, or Tatmadaw, giving the generals continued power in the south-east Asian nation.
Despite that, Roland Kobia, the EU ambassador to Myanmar, said the nation was on track to true democracy.
“Myanmar is step by step confirming its aspiration to a real democratic change and to a genuinely new political direction,” he said.
“A lot still needs to be done, but meaningful progress can happen through the commitment of the Myanmar people and political will of its leaders.”"

North Korean tour guides lead visitors through the regime’s latest cultural showpiece, a grand new panorama museum reported to have cost $24m.
The museum’s showpiece is a 120m long, 13m high, 360° mural painted by the country’s lauded Mansudae studio artists.
But this isn’t Pyongyang and the mural does not depict scenes of heroism by the ruling Kim dynasty. Instead the museum is in Siem Reap in Cambodia, a stone’s throw from the world heritage site of Angkor Wat but thousands of miles from the seat of the DPRK regime, and the paintings depict the Angkor era of 802 -1431.
Part grand design and part diplomacy project, the Angkor Panorama museum, which opened in December, is the latest cultural export North Korea hopes will bring in much-needed funds for its struggling economy.

The ambitious centrepiece echoes the panoramic paintings at the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War museum in Pyongyang – minus the North Korean propaganda.
Walking the circular viewing deck, visitors start with horrific scenes from the Cham War between the Khmers and the Vietnamese before moving on to the construction of the famous Bayon Temple and ending with the daily life of Khmers.
Surrounding the viewing deck is an artificial jungle constructed from fake trees, rocks, huts and sculptures which seamlessly meets the painted wall.
Originally from Pyongyang, the tour guide explains that a “merited artist” from Mansudae, North Korea’s biggest art studio in Pyongyang, was responsible for the main piece, but that it took 63 artists almost two years to complete.
But the state-run studio, which employs 4,000 people, is no stranger to creating gigantic works of art: its artists have built almost every statue, sculpture and piece of propagandist art currently on show North Korea.

Lucrative asset
Its international division, the Mansudae Overseas Projects Group, is a thriving multi-million dollar business bringing in much needed funds to the isolated regime.
A host of foreign governments have requested their own grandiose, often propaganda-themed projects. Mansudae commissions include Botswana’s Three Dikgosi Monument; Senegal’s African Renaissance monument; Namibia’s Heroes’ Acre; Benin’s King Behazin’s Statue and the Democratic Republic of Congo’s statue of former dictator, Laurent Kabila.
Other projects have included Angola’s Agostino Neto Mausoleum, which is reported to have cost $55m, and two statues of Robert Mugabe thought to have cost Zimbabwe $5m. The group also contributed panoramic murals to Syria’s October War Museum.
Special relationship
Ever since the 1940s, when Kim Il-sung and Cambodia’s Norodom Sihanouk first became friends, the two countries have historically enjoyed a special relationship.

But though in recent times this seems to have waned – with Hun Sen’s current government favouring investment from South Korea – Cambodia hasn’t cut ties with the DPRK completely.
Last year the country was reported to have banned The Interview, an American comedy about Kim Jong-un, after pressure from the North, and though the Angkor Panorama Museum is the first cultural project of its kind, North Koreans have run “Pyongyang” themed restaurants in Siem Reap and the capital Phnom Penh for years.
“I believe that Angkor Panorama Museum, one of the symbols of friendship and cooperation between the DPRK and the Kingdom of Cambodia, will contribute to further consolidate our traditional friendship,” said Hong Ki-chol, the North Korean ambassador to Cambodia.
The official statement from Cambodia’s deputy prime minister Sok An added that the museum would be a valuable contribution to their tourist industry and help strengthen “friendship and cooperation between the two nations.”

Kickbacks
With North Korea heavily sanctioned after a series of provocative nuclear tests in recent years, foreign trade is exceptionally hard for the regime to come by.
But projects like the panorama museum may help bridge the gap. According to the the construction deal, North Korea will manage and operate the site for the next 10 years, after which it will be transferred to the Cambodian authority that oversees the Angkor province and archaeological site. Profits from the sale of tickets, souvenirs and the cafe will be split evenly.
“The museum is sure to produce hard currency the regime needs to sustain itself,” says Greg Scarlatoiu from the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea.
Scarlatoiu added that the investment was ironic, given that “many of North Korea’s own cultural heritage assets are in a very precarious state.” These include the listed Koguryo tombs; the caves in Kujang and Kaesong, the old capital of the Koryo kingdom.

Visitors?
But has North Korea done enough to bring in revenue? The crowds were thin on the ground when the museum first opened to visitors and journalists last month, and the the Japan Times recently reported that only 30 people were coming through the doors per day.
Foreign visitors, who didn’t want to give their full names, also had mixed feelings.
Phil from the UK felt that it exceeded expectations. “The panorama is brilliantly done. The animated movie is a good introduction to Khmer history, although some of it is dubious. The museum is probably a nice addition for tourists, but it is also excessive in a way.”
Lily, from Serbia, said that though “it was a nice representation, I do feel the price of $15 is a bit pricey, especially for Cambodians.”
Neil, also from the UK, added: “The panorama is impressive, but with the main Angkor temples a few kilometres away, the trip may not be worth it for most tourists.”

An elderly Chinese farmer who has lived through famine, civil war, revolution and one of the greatest economic booms in history has spoken of his delight at becoming an unlikely international fashion icon in his twilight years.
Ding Bingcai, 85, was catapulted into the headlines last month after his photographer grandson, Ding Guoliang, 30, made him the star of a fashion shoot for which he donned green, blue and mulberry suits, tartan bow ties, designer glasses and fedoras.
Photographs of the dapper grandfather-of-10 – who had never before worn a suit – quickly went viral with internet users anointing him “China’s coolest grandpa”.
One Chinese newspaper claimed the octogenarian trendsetter had achieved world-class levels of charm.
The English-language edition of the People’s Daily, the Communist party’s official mouthpiece, gushed: “The old man is totally turned into a heartthrob.”

Speaking on Monday with the help of his grandson, Ding said he had enjoyed his unforeseen transformation from farmer to fashionista.
“They are beautiful,” the softly spoken grandfather said of his grandson’s viral photographs.
The retired farmer said he was unable to pick his favourite look from his menswear collection. “I like all of them,” he told the Guardian.

Even more remarkable than Ding’s rise to fashion fame are the staggering social and political upheavals he has witnessed during his life.
Ding was born in 1931, six years after the death of China’s first president, Sun Yat-sen, and almost two decades before Chairman Mao’s communists seized power in 1949.
He grew up in Songshuping, a rural village on the outskirts of Fujian province’s Shaowu city and became a subsistence farmer, growing rice and cutting bamboo for a living.

Ding was in his late twenties when Mao’s Great Leap Forward push for industrialisation caused a calamitous famine that devastated rural China and is thought to have claimed up to 45 million lives.
“It was very hard in the past,” Ding recalled of those days. “Before, I didn’t have enough food to eat. [We were] always starving. Back then, we had no money. Things are much better now.”

In 1961, as the three-year Great Famine came to an end, Ding married his childhood sweetheart, Zhang Jiyu. Over the coming years the couple had five children; two daughters and three sons.
Today, China’s most glamorous grandfather boasts 10 grandchildren spread between the eastern cities of Xiamen, Shanghai and Fuzhou. His wife passed away in 2014.
Ding Guoliang, a professional photographer who uses the name Jesse, said the three-day photo session, which took place last September on the streets of Xiamen, was intended to make his grandfather feel both useful and elegant.

“He looks amazing in the pictures,” the photographer told the China Daily in an earlier interview. “Not everybody looks good in suits. But he’s got class.”
On Monday, Jesse described his grandfather as a kind and gentle man.
“I’ll give you an example. Once we were in a lift with lots of other people. He decided he wanted to take out his cigarettes and share them with everybody else. He felt everybody was his friend. He is really honest and simple.”
Ding said his elderly grandfather had struggled to fully comprehend the extent of his fame.
“[But] he is happy that people are being nice to him and to be welcomed by so many people. In fact, noise and excitement is what elderly people need the most. Having people pay attention to him and having a sense of existing are important to him,” he added. “I want my grandpa to feel that he is useful.”
Asked how he felt about becoming an internet celebrity, 85-year-old Ding was coy.
“I am not good at talking,” he said. “Is that OK?”"

The fresh inquest follows a two-decade battle by James’s parents to force Surrey police to hand over crucial evidence concerning her death, which was treated as suicide even though their daughter was said to be in good spirits, cheerful, happy and enjoying army life.
Deepcut recruit Cheryl James 'may have been raped before she died' Read more
Emma Norton, legal officer for human rights organisation Liberty, which has fought the case, said her parents were “finally getting an independent investigation into their daughter’s death. It has been recognised that questions they have been asking for 20 years are legitimate questions which are going to be examined, we hope, thoroughly and independently”.
James was one of four young recruits to die of gunshot wounds at Deepcut between 1995 and 2002. She was undergoing initial training as a recruit with the Royal Logistical Corps and died in November 1995 after being been posted alone, in battledress and armed with an SA80 rifle, to a gate at the barracks known as A2.
She was found at around 8.30am close to the gate in a small wooded area surrounded by trees with a single-entry bullet wound to the front of her head.
Surrey police almost immediately handed the investigation over to the Royal Military police special investigations branch. The original inquest, held three weeks after James’s death, lasted one hour and heard from seven witnesses. The coroner recorded an “open verdict” .
Liberty finally won a fresh inquest after threatening Surrey police with legal action under the Human Rights Act after the force consistently refused James’s parents, Desmond and Doreen, access to all their evidence in the case. The force then handed over more than 90 lever-arch files of forensic evidence, photographs, statements and other evidence.
A high court ruling in July 2014 said the original investigation by army police was “extremely limited and had flaws” and that there had been “an insufficiency of inquiry”.
The new inquest, by coroner Brian Barker QC, is expected to examine important material relating to ballistics, the finding of the body and the credibility of some witnesses as well as hearing from further witnesses. Pte James’s body was exhumed in August last year and bullet fragments recovered for a ballistics expert to analyse.
It will also examine whether there were shortcomings with barracks policies on sexual behaviour, supervision of young females, drugs, alcohol and accommodation. A pre-inquest hearing was told of material suggesting James “may have been sexually coerced or raped” shortly before her death.

James was the second of the four recruits found dead at Deepcut. Sean Benton, 20, died in June 1995, Geoff Gray, 17, in September 2001 and James Collinson, 17, in March 2002.
During the original and subsequent investigations by army police and Surrey police, an early assumption was made that James had taken her own life.
Norton said the fact it had taken 20 years for an independent investigation should be “extraordinary and shocking”. “But hang on, it is not extraordinary at all, because that is what happened to all four of the Deepcut deaths. It is apparently not extraordinary, and it should be, that these young people who died so long ago were not given the benefit of an independent investigation and their families were shut out and treated with contempt. It is shameful that we have had to wait 20 years for this,” she said.
Of James’s parents’ tenacity, she said: “I say to the army, this is what happens if you investigate yourself. You can’t just expect parents to accept that their luminous, beautiful, happy daughter would be found dead with a bullet wound to the face and for them just to be told: ‘Trust us, it’s suicide.’ Not being told why, or with any, or not a great deal, of evidence, why she might have committed suicide. But ‘Trust us. Get on with life.’ It’s extraordinary.”
In 2002, Surrey police reinvestigated the deaths, concluding there was no evidence of third-party involvement. That inquiry was criticised in a review by Devon and Cornwall police, which concluded key officers in the force adopted a particular “mindset” in favour of suicide as the most likely explanation, which influenced the approach to the investigation.
In 2006, a further review by Nicholas Blake QC, concluded the deaths were most likely self-inflicted, but expressed deep concern at the treatment of young recruits at Deepcut barracks.
Writing for the Guardian, James’s father said: “My family would not have seen this day without the Human Rights Act. It secured us access to vital evidence regarding Cheryl’s death – evidence it suited the authorities to withhold.” Without that evidence there would have been no new inquest, he said.
Liberty applied to the attorney general for a fresh inquest into James’s death in October 2013. The following March the attorney general granted his “fiat” – the process whereby a case can be referred to the high court for a hearing to determine whether a fresh inquest ought to be ordered. In July 2014, the high court ordered a new inquest.
Norton said the high court order was “a really important milestone” for the family. “For the first time they felt somebody with authority and with the necessary power was listening to them.
“They weren’t just grieving relatives that weren’t able to cope. They were actually asking very serious credible questions that were entitled to be answered.”"

Alan Yentob, the chair of trustees at the high-profile charity for 19 years, was criticised for his repeated denials that there had been historic failures in its financial management. This interpretation, MPs said, was “inaccurate and alarming”, highlighting his “continuing inability” to recognise the failures in his duties as chair of trustees.
The report by the public administration and constitutional affairs committee (Pacac) called for a radical change in charity regulation to prevent a repeat of the “extraordinary catalogue of failures of governance and control” that led to the collapse of Kids Company.
Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the committee, said they had heard “an extraordinary catalogue of failures of governance and control at every level: trustees, auditors, inspectors, regulators and government”.
MPs were damning about senior politicians from successive governments who handed out more than £42m of public money to Kids Company with no robust evidence it was making any positive difference. The Cabinet office minister, Oliver Letwin, was criticised for his role in ensuring the government gave millions of pounds of funding in the final months of the charity’s existence.
The report said the charity’s charismatic founder Camila Batmanghelidjh was allowed by trustees to be in total control of the organisation. In 2014 when Kids Company was £4m in debt and seeking £12m more of public money, Batmanghelidjh personally rejected a philanthropist’s offer of “unlimited funding” and a “large human resource”, MPs said.

The report said Batmanghelidjh told the donor she was turning down the financial help because the individual lacked “emotional authenticity” and was “not ready to be genuinely philanthropic”. Neither Yentob nor the rest of the trustees – none of whom had experience in youth work – were involved in the decision to turn down the financial lifeline, underlining “how unaccountable and dominant trustees had allowed her to become and how far she was able to insist on maintaining personal control”, the report said.
The former trustees of Kids Company issued a critical response to the report calling it “inaccurate, unbalanced and irresponsible” and said it was not based on a thorough investigation. They accused MPs on the committee of using parliamentary privilege to make allegations that would otherwise be subject to legal action.
In the report MPs were also damning about senior politicians from successive governments.
“Batmanghelidjh and Kids Company appeared to captivate some of the most senior political figures in the land, by the force of the chief executive’s personality as much as by the spin and profile she created for the charity,” the report said.
“As a consequence objective judgments about Kids Company were set aside ... There is little doubt that the high-profile support of successive prime ministers ... had an impact upon decision-making across Whitehall ... This included the authorisation of multiple grants outside of the normal competitive process.
“Ministers should not allow charity representatives to exploit their access to government in a way that may be unethical.”
The report challenged the comments of Batmanghelidgjh and Yentob, who said last week Kids Company had closed because of the malicious and untrue allegations about sexual and physical abuse within the charity that sparked a police investigation. The inquiry by police led to no evidence of criminality.
The MPs, however, said had trustees not allowed the weak financial position to persist for so long, Kids Company would not have been so vulnerable to the impact of the announcement of the police inquiry last summer.
Key findings in the report, published on Monday, included:
“Negligent trustees” repeatedly ignored auditors’ clear warnings about the precarious finances of the charity.
There was a clear link between the length of time the chair of trustees, Yentob, and Batmanghelidjh had been in power and the failure to correct serious weaknesses in the organisation.
It was not until 2015 – after £35m of public money had been given to the charity – that the government acknowledged the need for a robust examination of its activities and outcomes.
The government knew Kids Company was overstating the number of clients it worked with but did nothing about it.
Earlier intervention by the Charity Commission might have helped safeguard Kids Company, which provided valuable support to many vulnerable young people.
Bernard Jenkin, chair of the committee, said: “The committee has heard many positive accounts of the valuable work Kids Company did with some very vulnerable clients, and of employees who were inspired and motivated ... this makes the board’s failure to ensure the charity’s sustainability all the more tragic. There has been a litany of allegations of inappropriate ‘therapies’, lavish spending and abuse of power – we hope this episode highlights to all trustees that protecting the reputation of an organisation is a core element of good governance.”
MPs described the “unique, privileged and significant access” to senior ministers and prime ministers of successive governments enjoyed by Kids Company – which angered other charities doing similar work – and also meant it was almost untouchable.
It was a “matter of considerable concern”, the report said, how individuals with concerns about the charity remained silent because of its powerful connections.
Yentob’s role as a senior executive in the BBC at the time of huge media interest in the charity of which he was chair of trustees was also examined.
He has admitted he stood behind the glass with the producer during a BBC interview with Batmanghelidjh, and made a phonecall to another BBC journalist who was due to make a broadcast about the charity’s difficulties, something which the report said was “unwise at best and deliberately intimidating at worst”.
Noting Yentob had since resigned his main position at the corporation, but still retained substantial responsibilities and oversaw substantial budgets, MPs were critical of the way the BBC has handled the affair.

“The proper governance of conflicts of interests and standards of behaviour – particularly among its senior executives – is a very senior matter for any reputable organisation. That a senior figure could act in this way and it could take so long for action to be taken reflects poorly on BBC leadership,” the report said.
The report was dismissed by Batmanghelidjh, who told the Guardian that the inquiry had been superficial: “I can only have respect for reports that are based on as rigorous examination of the facts. I’m grateful the police did that [in their investigation into allegations of abuse at Kids Company] and we were cleared. I’m sorry that the Pacac MPs didn’t.”
In a statement, the former trustees of Kids Company said: “For the committee to conclude that the trustees, auditors, care experts, inspectors, regulators and the government all failed ‘at every level’ is astonishing.
“Instead of basing its findings on a thorough investigation of the evidence, the committee has naively accepted allegations made in the media and by a small number of individuals, some with vested interests in damaging Kids Company and its much-praised model of loving care and practical support.
“Practically no weight has been given to the evidence presented to the committee by numerous witnesses who were closer to the work of the charity.”
Although the report suggests the charity had poor child protection practices, the trustees note that the Metropolitan police – which last Thursday dismissed 32 claims against Kids Company of sexual and physical abuse after a six-month inquiry – found no evidence of safeguarding failings."
NFL|New England Patriots|US sports|Tom Brady,2016-02-01T18:12:38,guardian,Guardian Sport,Former New England Patriots tight end serving life sentence for murder says he watches every game from prison but has no love for team’s owner Robert Kraft,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/01/aaron-hernandez-says-he-still-roots-for-new-england-patriots-from-prison,Aaron Hernandez says he still roots for New England Patriots from prison,en,sport|US sports,,"A life sentence in prison has not dampened Aaron Hernandez’s support of the New England Patriots – nor his anger toward the team’s owner.
The former star tight end, who rose to fame in three productive seasons with the Patriots but in April was found guilty of first-degree murder in the killing of his friend Odin Lloyd, wrote in a jailhouse letter obtained by TMZ that he watches “every game faithfully” and roots for the former team-mates he still regards as friends, namely Tom Brady, Julian Edelman, Deion Branch and Rob Gronkowski.
“I actually could watch TV and the games; I have a TV in my cell!,” he wrote in the letter dated 10 December to a woman known only as Rachel. “And yes I still root for my squad and still love all the ones I loved. The closest I was with was probably [Tom] Brady [and] whom I love to death and always will and only hope the best for them. But was cool with Julez [Edelman], [Deion] Branch (I fucked with and got mad love for) and ‘the BEST TE ever to walk on a football field’ GRONK!”

But the 26-year-old, sentenced to life without parole at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Massachusetts, spared no criticism of Patriots owner Robert Kraft, one of the 131 witnesses called by the prosecution during the trial.
“Fake ass non loyal Kraft who told me he loved me everytime he seen me but obviously shows his word ain’t shit but my love was real and still love all of them cuz I’m not a phony like many of them!” he wrote.
Hernandez’s conviction was a spectacular fall from grace for a player who had a $40m contract with the Patriots but was cut by the team within hours of his arrest.
The former University of Florida star was also found guilty on each of five weapons charges: one count of carrying a firearm without a license, two counts of carrying a large capacity firearm, one count of possession of a firearm without a firearm identification card, and one count of possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card.
Hernandez was one of the best tight ends in the NFL at the time of the murder. He entered the league in 2010, and in his second game became the youngest player in 50 years to have 100 receiving yards in a game.
He was Brady’s top target in a narrow Super Bowl XLVI loss to the New York Giants, catching a team-high eight passes for 67 yards and a touchdown.
In 38 games, he had 175 catches for a total of 1,956 yards but the number would have been much higher if it had not been for series of injuries."

And the two teams have exchanged admiring glances
Their bandwagon has beer. Charlotte gets the swag and the bromance, but Leicester City’s true Carolina hearts actually rest two hours north and west of Bank of America Stadium, nestled in a mountain range.
If ever an official mid-south Foxes supporters group were to see the light of day, the odds are good it would probably spring from Asheville, North Carolina, dubbed “Beer City USA” four years in a row, a soccer-friendly burg of 83,000-plus that’s home to more than a dozen craft breweries. A burg where Chris Watts has been preaching the gospel of blue for more than 15 years now.
CBS and NBC agree $450m deal for expanded Thursday Night Football coverage Read more
“It’s like a dream,” says Watts, a Leicestershire native who has called Asheville home since moving to the States almost two decades ago. “My brother’s a season-ticket holder and he gets to the games. I was over there in October, against Crystal Palace and Watford, and it was just unbelievable to see where we were. And you keep thinking, ‘Is this going to keep going?’ It’s a bit like a dream. At the same time, it’s brilliant.”
Pinch him, he giggles. And why the hell not? Watts has been a Carolina Panthers fan for more than 10 years and a Foxes fan for pretty much the last five decades, through thick, thin, and thinner. Some eight years earlier, he had shepherded a group of US friends back to Leicestershire for his 50th birthday and a series of matches in the Midlands, including a pair at the King Power, then the Walkers Stadium.
“Five minutes into the [match],” one of those friends, Tim Branson, recalls of his initial Foxes experience, “I saw four guys carrying out two.”
But he was hooked.
The second game, they got the skybox treatment. Watts landed a program signed by the team — which, as it turned out, would become the first Foxes side ever to be relegated from the Championship to the third tier of the English football pyramid.
“I’ve still got it,” Watts chuckles. “I’ve got a signed program, in a frame, of Leicester at their lowest.”
And look who’s laughing now.
The Panthers prepping for the biggest single event in North American sport, Super Bowl 50’s NFC gatecrashers. The Foxes are atop the most popular soccer league on the planet. First, they were cute. Then a curiosity. Then a fluke. Then a stubborn anamoly. They weren’t supposed to here, either of them.
The parallels are valid and real enough: they’d finished their previous seasons on an unexpected, almost desperate hot streak. They’d been dismissed by the experts, were under-appreciated outside their own province, middling brand names turning in gold-caliber performances, week after week, month upon month. Leicester City looked at the Carolina Panthers, 3,924 miles and an ocean away, and saw — well, themselves.
“The beginning of the year, [Leicester City] didn’t have great expectations … and kind of the same goes for us,” says Panthers kicker Graham Gano, one of four Carolina players to receive customized Leicester City shirts from the surprise Premier League leaders last month. “They’ve done really well this year, and so have we. So they kind of thought their season was similar to ours and they pulled for us and that’s how we got the jerseys.”
Before their NFC Divisional Round test against Seattle on 17 January, Panthers players turned up at work to find that the Foxes had sent over customized blue shirts for quarterback Cam Newton, cornerback Josh Norman, linebacker Luke Kuechly and Gano.
“Carolina have had an incredible season,” the Leicester left-back Christian Fuchs told the team’s official website. “Like us, they ended last season really well and again, like us, some people didn’t expect them to do what they’ve done this season, even after the great start they had.”
Before long, they shared a narrative and a hashtag: #KeepPounding. The Panthers returned the favor, and Leicester shared pictures and videos on social media of striker Jamie Vardy, centre-back Wes Morgan, Fuchs and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel decked out in Carolina black, tossing and kicking an NFL football around.
“They were natural at it,” Gano says. “It would be interesting to see them kicking field goals and what it would look like. Obviously, their form looks good, but I never saw the ball going through the uprights. It’s a little different swing than [it takes] to keep the ball under the posts. But I’d love to have an opportunity sometime to have a kick around with some of the pros over [there], and compare how I match up with those guys.”
But he thinks they’d probably be thick as thieves, especially after the Foxes posted a video to YouTube of Fuchs attempting a series of “keepy-uppis” with the oblong American football.
“I was in the airport in Chicago and I’m sitting at the bar and got talking about football – American and English,” Watts recalls. “And I pulled up [the Fuchs video] to show a few others. It’s pretty neat to see an English soccer player, albeit an Austrian, keeping up an American football. They thought it was pretty cool.”
In one corner, the Panthers, unloved, slapped with 22-to-1 odds to win the NFC back in May and 40-1 to win the whole shebang. In the other, Leicester, dismissed almost universal preseason favorites to be relegated this term, 2000-1 odds to win the league at the start of the campaign.
“It’s not quite the same,” Watts says of the two franchises and their comparative roads. “But nobody was expecting the Panthers to be where they are. A lot of my friends, when they saw the stuff about the shirts [coming over], and then the Panthers sent shirts back the other way, it’s been neat.”
Carolina are playing in their first Super Bowl in 12 years; since 2003-04, 13 different NFL teams have qualified for the title game. Leicester are the first squad other than one of the “Big Five” clubs [Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea] to be leading the Premier League in the last week of January since Newcastle in 1995-96.
“Being on both sides, [the more remarkable story is] Leicester City, for me, just because of what they’ve had to do, the fight, where they’ve had to come from,” says Branson. “Going down to the third division and going back into the second and having to fight their way back to the top. Asheville’s got a single-A [baseball] club. It would be like them somehow winning and if they did promotions, getting promoted to the majors. In a little city like Asheville, it doesn’t happen very often.”
“You’ve got to have respect for them,” Gano says of the Foxes’ rise. “I haven’t been able to catch a ton of their games – we’ve been pretty busy over here, so I haven’t really had the opportunity to catch up with them.”
And, full disclosure, Gano is a Bayern Munich fan, having grown up bouncing from Scotland to Germany to Scotland to Canada as a Navy brat (“I used to have a thick accent,” he notes, without a trace of burr.) Born in Scotland, he also maintains a bit of a soft spot for Rangers.
“But I didn’t have a favorite English team,” the kicker says. “So I guess I can pull for [Leicester] now.”
After all, there’s plenty of room on the wagon. And in Asheville, the best beer on the continent never tasted better."

A source told AP the deals are worth $450m for 10 games, five each on CBS and NBC. CBS paid $300m for eight games in 2015. The new contracts for 2016 and 2017 increase the number of games on traditional broadcast TV by two. They will again be simulcast on NFL Network.
“Our mission when we first put games on Thursday nights in 2006 was to work strategically to make Thursdays a night for NFL football in the mold of what Monday and Sunday nights mean to millions of fans across the country,” said Robert Kraft, chairman of the NFL’s broadcast committee. “We’ve made great strides since that point, and growing the base of games with CBS, now with NBC, and soon with digital streaming will only help us solidify this night in the consciousness of NFL fans here and globally.”
NFL Network will still televise eight games exclusively, which will include late-season Saturday match-ups and other to-be-determined games. The league is also negotiating with digital companies for a separate streaming rights deal, which will be announced soon.
The NFL launched Thursday Night Football on the NFL Network in 2006 with eight games, a number that grew to 13 by 2012. In 2014, the league partnered with CBS for a 16-game slate — half simulcast on CBS and NFL Network and half solely on NFL Network.
CBS will broadcast the first half of the season and NBC the second. Both networks will use their top broadcasting teams and contribute to the production of the NFL Network-only games."

A Taliban suicide bomber has blown himself up after joining a queue to enter a police office in Kabul, killing 20 people and wounding at least 29 in the worst such attack this year.
Monday’s attack near the headquarters of the paramilitary Afghan National Civil Order Police was claimed by the militant group, which, despite a renewed push to restart formal peace talks, is mounting an unprecedented winter offensive.
Najib Danish, an interior ministry spokesman, told AFP there was “a suicide car bomb in the vicinity of a police base in Kabul city”.
An AFP photographer said he saw at least 10 bodies around the base. Ambulances rushed to the scene, which was cordoned off by authorities. The interior ministry later said in a statement that the attack had claimed the lives of 20 people and wounded nearly 30 others, Reuters reported.
Why it is time to act fast on the rise of the suicide bomber Read more
The attack came before a third round of four-country “roadmap talks” trying to lay the groundwork for direct dialogue between Kabul and the Taliban.
Delegates from Afghanistan, Pakistan, China and the US are set to convene in Islamabad on 6 February in an effort to seek a negotiated end to the 14-year Taliban insurgency.
The Taliban have stepped up attacks on government and foreign targets in Afghanistan this winter, when fighting usually abates, underscoring a worsening security situation.
Observers say the intensifying insurgency highlights a push by the militants to seize more territory in an attempt to wrangle greater concessions during talks.
The city was hit by a series of suicide attacks last month, including one that killed seven journalists from a private television station as the Taliban stepped up their campaign against the western-backed government.
The attacks coincided with renewed efforts to revive a peace process with the Islamist insurgent movement that stalled last year.
The Afghan National Civil Order police was set up as a gendarmerie-style paramilitary unit to control riots and urban disorder but have also been used in counter-insurgency roles against the Taliban."

The leader of an influential Pakistani political party who was arrested in London on suspicion of money laundering has been released from bail.
Altaf Hussain, leader and founder of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), was arrested on 3 June 2014 after officers searched a residential address in the north-west of the British capital.
The 61-year-old, who has lived in and led the party from the UK since 1991, said he was “relieved” that the Metropolitan police had advised him his bail had been cancelled.
He added: “I continue to deny any involvement in money laundering and would like to thank my millions of members and followers around the world for their ongoing support.”
Five other men arrested in connection with the same money-laundering investigation also received the same news.
A Met spokesman said: “Releasing of these six people from bail does not mean that no further action will be taken against them. No decision has yet been made, but it does mean that they will no longer be required to return to a police station on a date imposed by the investigators.”
He added that police had retained cash seized as part of the investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, pending further inquiries.
MQM, which controls Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, mainly represents the Urdu-speaking Muhajir community, descendants of immigrants from other parts of south Asia who settled in Pakistan following independence in 1947.
It has had a block of about 20 members in the country’s national assembly for years.
In September 2010, a prominent MQM member, Imran Farooq, was stabbed to death outside his home in Edgware, north London, when he was ambushed on his way home from work."

Jenkin said Kids Company had become too politicised and ministers “should not have been anywhere near the decision” to prop the charity up with public money.
“Two ministers, Oliver Letwin and one other, actually overrode the advice of the civil service to hand over £3m and the charity went bust the next day,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“It is for them to explain to the public accounts committee why that happened. One of the lessons of this is where a charity becomes politicised, where the figure representing the charity becomes a device used in political arguments … where ministers clearly have a conflict, they shouldn’t be involved in these decisions.”
Jenkin also linked the charity’s governance failings to the role of its founder, Camila Batmanghelidjh, who he claimed was a “very very
powerful personality and she became expert at controlling the people around her”.
He said the trustees of Kids Company “were in her thrall” and accused her of preventing information reaching them.
Alan Yentob, the chair of trustees at the high-profile charity for 19 years, was criticised in a report into the charity’s collapse by Jenkin’s committee for his repeated denials that there had been historic failures in its financial management. This interpretation, MPs said, was “inaccurate and alarming”, highlighting his “continuing inability” to recognise the failures in his duties as chair of trustees.
The report by the public administration and constitutional affairs committee (Pacac) called for a radical change in charity regulation to prevent a repeat of the “extraordinary catalogue of failures of governance and control” that led to the collapse of Kids Company.

Jenkin said his committee had heard “an extraordinary catalogue of failures of governance and control at every level: trustees, auditors, inspectors, regulators and government”.
MPs were damning about senior politicians from successive governments who handed out more than £42m of public money to the charity with no robust evidence it was making any positive difference. Letwin, the Cabinet Office minister, was criticised for his role in ensuring the government gave millions of pounds of funding in the final months of the charity’s existence.

The report Batmanghelidjh was allowed by trustees to be in total control of the organisation. In 2014 when Kids Company was £4m in debt and seeking £12m more of public money, Batmanghelidjh personally rejected a philanthropist’s offer of “unlimited funding” and a “large human resource”, MPs said.
The report said Batmanghelidjh told the donor she was turning down the financial help because the individual lacked “emotional authenticity” and was “not ready to be genuinely philanthropic”.
Neither Yentob nor the rest of the trustees – none of whom had experience in youth work – were involved in the decision to turn down the financial lifeline, underlining “how unaccountable and dominant trustees had allowed her to become and how far she was able to insist on maintaining personal control”, the report said.
The former trustees of Kids Company issued a critical response to the report calling it “inaccurate, unbalanced and irresponsible” and said it was not based on a thorough investigation. They accused MPs on the committee of using parliamentary privilege to make allegations that would otherwise be subject to legal action.

UK news|Dave Hill on London|Jeremy Corbyn|Zac Goldsmith|Mayoral elections|Local politics|Local government|blogposts,2016-02-01T10:53:30,guardian,Dave Hill,A Labour win in the capital’s mayoral race would give comfort to the party’s leader but also serve as a telling rebuke,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/feb/01/a-sadiq-khan-win-in-london-would-expose-the-failings-of-jeremy-corbyn,A Sadiq Khan win in London would expose the failings of Jeremy Corbyn,en,UK,,"Don’t stop me if you’ve heard all this before. My story has a novelty ending. Sitting comfortably?
Jeremy Corbyn, you will have read, is leading the Labour Party to a string of election defeats, beginning with a bunch of them in May. Labour will lose in Scotland, lose in Wales and lose in most of England too. The one potential light on this gloomy near horizon is the contest for the London mayoralty. Most available evidence suggests that Labour’s Sadiq Khan is on course for victory. It is widely held that a Khan triumph in the capital would give Corbyn’s hapless leadership a bit of breathing space; a metropolitan version of the air pocket Jim McMahon kindly supplied by winning Oldham West back in December.
All of the above is probably true. But here’s where my story deviates from the standard script. The election of a Mayor Khan would give Corbyn something to cheer about, but his party something sobering to reflect on too. It would send a larger message about the state of Labour, one that would be heard far beyond the boundaries of the capital. That message would say that a Labour politician who is savvy, practical and paints a persuasive picture of beneficial change can win power from a left-of-centre platform no matter what muck Conservatives throw at him. Corbyn would not find comparisons flattering.
Last week, the first major hustings of the mayoral campaign was held at the London School of Economics, hosted by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The candidates of the capital’s five leading parties displayed their charms to a packed house. The three outsiders - Sian Berry for the Greens, Caroline Pidgeon of the Lib Dems and Ukip’s Peter Whittle - will all have made new friends, but the next mayor is almost certain to be Khan or the Tory Zac Goldsmith.
The debate was not decisive - a low-scoring draw, or perhaps a narrow Khan win- but it was instructive. Goldsmith, slender, tall and with the manner of an earnest yet diffident royal, is being sold as both a Richmond Park free spirit and a fellow his party leaders in government can do business with. Londoners’ top concern is housing, specifically the soaring price of it. Goldsmith wants a big push to redevelop public brownfield land, including what he has called “ugly” estates. He linked house-building to transport policy, correctly arguing that where a new rail line goes, investment in new homes tends to follow. Where would Khan’s proposed four-year fares freeze leave that and the finances of Transport for London (TfL), he asked?
It was pleasant to hear him expounding policy, albeit largely thanks to the contrast this made with the “red scare” strategy his Crosbyite campaign team is conducting in an attempt to depress the Labour vote and frighten indifferent Tory sympathisers and floating voters into backing their boy. For months their propaganda has yoked Khan’s name to Corbyn’s, making much of the fact that Khan nominated him to join the Labour leadership contest but not, of course, mentioning that Khan, like around half of the 35 Labour MPs who helped Corbyn in the same way, didn’t actually vote for him.
David Cameron, a man now routinely resembling a golf club members’ lounge boor, has lately joined in with this dismal exercise by claiming that Khan would use Londoners as “lab rats” in some dastardly Corbynite experiment. Both he and Goldsmith know perfectly well that Khan, unlike Corbyn, is a mainstream “soft Left” Labour politician, that mayoral powers are too narrow for dry running full-scale national regimes and that, in any case, Corbyn looks as likely to become prime minister as Donald Trump does to convert to Islam. There are more dignified ways to make a living than spending mountains of money peddling cheap insinuation, but I suppose there might be a knighthood in it.
I still can’t quite believe that Goldsmith’s soul sits well with all this stuff. Dig out back issues of The Ecologist magazine, which he edited for six years from early 2000, and make acquaintance with an inquiring, passionate, dedicated world-saver, calling for the cancellation of poor nations’ debts, denouncing Blairite collusion with global corporations and giving Tony Benn space to lament the decline of democracy. Given his wealth, localist fancies, long-term Euroscepticism and green welly concerns, joining the Tories was always a likely route to accommodation with the political establishment. But now Goldsmith finds himself speaking up for more armed police and touting the opaque concessions he says he’s salvaged from the Housing Bill. At the hustings he was at his most convincing when railing against HGVs and poisonous fumes. Being hitched to the Tories diminishes him in this setting. He’d bring more grace and quality to the mayoral contest if he ran as an independent.
Khan, by contrast, was buzzy, judiciously pugnacious and adept at jab and move. “Scratched record,” groaned someone sitting behind me when he informed his umpteenth audience that he grew up in a council house in Tooting. Yet the contrast this makes with the privileged Goldsmith seems to be helping him. Khan’s choppy speaking style doesn’t always serve him well, but he makes a few jokes, which do. He’s not averse to playing the populist, such as by feeding the common prejudice that London’s shortage of homes most Londoners can afford would magically end if only rich foreigners were stopped from buying expensive ones. It won him a big round of applause.
He’s been building bridges and defences too, reaching out audaciously to London’s business interests and pledging solidarity with all communities: Square Mile grandees and the Jewish Chronicle are among those to declare themselves impressed. After Cameron suggested that Khan, a Muslim, would be weak against “Islamist extremists”, the Labour candidate has accused the government of leaving the capital “vulnerable” by its “failure” on the issue.
On Sunday, he faced stiff questioning from BBC London’s political editor Tim Donovan (watch from 40 minute point), who pressed him on his fares freeze pledge and on housing policy, asking Khan to explain, among other things, how his proposed “50% rule” to increase the amount of below market-priced homes in housing developments could possibly work. Khan would not be moved: his fares policy was “fully costed” he said, brushing aside a TfL briefing document contending that it is not; a 50% “affordable” housing yield was being achieved in some parts of London.
They may or may not impress you, but this Labour politician has his battle lines worked out: Londoners will pay no more to catch a bus or Tube in 2020 than they do now if I am mayor; I will be the “most business-friendly mayor ever”; London will be “a living wage city”; unlike Goldsmith, I have “the vision, the values and the experience”; I will be “a mayor for all Londoners.” It has been argued, persuasively, that neither Khan nor Goldsmith has yet created a really clear or exciting sense of how they’d want London to change. But there is still time for that, and the outline of a Khan story for capital is starting to be written: dynamic yet inclusive, prosperous yet affordable, competitive yet fair. Meanwhile, where the nation is concerned, Corbyn has yet to find his Biro.
Much could yet change in the race for City Hall and even though London’s electoral demographics look favourable, it is far from guaranteed that Khan will win. But if he does it will not only give Corbyn a measure of comfort. It will also serve as a sharp rebuke."

A British mother who took her young son to Syria is beginning a six-year jail sentence after a judge concluded she had “embraced” Islamic State and was prepared to let her child become an Isis fighter.
Tareena Shakil, 26, claimed she had been groomed by members of Isis and escaped back to the UK after realising she had made a terrible mistake by travelling to its stronghold in Raqqa.
Sentencing her at Birmingham crown court, the judge Melbourne Inman made it clear he held reservations about her version of events. “You told lie after lie to the police and in court,” he said.
The judge, the recorder of Birmingham, was particularly critical of Shakil’s decision to take her child to Syria and allow him to be photographed in clothing bearing an Isis logo and with an assault rifle.

“Most alarming is the fact that you took your son and how he was used,” he said. “ The most abhorrent photographs were those taken of your son wearing a balaclava with an Isis logo and specifically the photograph of your son, no more than a toddler, standing next to an AK47 under a title which, translated from the Arabic, means ‘Father of the British jihad’.”
The judge added: “You were well aware that the future which you had subjected your son to was very likely to be indoctrination and thereafter life as a terrorist fighter.”

Jailing her for four years for her Isis membership and two years for encouraging acts of terror in messages she sent via social media, the judge said she would be entitled to release on licence after the halfway point.
An order of the court made under section 47 of the Counter Terrorism Act means that, as a convicted terrorist, Shakil must notify police of her personal details including her home address for 15 years after her release.
Shakil was radicalised on the internet and travelled to Syria via Turkey in October 2014 after telling friends and family she was off on a beach holiday. She spent more than two months living in a mansion with women of various nationalities waiting to be matched up with fighters, and while there sent messages and pictures glorifying Isis.
Shakil left Syria in January 2015 and arrived back in the UK the following month. She initially told police she had been kidnapped. In the witness box she gave an extraordinary account of her time in Raqqa and claimed she managed to escape after becoming disillusioned and frightened, running across the border with her young son.
Shakil said she had been groomed by Isis recruiters who had targeted her when she was low because of the breakup of her marriage in the UK. She said her every move had been monitored by Isis minders and she had no choice but to send the messages and pictures supportive of the group.
Following her conviction, her father, Mohammed Shakil, claimed she would appeal against her conviction. He told ITV News: “It was a mistake ... [She is] the perfect daughter, the daughter who never went out nightclubbing and never went out doing this or going there, who kept herself busy in studies, and who wanted to be somebody in life and have an important role. That’s who she wanted to be: a somebody, not a nobody.”
The judge said it may never be known what happened in Raqqa, but he believed that Shakil had been prepared to become the bride of an Isis fighter. He dismissed her claim that before she went to Syria she had not known of the atrocities Isis has committed.
“You told lie after lie to the police and in court … including that you were kidnapped, were not responsible for any tweets and any incriminating photographs were staged against your will,” he said.
The judge told Shakil it was clear she had been radicalised following online conversations with prominent members of the terrorist group. He mentioned by name a man called Fabio Pocas, who is believed to be an Isis member of Portuguese descent.
“You embraced Isis, you sent messages on the day of your arrival in Syria that you were not coming back and by 28 October you were sending a message to your brother-in-law that it was part of your faith to kill the murtadeen [apostates] and on 9 December you told your father you wanted to die a martyr.”
Shakil had also encouraged other women to join her in Raqqa. The judge said: “Your role as a woman in Isis was different to that of a man but you embraced it and were willing to support those in Raqqa, and potentially those outside, to come and play their role in providing fighters of the future and were willing, shamelessly, to allow your son to be photographed in terms that could only be taken as a fighter of the future.”
However, the judge did accept that Shakil had returned after having a “change of heart” – which he said was in her favour.
Shakil, who is from Burton-upon-Trent but was living in Birmingham before she left for Syria, was one of about 60 British women believed to have left to join Isis in Syria. They were said to have been among 600 women from Europe, North America and Australia in Syria."

Police have refused to release the confidential report of an investigation into allegations that they improperly destroyed documents compiled on a Green party peer.
The allegations have been made by a police whistleblower who said officers destroyed documents recording the political activities of Jenny Jones to prevent her from obtaining them, in what he called a “highly irregular” cover-up.
Sgt David Williams wrote to Lady Jones outlining the allegations, in a letter that was disclosed in the Guardian in January. The peer asked the Metropolitan police to give her a copy of a report on the outcome of the investigation.
The force, which denies the allegations, said it was under no obligation to release the report to her. The force said reports from its directorate of professional standards (DPS) were not routinely disclosed to complainants or outsiders.
Officer claims Met police improperly destroyed files on Green party peer Read more
“The reason for this is that the investigator must be in a position to cover all issues openly and comprehensively in their report. Such reports often include sensitive operational or personal information which, if disclosed could jeopardise future investigation techniques or compromise operational security and the safety and privacy of individuals involved in the investigation.”
Jones said: ”Publishing the report would be like cleaning a wound to allow it to heal. I’m not giving up until I know exactly what happened.”
The Green party peer is also the deputy chair of the official committee that scrutinises the Metropolitan police, and served on the Metropolitan Police Authority for many years.
Williams, a serving Metropolitan police officer who has worked for five years in the clandestine “domestic extremism” unit that keeps track of protesters, disclosed details of the alleged incident in a personal four-page letter to Jones.
He said he had written the letter as a last resort as he had exhausted the police’s internal avenues for raising wrongdoing. His allegations had been investigated by its internal directorate charged with looking at alleged misconduct. Williams has said he does not believe that his allegations were investigated properly.
The DPS started an investigation after Williams alleged that in June 2014 he witnessed five officers shredding or deleting police records that he believed related to Jones. He told her that this behaviour caused him great concern “as I believed this was a cover-up to ensure you could not get any access to police records relating to you through a freedom of information request”.
He added that he feared that blowing the whistle may lead to a “series of escalating actions against me designed to discredit me or lead to my suspension from duty or my dismissal”.

The Green party peer knew nothing about the allegations until Williams blew the whistle. After she demanded an explanation, Craig Mackey, the Met’s deputy commissioner, told her there was evidence that documents had been destroyed on the day alleged by Williams, but the Met could not establish that they related to her.
Mackey said that following concerns that the “domestic extremism” unit was holding too much data, it had been encouraged “to remove data which is either too old, inappropriate or irrelevant on a regular basis”.
He said: “The regular removal of data from the database is encouraged, and in line with policy.”
The unit maintains a database recording the political activities of thousands of political activists, and has been accused of overstepping the mark and collecting information about campaigners who have engaged in peaceful protest.
The final report of the investigation was sent last year to senior Met officers. The Met said details of witnesses and their accounts formed part of investigation reports and were “provided under a legitimate expectation of confidentiality and we have a duty to respect this”."

The RMT union has confirmed plans for a 48-hour strike on the London Underground over job cuts and ticket office closures.
TfL spends £600,000 advertising night tube – despite it having no launch date Read more
The walkout by thousands of station staff, starting at 9pm on Saturday, would severely impact tube services on Sunday and Monday. A threatened series of strikes over the introduction of the night tube, which were to be joined by drivers and other unions, has been called off, but the RMT is set to go ahead in this parallel dispute.
The union has called seven days of action, including an overtime ban. However, talks are expected later in the week between the RMT and Transport for London, which may yet avert the strike.
The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, attacked his putative Labour successor, Sadiq Khan, for failing to denounce the RMT. Johnson branded the strike “insane”, adding that ticket offices would not be re-opened.
He said: “The strike promises to be nothing more than a pointless inconvenience … Why won’t [Khan] just say unequivocally, loud and clear, that the RMT leadership is wrong to put its members through this madness – not to mention the travelling public?”
The RMT has said the job losses are being driven by budget cuts, and safety on the tube will be jeopardised by the move."

Guida Rufino, 38, was found with fatal neck injuries when police were called to reports of a domestic incident at her house in Idle on Sunday evening. Officers also found her partner, Tony Roberts, 37, with serious injuries to his leg. Both were pronounced dead at the scene and two knives were recovered from the property.
It is understood that detectives believe the incident was a murder-suicide and are not looking for anyone else. Forensics officers were seen entering the property on Monday morning.
Rufino, originally from Portugal, was a company director at Leeds Occupational Health, which provides medical advice and clinical support across the north-east of England. Roberts is believed to have been a cousin of the snooker star Paul Hunter, who died from cancer in 2006 aged 27.
The couple’s two-year-old daughter attended the nearby Wesley House private day nursery. Hayley Wright, the manager of the nursery, told the Telegraph & Argus that she had called the parents’ mobile phones on Monday morning after news of the incident broke.
“There was no answer,” she said. “I cried and was in shock. I still do not believe it. Mum said on Thursday: ‘I cannot wait for my daughter to start talking and to say I love you mummy.’”
She said staff were “really upset” and had not noticed anything untoward about the couple.
Rufino’s business partner Dr Jacqueline Senior said the 38-year-old was a devoted mother. “Guida and I had worked together for many years. We first met when we worked at Interact Health here in Leeds in 2002. That company went into administration in January 2005, we saw the opportunity to start our own company and Leeds Occupational Health Limited started trading on April 1, 2015.
“She always wanted a child and gave birth to a beautiful daughter in 2013 to whom she was devoted. She returned from maternity leave invigorated and inspired to grow our business and we both looked forward to an exciting 2016.
“We are all devastated. Dr Paul Davies, my other business partner, and all our employees send sincere condolences to her family.”
Dominic Fear, a councillor for Idle and Thackley, said the incident would shock the close-knit community where the couple lived.
He said: “It’s very shocking but we need to wait and see what the outcome of the police inquiry is,. It’s a family area, it’s not the kind of place where you can not know your neighbours, and it’s near a park, and with their little one, people will know them and it will really affect people that know them.”
West Yorkshire police appealed for anyone who heard or saw anything suspicious around the property at 6pm on Sunday to come forward.
Anyone with information is asked to call the homicide and major inquiries team on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

A mechanic has been jailed for a minimum of 27 years for raping and strangling a trainee lawyer in an act of “unspeakable wickedness”.
Peter Kibisu, 24, attacked Elizabeth Nnyanzi, 31, in her bedroom after a night out. He then tried to cover his tracks by reporting her death on 14 August last year after a full day’s work at a BMW dealership.
It was only after his story about an intruder at the family home in Harrow, north-west London, unravelled that Kibisu admitted his crimes.
The tearful family of Nnyanzi gathered at the Old Bailey, where Kibisu was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 27 years. The judge Richard Marks QC said: “She was a quite outstanding young woman of immense talent and ability with a life of huge potential ahead of her. She was variously described as caring, tenacious, hard working, beautiful and graceful.”
He told Kibisu: “What you did that morning was truly shocking. Your actions were those of unspeakable wickedness and it is frankly hard to comprehend how you could have done that to anybody, still less a young woman like her.”
Mark Heywood QC, proseucting, said the defendant had been living with the Nnyanzi family for about nine months, during which time Nnyanzi regarded him as a much younger “cousin”.
At the time of the killing, her family members were all away and she was alone in the house with Kibisu. Heywood said: “The defendant returned home to where he was living with very close family friends having been out for almost the entire night.
“He was very probably affected by drink and in the very short time before he then left once more – no more than one and a half hours – he took very grave advantage of those who had given him a home by first sexually attacking and then killing Elizabeth Nnyanzi, one of the daughters of the house who was then in the property in her bedroom.”
He tried to cover his tracks by sending a text message to the victim en route to work saying: “Sorry I had to leave. I think you were in the shower at the time.”
At about 6pm that night, Kibisu dialled 999 to report that he had come home from work and found Nnyanzi not breathing. On arrival, officers found her lying dead in her bedroom wearing a jumper dress and underwear that had been put on inside out.
The patio door was ajar and tool marks suggested an intruder, while Kibisu appeared to be in “extreme distress, crying and sobbing”, the prosecutor said.
Officers found he had noticeable marks on his face, neck and arms which he put down to work-related injuries and his barber.
Kibisu went on to break the news of Nnyanzi’s death to her sister Cressida, who then contacted other family members.
He was initially interviewed as a significant witness but was arrested within days for the murder, the court heard.
A pair or bloodied boxer shorts belonging to the defendant were found in a bin and Kibisu’s DNA was found under the victim’s broken fingernails, showing how she had tried to fight him off during the attack.
One neighbour told police he heard high-pitched noises coming from an upstairs room of the house on the morning of Nnyanzi’s death. They were at first “shocked” and then seemed in “panic or fear”, with the phrase “oh my God” being used repeatedly."

Two police officers face possible criminal charges over the death of a young man with mental health problems who suffered cardiac arrest while in custody.
James Herbert, 25, died after being left naked on the floor of a police cell in Somerset, prompting an inquest jury to raise serious concerns about his treatment at the hands of officers.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission has investigated and has passed on a file on the actions of two officers to the Crown Prosecution Service. It will be up to CPS lawyers to consider if either or both of the pair should be charged and brought before a court.
In addition, the IPCC has also asked prosecutors to consider if the Avon and Somerset force should be charged over potential health and safety offences.
Herbert, a data-recovery engineer, was detained under the Mental Health Act after being seen acting strangely in a street in Wells, Somerset, in the summer of 2010.
He was restrained by police and placed in the back of patrol van and driven almost 30 miles to Yeovil police station before being carried on a blanket into a cell.
In 2013, the inquest jury that heard the case at Wells town hall concluded that Herbert died of cardiac arrest after taking a “legal high”.
But it also highlighted factors that may have contributed to his death including a lack of communication between police officers about the man’s mental health, his drug use and previous incidents, the failure to call for medical assistance while he was being taken to the police station, and the need for closer monitoring of him.
The IPCC had already looked at the circumstances but following the inquest it launched a second inquiry into the matter.
On Monday a spokesman said: “The IPCC has completed its second investigation into the circumstances of James Herbert’s death and referred two Avon and Somerset police officers to the Crown Prosecution Service for potential criminal offences and has also referred Avon and Somerset constabulary for potential health and safety offences.”
The spokesman added: “Following the inquest in April 2013, the IPCC received complaints from Mr Herbert’s family regarding Mr Herbert’s treatment by police officers on the day he died; the evidence given by police officers during the course of the inquest; and the instructions given to the force’s barrister during the inquest.”
It is understood the file sent to the CPS covers actions at the time of Herbert’s death and what was said and done during his inquest.
Deborah Coles, director of the charity Inquest, which has been supporting Herbert’s family since his death, said: “This was a very disturbing death of a highly vulnerable man in a mental health crisis who died in police custody. James’s family have endured a long and painful wait for truth and justice. We hope the CPS will deal promptly with the evidence before them.”
Once again, the case focuses attention on the number of deaths of people with mental health issues in custody. In 2014/15, 17 people died in or following police custody. Eight of them were identified as having mental health concerns and 10 had been restrained.
An Avon and Somerset police spokesperson said: “Since the tragic death of Mr Herbert in June 2010 the constabulary has fully cooperated with the IPCC throughout each stage of the investigations.”
After the inquest, Herbert’s family said he had been “trussed up like a chicken” during his 45-minute journey to the police station. They said: “No person should have been subjected to that journey, let alone a mentally ill one in a highly distressed state. It was inhumane.”
His family said he did not have a malicious bone in his body. They said: “He will never have a chance to overcome his problems, fulfil his potential, fall in love, have children of his own, and enjoy football, the internet, parties and talk endlessly about the meaning of life. His life and his future were stolen from him.”
They added the “most shaming thing” was that the officers and the police force “were far more concerned about absolving themselves from criticism than from owning up to and thereby learning from their terrible errors”.
The case comes just a few weeks after an Avon and Somerset police officer and a community support officer were convicted of misconduct in a public office following the death of Bijan Ebrahimi, a refugee with disabilities, in Bristol. The pair failed to protect Ebrahimi, who had complained his life was under threat in the days before he was murdered by a neighbour and his body set on fire."

An inquest into the death from a gunshot wound of a young female soldier at Deepcut 20 years ago will not consider whether there was a “culture of sexual abuse” at the army barracks, a coroner has ruled.
Opening a fresh inquest into the death of Pte Cheryl James, 18, discovered with a single gunshot wound to her head at the Surrey barracks in 1995, coroner Brian Barker QC said: “This is not a public inquiry into the culture at Deepcut in the mid-1990s.”
James was one of four recruits to die from gunshot wounds at the army base between 1995 and 2002.
Fresh inquest may shed light on mystery Deepcut shootings Read more
At a pre-inquest hearing last month it emerged there was new evidence that suggested she may have been sexually coerced or exploited by senior ranks shortly before her death. At least 10 witnesses are said to have come forward with allegations of a culture of sexual exploitation at Deepcut, according to the human rights organisation Liberty, which is representing the family.
Barker, sitting at Woking coroner’s court on Monday, said evidence James may have been sexually abused at the time of her death fell within the scope of the inquest, but the question of “whether there was a culture of sexual abuse at Deepcut barracks, including the sexually inappropriate treatment of female recruits within the chain of command” did not.
It would be a “full, frank and fearless investigation into Cheryl’s death, but that does not mean the scope is unlimited,” he said.
James, from Llangollen, north Wales, had just completed initial training when she was found with a bullet wound between her right eye and the bridge of her nose at 8.30am on 27 November 1995. She had been posted alone, dressed in battledress and armed with an SA80 rifle, on gate guard duty. The original inquest, which lasted an hour and was held three weeks after her death, recorded an open verdict.
Barker said: “Any allegation of previous sexual harassment or abuse will fall out of scope of the inquest and cannot be pursued by questioning.” He added he would review this ruling as the evidence develops.
The inquest would examine whether a third party was involved in any policy shortcomings regarding lone guard duty, sexual behaviour, supervision and support of new recruits – particularly females – and surrounding drugs and alcohol.
James’s body was exhumed last year for forensic tests.
The inquest, which is due to last seven weeks and is expected to hear from more than 100 witnesses, was adjourned until Thursday as it emerged that new reports on pathological and scientific evidence had only just been submitted – one report was received two hours before the hearing – and needed to be considered.
Speaking before the hearing, her father, Des James, 66, told the Press Association that there was a drug and alcohol culture at the camp that was “out of control”.
“The bottom line is a culture was created at the camp which contributed to the death of four people,” he said. “The Deepcut situation is the tip of the iceberg. We have to get to the bottom of what happened. I want justice for all four of them.”
He told the BBC his 20-year fight for justice was no longer just about his daughter, but for parents up and down the country who “place recruits in the care of the state”. There was “no wrong verdict” for him, he said, “as long as the process is impeccable”. He added that when the army told him in 1995 that his daughter had killed herself, he initially accepted it, but alarm bells began to ring when the inquest was held after just three weeks.
The family had requested that the scope of the hearing be widened to take account of new evidence that they believed shed fresh light on her state of mind.

The family’s barrister, Alison Foster, QC, told a pre-inquest hearing last month that they had material suggesting James “may have been sexually coerced or raped the night before, or before the time of her death”.
There was also a “direct allegation” that the teenage soldier may have been ordered to sleep with a person “by someone superior in rank to her”, Foster said.
Privates Sean Benton, James Collinson and Geoff Gray all died from gunshot wounds at Deepcut over a seven-year period.
In 2014, the high court ordered a fresh inquest into James’s death after quashing the open verdict.
Surrey police almost immediately handed over the investigation into her death to the Royal Military Police.

National Archives|Margaret Thatcher|Conservatives|Andy Burnham|Labour|news,2016-02-01T18:55:04,guardian,Nicholas Watt,Andy Burnham says PM running risk of appearing to want to cover up details of ‘danger years’ of Tory government in 80s,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/01/labour-challenges-cameron-over-release-of-thatcher-archive-papers,Labour challenges Cameron over release of Thatcher archive papers,en,UK,,"Andy Burnham says PM running risk of appearing to want to cover up details of ‘danger years’ of Tory government in 80s
David Cameron is fuelling suspicions that he wants to prevent proper scrutiny of the “danger years” of Margaret Thatcher’s government after the number of Downing Street papers from the mid-1980s released under an official scheme fell by 90%, Andy Burnham has said.
The shadow home secretary said the prime minister appeared to be placing barriers in the way of studying a “divisive period” in British politics which included the aftermath of the miners’ strike and the preparations for the poll tax.
Burnham spoke out after the House of Commons library confirmed a fall in the number of Downing Street papers released last December under the official 20-30 year rule system. The library confirmed that 58 papers from Thatcher’s office from 1986-88 were released in December 2015 compared with around 500 papers from Downing Street and the Cabinet Office released in every previous December since 2010.
Burnham told the Guardian: “David Cameron came in and promised he would lead the most transparent government ever. That promise lies in tatters today. People will be deeply suspicious that he is drawing the curtain over the danger years of the Thatcher government when the Tory party was at war with many groups of people across our country.

“There are people today still campaigning for truth and justice relating to that divisive period in our country’s history. The actions of this government are putting yet more barriers in their way.”
Burnham said the prime minister risked giving the impression that he was trying to prevent disclosures about the Thatcher government during the late prime minister’s controversial final years in No 10.
Thatcher was criticised for being a divisive leader during the 1984-85 miners’ strike, when she warned of the “enemy within”, and for losing touch with voters when her government introduced the poll tax, which was levied on individuals and took no account of the value of their property. The poll tax played a part in the downfall of Thatcher and was scrapped by John Major after he succeeded her in 1990.
Burnham said: “There were a whole series of issues from the mid-1980s onwards that remain highly controversial and highly contested – from the miners’ strike and its aftermath to the piloting of the poll tax to the development of the football supporters’ ID card scheme.”
Cameron is unlikely to feature in any government papers from the period because he had a party political role when he first started working at Conservative central office in the final years of Thatcher’s term in office. But Oliver Letwin, the cabinet’s current policy chief, and John Whittingdale, the culture secretary, both served in Downing Street under Thatcher.
Letwin apologised in December after the papers from 1985 revealed he had challenged cabinet calls for assistance for black youths in the wake of inner city riots on the grounds that money would end up in the “disco and drug trade”.
Burnham will highlight the government’s apparent reluctance to release cabinet papers at a seminar he is hosting at Westminster on 9 February, which is designed to highlight the dangers of official secrecy.
The seminar will be attended by representatives from the Hillsborough campaign, the Stephen Lawrence campaign, the Orgreave Truth and Justice campaign, which is campaigning against what it describes as police lies during the miners’ strike, and the Shrewsbury 24 campaign, which is campaigning for the quashing of the convictions of construction worker pickets, including the actor Ricky Tomlinson, from the 1970s.

Burnham said: “There were a whole series of issues that caused social strife and are still live campaigns today. That is why I am bringing those people still campaigning against historical injustice together so that we can identify those barriers to them finally achieving truth and justice. This apparent selective application of the release of cabinet papers is an issue that is hindering their efforts.”
The government has admitted that it “fell short” when so few Downing Street papers were released in December. But it blamed the fall on the new system under which official papers are due to be released after 20 years. Previously they were released after 30 years. There is a 10-year transition period covering the years between 1984-2001 when two years’ worth of papers are released at once to achieve the 20 years release target.
The Cabinet Office will soon be transferring more papers to the National Archives in Kew, south-west London, to allow more to be released this year. This will mean that papers up to 1990 will be released by December.
All government papers have to be checked in Whitehall – to see if they need to be redacted or withdrawn on national security grounds – before they are transferred to Kew. The change in the release date from 20 to 30 years, combined with a move to releasing documents throughout the year, meant the system has “not been perfect”, according to the Cabinet Office minister Rob Wilson.
A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “The Cabinet Office is working with the National Archives to update the entire process of how and when we release files. We are working towards releasing files after 20 years, rather than 30 years and files will be released more frequently throughout the year, rather than a single annual event. We are committed to being the most transparent government ever.”"

A prosthetic leg, a life-sized Spider-Man doll and “enough musical instruments to form a band” have been lost on London’s travel network.
More than 300,000 items were left on the capital’s trains and buses last year as Transport for London received a record haul of missing goods.
Aside from the more peculiar finds, thousands of electronic tablets, umbrellas and wallets were also handed in to TfL’s lost property office – described as a wonder emporium by manager Paul Cowan.
Alongside the daily haul of around 150 mobile phones, the office has received a full-size house carpet, a judge’s wig and a hoard of musical instruments, including drum kits.

Last year, 22% of the 302,714 items handed in were returned to their rightful owners including a brown envelope containing £15,000, and an urn of ashes that had been kept by workers at the lost property office for almost seven years.

Cowan, who calls his job “one of the best”, said the number of items lost on the network would increase as more passengers used the service.
“The number of properties lost is fascinating, every day we’re getting well over 1,200 items of property found across the network, it’s staggering,” he said.
“Every item that comes in here has a definite story behind it. There’s the usual suspects, umbrellas, hundreds of books and documents and travel passes, but dispersed among that there is all the things that make you scratch your head, what were they doing carrying that or what were they doing with it.
All items handed in to TfL end up at the three-storey building next to Baker Street station and are stored for three months before being donated to charity, sent to auction or recycled.

Each year thousands of umbrellas, items of clothing and bags are donated to the British Red Cross, Scope and the Salvation Army through the scheme.
Cowan said: “There are many successes and it is one of the most gratifying parts of the jobs, because it is not just us involved. It could be the cleaner who finds the item on a train or a bus, it could be another passenger, it could be a member of TfL staff.”
“Getting the item back to the customer and seeing the smile on their face is fantastic.”"
Apps|The Observer|Games|reviews,2016-02-01T08:00:22,guardian,,"From a reworked boardgame to the brilliant GTA, a new crop of games for iOS",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/01/gaming-apps-iphone-review-grand-theft-auto,"Grand Theft Auto, Brass, Power Hover, Dungelot review - new gaming apps for the iPhone",en,tech,,"Making the most of the relative paucity of major console releases early in the year has traditionally seen a good crop of gaming apps released into a cold, dark January. This year is no exception with colour and light illuminating the gloom from mobiles across a variety of genres – indeed, even the humble boardgame has proved susceptible to a makeover.
It’s been done beautifully in Brass (Cubio, iOS, £3.99), which recreates an excellent table-top title set in the north of England during the Industrial Revolution. The idea is to build up cotton mills, coal mines and iron works and connect them through a series of canals and railroads, without going bankrupt. The rules can be daunting so it’s well worth playing on an iPad at first to make reading the text prompts and various cards easier. The tutorial doesn’t do the best job, so hunt around online for a full PDF of the rules. Perseverance does pay off, however, and once you are up and running there is a rewardingly complex challenge to discover, which can be enjoyed both online and offline. With every tiny mistake you make at the start resulting in dire consequences later on, it’s certainly not easy, but failure only increases the desire to learn and improve, making for a compulsive just-one-more-go experience.
If that all sounds a bit daunting, Power Hover (Oddrok, iOS, £2.99) combines a spot of 1980s nostalgia with simple action to create something impressively fresh. Tap left or right to steer the board through cartoon levels, avoiding obstacles, swerving lasers, performing tricks and collecting batteries to stock up on essential extra lives. The constantly swooping cinematic camerawork adds an extra dimension, but it’s the fluid movement of the board that really thrills – Marty McFly would certainly approve.
Power Hover
In contrast, Dungelot: Shattered Lands (tinyBuild, iOS, £2.99) offers a slightly deeper experience, plunging an adventurer into a dungeon that is crawling with zombies and other beasties and combining a bit of everyone’s favourite 90s time-sink, Minesweeper, with a classic Rogue-like smash and grab. You tap on unrevealed squares to find the key out of the room. Sometimes, the key will be first up and the adventure moves on, but more often there’ll be food, some character buffs, loot and vicious monsters intent on destruction that must be defeated to progress. The battles are satisfyingly tricky and the character-building elements add a welcome level of indulgence.
But it’s Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories (Rockstar, iOS, £4.99) that really demonstrates how comfortable an iPhone is emulating dedicated gaming devices. Recreating the 2005 PSP hit to wonderful effect, it’s GTA just as one would want, but the missions are slimmed down, making for a more suitable mobile experience than the fully-fledged remakes of Vice City and San Andreas that are also available. The visuals are pleasingly retro, and it’s hugely impressive that a phone can handle a game of this depth."

It was 100F on the red carpet and the sweat (and alcohol) was pouring out of me. I thought, “I am never going to be this unprepared again.” So the night before, I don’t drink and have an early night so I’m fresh and ready.
I work with a stylist called Sabina and she will give me the heads up on current trends. On the day of a big event, it takes me an hour to an hour and a half to get ready. I am told that some actresses literally get out of bed and start getting ready: it’s hair, choosing a dress and then makeup and nails. It’s much more fun for ladies, of course, because they get to wear colour and jewellery; for guys, it’s pretty much a tux and tie. Sabina has taught me how to tie a bow tie, so I am pretty chuffed about that.

For formal occasions, the studio sends a groomer and, to be honest, they don’t usually do much to me – not that I am flawless. They slap a bit of foundation on and perhaps some concealer under the eyes. I usually get a barber friend to give me a trim that morning.
You always want to look your best at events like the Globes, Emmys or Oscars. It’s a part of the business that I am not particularly comfortable with. I would prefer to turn up in a pair of jeans and an old shirt, but it’s all about image – the studio wants you to look your best.
On the red carpet, one tip is to suck in your cheekbones – apparently it looks better on camera. I don’t know, though, I think a nice smile is best.

It’s called Girlfriends’ Guide To Divorce. I love that show for so many reasons. It’s not just a show for women, men can get involved and learn something from it. It’s about relationships. The second season is reminiscent of a west coast version of Sex And The City. Just these women: they’re unique, their personalities, their friendships, and their relationships. I get so excited about that show.

I’ve always had a nerd brain. My father was a doctor and it’s always fascinated me. I’m Googling Mastermind right now, though, and it looks very intimidating! Just a spotlight and a chair.

Obliged by the government to provide a pension scheme into which all our employees will automatically be kettled, we’ve made sure that our small publishing company will be ready on time. But it is a small business – we have only one employee who qualifies. He plans to opt out of the pension scheme, as is his right, and regards the decision as simple: he prefers to take what remains of his pay now after PAYE and national insurance, rather than lose a further part of it for whatever £35 a week will be worth in 20 years’ time. We have, then, wasted time and money setting up a scheme that no one will use.
If the government is seriously concerned that the nation is not saving enough for its old age, here are three simple ways in which it might have tackled the problem without wasting the time of people like me:
1. Increase NI contributions. What could be simpler or more logical?
2. Amend monetary policy to provide an incentive to save. In recent years government policy has encouraged profligacy while penalising thrift.
3. Direct a new wave of quantitative easing at the problem. Apparently the UK printed £375bn between 2009 and 2012. I make that roughly £6,250 a head – a handy piece of pump-priming.
Who will benefit from the workplace pension scheme? The financial services sector, clearly – beyond that, it’s hard to be sure.

• Steve Webb, the pensions minister in the coalition government who was responsible for accelerating the timetable in 2011 to raise the state pension age of women to 66, later said “I pushed too hard and too fast on raising women’s state pension age”. As women born in the 50s, we entirely agree with his candid appraisal; as a consequence of Webb pushing “too hard and too fast”, half a million women now have to wait at least five years longer for their state pension – and those who had the misfortune to be born a few months too late, now have to wait until they are 66. This highlights an insensitive disregard for the 50s women who now have to plug a six-year gap in their anticipated income.
Steve Webb should honestly add that not only was he too fast, too hard but also he was too furtive. John Major’s government abandoned the changes. Future governments failed to notify women that these changes were being implemented.
We believe that this government should make transitional or bridging arrangements to help women who have unfairly borne the burden of the increase to the state pension age. We ask that all women affected should sign the petition organised by the campaign group WASPI (Women Against State Pension Inequality) and contact their MPs to add even more momentum to fighting the injustice of the 2011 act.

• What an innovative approach to solving the ubiquitous problem of government underfunding of public services, to press beneficiaries of services to voluntarily give them up (Pensioners’ anger over BBC licence campaign, 26 January). This must be an idea that could be widely applied elsewhere, beyond the BBC.
Obviously old people should be targeted first, because they are so numerous and so expensive. The NHS could advise pensioners to take more, longer walks – on short piers – and to keep warm by going to bed early in cold weather, taking a week’s supply of sleeping pills to ensure a peaceful night. Otherwise they are likely to be heavy users of health services in the last six months of their lives.
No need to restrict it to this age group. For example, children should be encouraged to truant much more often so that we’re spared the expense of building more classrooms and employing more teachers – and every part of the welfare state should be required to come forward with its own similar proposals.
Such new thinking is essential, because we all know that what money we have is required centrally to reduce taxes on the rich while still being able to command international respect by sending our forces all over the world, and having a nuclear war button that we could press.

Skiing holidays|The Observer|Ski resorts|Alps holidays|Italy holidays|Budget travel|Europe holidays|features,2016-01-31T14:00:08,guardian,Katie Forster,Beginner skier Katie Forster and her friends find a budget break in the Alps full of unexpected twists and turns,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jan/31/skiing-holiday-in-the-italian-alps-for-beginners-on-a-budget,No-frills snow thrills: skiing on a budget,en,travel|europe,,"Skiing isn’t meant to be like this. Surely there’s no point in four girls going on an Alpine winter holiday unless it’s to live it up in a catered chalet, popping bottles in the chopper before bombing down a black run with a film crew in tow? Or at the very least a drone.
Instead we’re staying halfway up a mountain in a tiny apartment. As we drag our bags round the bends of the near-vertical road, my friends raise their eyebrows at me and I hope it’s not much further. I flex my fingers beneath my mum’s old gloves, realising they were probably warmer in the 80s, and continue uphill.

At least the views will be good. The sun catches the tips of the Italian peaks as it sets on the town of Breuil-Cervinia, which we’ve left behind at the bottom of the valley. It looked much nearer on Airbnb.
The other obvious problem is that none of us can ski. Or not much. One total beginner, a couple of “intermediates” (our word) and a sort-of snowboarder. “I’ll give you ladies a discount,” winks the owner of a local ski hire shop when we reveal our incompetence. He introduces himself as Gianpaolo. “There’s not much snow, but you can ski down from here to the town. Watch out for rocks.” Rachael, the beginner, winces.
Our plan is to hit the slopes as much as our limited experience allows, on a post-Christmas diet of pizza, hot chocolate and cheap Italian red wine. We’ve chosen Cervinia, a small resort on the Italian-Swiss border in the Aosta valley, under the summit of the Matterhorn. It’s meant to be good for beginners, with lots of easy and intermediate-level pistes. But to reach them from our apartment, we have to wait for an erratic local bus each morning.

High-altitude Cervinia has the best snow record in Italy but, as in many other Alpine resorts, the Christmas period has not been kind. Apart from the main pistes, which are sprayed with fake powder, the surrounding forests are patchily covered at best.
“Are those people… walking?” asks my friend Eva on the chairlift, which rocks precariously as we turn to look. I spot a middle-aged couple trekking between the trees and I’m glad none of us is planning to go off-piste.
Last year my boyfriend went skiing for the first time with a friend, and they boasted that they hadn’t taken any lessons. Instead they relied on YouTube videos to pick up the basics. We’re not quite so bold, but we also can’t afford a full week of ski school, so while Sophie heads off to practise her snowboarding, Eva and I try to show Rachael the ropes.

“Lean down the mountain and bend your knees,” I say to her, trying to remember how to do it myself. The three of us wobble down to the first marker post. We’re overtaken by a stylish Italian ski instructor in a red jacket, followed by a line of tiny children going at twice our speed. “OK, come on. It’s only a baby run. Follow me,” I say, picking up momentum as I turn.
Rachael overtakes me. “Well done!” I say, proud of my teaching skills. But she keeps going, past the ski school group, which quickly moves out of the way. She flies by the red tarpaulin “slow” sign, her arms outstretched, veering dangerously close to the button lift, and falls, You’ve-Been-Framed!-style, near the bottom of the slope. Eva and I aren’t much better. But despite the lack of awed onlookers or elegant serpents of piste in our wake, we collapse in laughter as we high-five at having finally made it down the slope.
“I think I’m going to go professional,” says Rachael later, over a round of €5 glasses of prosecco in town. The streets are still decorated with fairy lights clustered in star shapes. It all feels very grown-up – at least until we get back to the apartment, where last night’s dinner has been bubbling up through the shower.

“Is that broccoli?” says Sophie, picking at it with a tissue. There’s a faint smell of gorgonzola in the air. I call our host. She’s working in a bar 200km away, so can’t help. We borrow some drain cleaner from the neighbours. The catered chalet seems very appealing all of a sudden.
As the week goes on things continue to improve. Rachael takes some lessons, while Sophie impresses us with how suave she appears on her snowboard – and how many times she manages to fall over. We toy with the idea of going to Switzerland, but it transpires that everything is three times as expensive, and the coffee three times worse, so the feeling passes. Eventually we ski the whole way down the mountain, which I’ve never done before. On the way we pass Lake Goillet, which may be artificial but in its frozen state looks like an Ansel Adams shot. Ansel wasn’t much into selfies, but we take one anyway in tribute.

At last the snow falls, in heavy drifts. We are all trapped on the mountain for the night, so we order more Spritz cocktails and watch as a group of Brits on a package tour complain loudly about their rep and baffle the Italian bar staff with descriptions of a Jägerbomb. The showoffs can keep their swooshy turns and their GoPro cameras. I’m glad that we’ve done skiing our own way.

Though, to be clear: the Stan was still sighted often during the shows (I wore mine, battered to death as they are), but there are also several contenders stepping forward to steal their crown.
Raf Simons for Adidas
If you accept that the Stan’s popularity is founded upon its simplicity and adaptability into an everyday uniform, then the latest Adidas design from Raf Simons for autumn/winter 2016, as seen at his knockout show in Paris, have fashion hit written all over them.

A simple black canvas pump with a red logo and red line running through the sole, these shoes will suit a cropped swingy trouser – very much a thing – come next season. And let us not forget that Simons, along with Phoebe Philo, has been a great ambassador for the Stan, with his “R” version. Though, interestingly, he took his runway bow in proper shoes, but we’ll return to that later.
Converse All Stars
Simple hi-tops are also having a moment (Marni put versions of them on its recent runway), particularly when teamed with hacked-off jeans. Converse All Stars in classic monochrome have been seen throughout this menswear season; Nick Grimshaw wore a pair on the front row at Burberry during London Collections: Men.

Designer Agi Mdumulla, one half of London-based duo Agi & Sam, is also a fan, wearing them on the catwalk earlier this month. The designer traces his love of them back to 2002. “Naturally, I have always had much more of a kinship with things that are a bit more humble and, I guess, often retro – rather than the newest Yeezys, or the technical trainer trend of 2012,” he says.

New Balance
New Balance has had a sterling season. Designer Gosha Rubchinskiy has been wearing them; the fashion editor of L’Uomo Vogue, Robert Rabensteiner, (previously a Stan fan) wore various NB styles throughout the month; while Junya Watanabe put them on his catwalk, worn with jeans sporting a 90s-style deep turn-up. David St John James, fashion director at Port magazine, was front row at Valentino in a pair. The stylist explained he liked them because they are comfortable but also – rather ironically now – because they were a bit non-fashion. “I took inspiration from those elderly gentlemen you see with impeccable dress sense – suit trousers, a tie, a mac and a pair of New Balance. All rather Forrest Gump,” he says, with a wry smile.

Reebok Classics
Despite taking his bow in a pair of New Balance, Rubchinskiy put his models in a classic Reebok for his autumn/winter show held at Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, in Paris. Wearing jeans and track trousers yanked up high, the boys all wore the same classic Reebok trainer, in both hi- and low-top, in either black or white. The Reebok branding on the side of the shoe was replaced with PACCBET, which has previously appeared on the designer’s T-shirts. This is a shoe that will go cult. Quickly.

High-end options
There are two other sneaker brands that are not to be discounted from the Stan replacement race. First, there’s Common Projects, purveyors of clean lines and minimalist designers. These are regularly worn in fashion circles, though they have yet to go mass.

Ditto the relative design newcomer Eytys, which hails from Stockholm and whose designs, including its signature Mother shoe, are equally lo-fi and slot easily into a uniform. For next season, the brand is adding a faux-furry lined style, which rather nicely ticks the secret luxury box.

Personally, I’m also a fan of a white Velcro trainer, which French label AMI has done for both this season and next. FYI, there is always the Stan Velcro version if you can’t bear to be parted from your beloved shape.

Is the new Stan Smith a shoe?
But let’s end on some controversy. If we return to Simons wearing a classic shoe to take his runway bow (not that this is unheard of – he regularly wore shoes for bowing in during the Dior era), Adrian Clark, style director of ShortList thinks that, rather than having reached peak Stan, we’ve actually reached peak Sneaker. “For the first time in quite some time, I am not feeling the sneaker. It feels like it has run it course. Athletic footwear has reached saturation, mainly due to the relentless trend for sport luxe designer wear and apparel,” he says. Instead, Clark is backing a “rounded toe, classic derby” for next season. Imagine it. Plain shoes as the new Stans? What do you think?"
Crime|Opinion|Ireland|Students|Higher education|Feminism|Women|comment,2016-02-01T15:45:04,guardian,Megan Nolan,The first consent lessons in Ireland may be on their way. Opponents of this don’t seem to appreciate the scale of the problem,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/raped-at-university-sexual-consent-lessons-trinity-college-dublin,"I was raped as a student, and I back sexual consent lessons for freshers",en,opinion,,"When I was in university in Dublin there was a memorable moment of outrage concerning a student club night poster. It showed a photograph of a woman looking unsteady in stilettos, attempting to pull up underwear from around her ankles. The tagline was “If You’re Not Up For It, Don’t Cum”. The message seemed to be: if you enter this venue, you are implicitly agreeing to abandon your right to selectively consent to sex. You are fair game and should expect to be treated as such. Student journalists and members of the Feminist Society were rightfully outraged. But the response from many was as predictable and boring as the poster: it was just a laugh; loads of people liked it; what about free speech? After all, it was just a bit of banter. Banter – the last squalling gasp of a particularly brainless and inarticulate brand of masculinity.
Sexual consent is simple. We should all be clear what constitutes rape | Alison Saunders Read more
I thought of the poster last week, when news emerged that Trinity College Dublin, where I went at 18, is to consider introducing mandatory sexual consent lessons for freshers in their halls of residence. Such programmes already exist in many UK universities, but this will be the first of its kind in Ireland. A quarter of female Trinity students responding to a 2014 survey saying that they had been sexually assaulted, so you could be forgiven for thinking that most rational people would be grateful for any action taken to address this. But I had forgotten the current panic in some quarters about the much mythologised “safe space”. Apocryphal rumours of Stasi-style censoring of Shakespeare and Homer abound. Apparently we now live in a society in which “free speech” is characterised by the right of a Cecil Rhodes statue to stay standing (at least so long as his defenders still have £100m to hold over Oriel College’s head).
So it should not have surprised me that some people have come out in opposition to Trinity’s new consent classes. In the Irish Times, columnist Fionola Meredith argues that attempting to influence the private sexual behaviour of adults is invasive and insulting to students who would not commit rape. Besides the obvious point that there is unfortunately no current litmus test with which we can definitively earmark potential rapists, Meredith seems to fatally misunderstand the broader value of a conversation about consent.
Thousands of teenagers will be arriving from single-sex faith schools into a culture built on habitual binge drinking. It will probably be the first time they have unfettered, unsupervised access to sexual partners. Consent lessons will be mandatory for everyone, for all genders and sexualities. The lessons are not only used to define consent and the ways in which it should be sought, but they attempt to create a base level of awareness, sensitivity to the nuances of victimhood, and a communal inclination to condemn predatory behaviour in no uncertain terms and without exception.
The support I needed is not currently evident on campuses
University, full of fragile egos and unformed identities, was a constant struggle to assert one’s self. Who would be successful? Who was attractive? Who was clever? It was the first time I had been around a lot of truly rich people at once, and I marvelled at the seemingly inbuilt confidence of the pink-trousered privately educated boys who dominated the societies. They were the performers of the smoking area, the loudest in seminars, the most popular at parties where they always had the best drugs and most absurd liquors. They were plaintive and sensitive when you wouldn’t sleep with them, aloof and cold once you had. It was always overwhelmingly macho.
I discovered, years after my own assault, that I knew several other women who had endured the exact same particular circumstances I had. Would our attackers have been deterred by consent lessons? There is a chance, a not insubstantial one, that a pervasive and commonly expressed disgust for such acts would cause a potential rapist to fear social consequences.
What I learned in a sexual consent class at Oxford Read more
There is a chance that if such a culture existed, I would have immediately reported my rape and felt no shame about the fact I had been drinking. As it was, I kept it secret for an unfeasibly long time, by which point my mental health had deteriorated to the extent I hadn’t seen a pre-3pm sky for six months and had long since dropped out. Who knows how differently things might have been if I had instinctively felt that I would be supported both by the university and my peers?
The support I needed is not currently evident on campuses. The culture at many universities does not exist in a vacuum – it does real violence. It compels you to laugh along with it even as you are being brutalised. The Irish Times shouldn’t be asking why Trinity students need to take consent lessons. Consent lessons are the bare minimum attempt to address an enormous, institutionalised problem which shames us all. They should be demanding, along with everyone else, that this is only the beginning of a radical refusal of male violence."

My loathing of treadmills is well documented on this blog, and I hold to my theory that treadmill miles relate to outdoor miles in the same way that dog years relate to human years - they are at least seven times longer. Which makes the fact that Susie Chan ran for 12 hours on a treadmill on Saturday (68.5 miles) breaking the world record in the process particularly jaw-dropping for me.
It’s not so much the physical exertion that amazes me, though heaven knows that’s impressive enough. No, it’s the mental effort. It would be one thing to run 68.5 miles in a line, towards a destination, with a physical finish line to cross. But in a room, on a treadmill? That requires an effort of will I can’t even begin to imagine. Well done Susie. Possibly a rest day today though, eh?
My own weekend involved a curtailed track session, dropping out with a worryingly niggly calf, followed by a very tentative long run yesterday of 16 miles. Plenty of calf raises and stretches for me over the next few weeks, and fingers crossed that it doesn’t develop into anything more serious.
So, how was your weekend running? I saw lots of Winter Run medal-wearers getting off various tubes and buses on my meanderings around London yesterday and spotted quite a few PBs on Strava too. As always, share your own exploits below the line."

Julianne Moore’s chartreuse dress has been described, variously, as “puke” and “gorgeous” by the charming fashion critics of the internet this weekend, which is about as divisive as a frock gets. The dress is the most challenging shape and colour from Givenchy’s most recent couture collection and would always have represented a bit of a risk. All in all, the red carpet looked a lot less princessy this weekend – and given that these dresses are being worn by some of the most powerful women in Hollywood, individuality over bridesmaid-chic must be good news.

This dress comes straight from Versace’s most recent couture show – which was athleisure-themed, hence the climbing-rope ties – but we need to talk about the shoes. They are platforms, and perilously high platforms, at that. Larson was far from the only star wobbling around in towering shoes of the kind Victoria Beckham lived in before her fashion transformation. This underlines the fact that no matter what happens in the rest of fashion, stylists will squeeze actors’ feet into shoes solely designed to make their legs look longer, regardless of trends or wobbles. In other words, even after the great Cannes flat-shoe revolt of 2015, red-carpet progress has not really reached ground level.

Trump makes it a choice between vanilla and hemlock. With his prejudice, bombast and bullying, he is a epochal divider.
And now he was dividing me and my sister.
Our four grandparents had immigrated from eastern Europe, where they weren’t wanted, to America, where they were greeted with dismay: four penniless Jewish teenagers without a word of English, already churning out kids. They worked in the sweatshops, and their kids became doctors and researchers and business owners.
I believe that immigration is synonymous with hope. I used to think I shared that idea with my sister – until she complained that LA’s notorious traffic was due to undocumented Mexican immigrants. I joked: “Maybe they think the problem is poky ageing Jewesses.” She didn’t laugh. “So the answer to gridlock is deportation?” I asked. To me that was a punchline; to her … a solution? She didn’t respond, and for a while we dropped the subject and confined our correspondence to sharing links to cute animal stories.

But weeks later, she lobbed at me how mile after mile of Los Angeles was now “Mexico”. I returned that her (hefty) husband must be joyous, since he can’t get enough Mexican food. That remark laid a big huevo.
Barely two years apart, we were always close. We rode hobbyhorses together. We cheered ourselves hoarse as our painted turtle, Lolita, plodded to third place in the Minneapolis turtle races. When it rained, we collected soaked, desolate sticks to nurse tenderly in our stick hospital.
How, after sharing so much, could we fall away?
We both majored in English. I became a writer; she became a speech pathologist and a poet. I married an outgoing guy whose politics mirrored mine. Her more aloof husband kept his views close, but I couldn’t miss my sister’s continued turn to the political right. In a letter she referred to “left-leaning liberal Jews” abandoning their support for Israel. Now that was getting personal.
When she said she was “about ready” to vote for Trump, my response was: “You can’t be serious.” But there’s no dodging the fact that by now she is, indeed, serious.

Supporting Trump is a lot different from turning into moderate Rockefeller Republicans, as my mother’s successful brothers did when I was a child. That had been a family scandal. There is nobody in our extended family who supports Trump; in fact, he is a standing joke, albeit now a scary one. We are all whistling in the dark about a Trump win. All – except for the family member most important to me.
My sister is petite; a meticulous, fashionable dresser, while I, a full six inches taller, have always been the family Lurch, with my sarcasm and bluntness. I say the wrong thing even when I am being cautious, so imagine the effect of the vitriol I so relish launching on Trump and on those followers I consider his patsies.
My sister’s husband and I maintain an uneasy truce of decade-long duration. I suspect him as the culprit who “turned” her, but this is dangerous terrain. I’m not going to let Donald Trump come between me and my sister. I fear him like I fear a boomslang. And I may beg her to be sure before she votes, but that’s the last I’m ever going to say about it.

Inflation|Opinion|Quantitative easing|Australian economy|Business (Australia)|Paul Keating|Reserve Bank of Australia|comment,2016-02-01T21:39:38,guardian,Stephen Koukoulas,Paul Keating breaking the ‘stick’ of inflation in the early 1990s has contributed to Australia having one of the highest standards of living in the world,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/02/the-key-to-australias-economic-success-locking-in-low-inflation,The key to Australia's economic success: locking in low inflation,en,opinion,,"When Paul Keating “snapped the inflation stick” in the early 1990s, he delivered one of the most valuable, potent and lasting reforms to the Australian economy. Sustained low inflation with a specific target was, in many ways, as important as the decision to float the Australian dollar.
Decades on from this economic fracture, Australia has one of the highest standards of living in the world and has not had a recession in a generation. Last week’s December quarter consumer price index confirmed annual inflation running at just 1.7%, meaning that, over the past 25 years, inflation has averaged 2.5%, which is in stark contrast with the 1970s and 1980s, when annual inflation averaged a destructive 9.2 per cent.
Last week’s December quarter consumer price index confirmed annual inflation running at just 1.7%
Low inflation is important for many reasons but the boost to living standards for low and middle-income earners is among the strongest.
When an economy can lock in low inflation over an extended time frame, as Australia has, it means that those who receive even modest increases in wages and pensions have the purchasing power of their incomes at least maintained, if not improved.
When Glenn Stevens releases his statement after the Reserve Bank of Australia’s monetary policy meeting on Tuesday, there is no prospect that he will say the inflation target is not being met. But if disinflation risks were to build, the RBA would cut interest rates. In an extreme case that deflation risks build even with interest rates cut to zero, the RBA has signalled that it would consider copying the US Federal Reserve and other central banks by embarking on quantitative easing or moving interest rates below zero.
Over the past 25 years, the average growth in wages, pensions and most welfare payments has been significantly higher than inflation. This means that the purchasing power of the household sector has increased, year in and year out, underpinning economic expansion.
For example, let’s say a person earns $100 and spends it on the goods and services they need and want. They have zero savings. With inflation at 2.5% and income growth of 3.5%, after one year the same goods and services will cost $102.50 but the person’s income will have risen to $103.50. This means they have an extra $1 to save for the future or spend now.
Global markets end tumultuous month on a high Read more
Over a decade the gains are even more pronounced with the price of goods increasing to $128, while the person’s income will have risen to over $141, meaning a life-changing 10% rise in purchasing power.
Low inflation has other benefits for the economy, most notably low interest rates.
For the business sector, the threshold for profitable investment is lowered, which benefits the economy and enhances capacity for productivity growth. Business will increasingly be focused on investment decisions that will add to profitability through innovation and efficiency rather than undertaking a speculative business expansion on the assumption that a high inflation rate would “pay off” the debt. This asset price inflation investment strategy was a problem that dogged Australian commercial property in the late 1980s and, in many ways, exacerbated the depths of the early 1990s recession.
Well run, prosperous and productive economies inevitably have low, relatively stable rates of inflation. Thanks to the structural lowering of inflation and the subsequent decision of Keating, the then treasurer, Ralph Willis, and the then RBA governor, Bernie Fraser, to target inflation, Australia has been a shining light of the global economy for many years.
It is a target that has been hit with freakish accuracy, especially given some of the big picture economic thrills and spills over that time.
Breaking the “stick” of inflation and locking in low inflation is an under-appreciated reform of the early 1990s that thankfully has bipartisan political support. Given the contribution low inflation has made to Australia’s economic wellbeing over that time, it is hopefully a target that is never altered.
And there is little or no doubt that over the next three or five or 10 years that inflation will average between 2% and 3% and Australia will be all the better for it.

For a small guy he’s been making big waves, inspiring global press coverage and online jubilation from Lego fans, parents and disability groups.
“But he’s just a little guy,” I hear you say, “a plastic dude out for a wheel in the park with his dog and a bunch of other mini-figures. What’s the big deal?”
Lego unveils first ever minifigure in wheelchair Read more
The message behind Lego’s wheelie boy is so much larger than his teeny-tiny stature. His birth in the toy box marks a seismic shift within children’s industries. There are 150 million children with disabilities worldwide, yet until now they have scarcely ever seen themselves positively reflected in the media and toys they consume.
In her recently published book Disability and Popular Culture, Australian academic Katie Ellis writes: “Toys mirror the values of the society that produce them …” If Lego is mirroring, it’s reflecting a better world. Intentionally or not, it has sent out a powerful message of inclusion.
Lego seems to have been unprepared for the excitement its wheelchair-using boy would cause. When he rolled on to the stands of Nuremberg Toy Fair, Lego wasn’t treating him as anything special – he was just nestled among the crowd. The company hadn’t prepared any photos for journalists and, when approached by the Press Association, could only say that he would reach the shops in June. Yet the figure’s very existence was noteworthy, so unusual that he grabbed the headlines during a week of international toy fairs. (Alongside big-bottomed, flat-footed “normal woman” Barbie – but that’s a whole other story.)
How do you grow a positive self-esteem when the culture around you appears to place no value on your existence?
The delighted response only highlights the size of the void that Lego’s wheelchair boy comes to fill. This beast is ravenous because we’ve never really fed it before.
The toys, TV, films, games, apps and books that entertain and educate our children barely feature children with any kind of impairment or difference. Their lives are not reflected. They’re invisible. How do you grow a positive self-esteem when the culture around you appears to place no value on your existence? It does not celebrate you. On the rare occasions when you are depicted, it’s frequently as a disability stereotype – in a medical setting (toy hospital set), as an evil baddie (Captain Hook) or associated with charity (BBC’s Children in Need). Your hopes, dreams, imaginations and experiences are ignored. You are culturally marginalised. Washed away by the mainstream. As the academic and bio-ethicist Tom Shakespeare – himself a wheelchair user – said, there’s a danger that disabled children will feel “like permanent outsiders in the world”.

When did you last see disability represented positively in a children’s film, cartoon, or computer game? Have you ever seen a set of emojis that reflect the disabled experience in a celebratory way? Alexandra Strick of Inclusive Minds, a group calling for greater representation of disabled children in publishing, says, “The disturbingly low number of books featuring disabled characters is a perpetual concern. I’m frequently asked for lists of books which feature disabled characters. It’s extremely challenging to find more than a handful.”
Everyone knows there’s something wrong with how we represent disabled people, but it seems no one knows quite how to fix it. We dance delicately around disability, scared to offend or get it wrong, so we don’t do it. This exclusion is causing damage to millions of children, yet the answer is quite simple. Just include it in an incidental, celebratory way. Move on from the baseline negative, which treats disability as somehow lesser, in need of fixing or overcoming, and see it for what it is – benign human variation, part of the spectrum of human life. Let’s hope that one day positive representations of disability are included so seamlessly across children’s industries that they cease to be noteworthy at all."
US news|Opinion|US elections 2016|comment,2016-02-01T16:15:04,guardian,Aj Bauer,The worldview of modern conservatives often runs counter to the standards of news judgment and accuracy. But history show factchecking rarely works,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/trump-may-win-iowa-bevy-lies-fact-checks-wont-stop-him,"Trump may win Iowa with a bevy of lies. If fact-checks won't stop him, what will?",en,opinion,,"If the lamentations of pundits are to be believed, the 2016 Republican presidential primary race has revealed the death of the fact. Donald Trump is in the lead as its primary assassin, with Politifact effectively declaring his entire campaign “Lie of the Year” in 2015 — to little effect upon his robust poll numbers leading up to the Iowa caucus on Monday night.
The inaccuracies and outright lies of Trump’s campaign have been stunning. Trump claims to have watched as “thousands” of Muslims in Jersey City cheered the fall of the Twin Towers. That never happened. He said Mexico deliberately sends criminals to the US, but there is no evidence of that either. Trump also erroneously said 81% of murders of white people were committed by black Americans. That number is actually closer to 15%.
Political psychologists have weighed in on why factchecking Trump might not work, blaming a “backfire effect” in which factual corrections seem to reinforce belief in misinformation among ideologically motivated individuals.
But there is also a historical case to be made against factchecking: an inability to reach consensus about what constitutes objective reality has been a consistent feature of US political culture for nearly a century, and efforts to inoculate the public against misinformation have only contributed to the dilemma they hoped to solve.
While modern political factchecking is relatively new, dating back only to the mid-aughts, historical precedents date back to when “new media” meant radio. As early as the 1930s, progressive scholars and journalists publicly worried about the susceptibility of the US general public to “reactionary” propaganda, a term that uncritically lumped together a wide array of rightist ideologies, ranging from the merely anti-New Deal to the ardently pro-fascist.
In the late 1930s, several leading social scientists launched the Institute for Propaganda Analysis in hopes of protecting the public from such misinformation. The institute issued newsletters and produced curricula designed to teach the public how to identify, and avoid being swayed by, common rhetorical strategies often deployed by propagandists of the time.
Like factcheck outfits today, the Institute was non-partisan, but its claims to scientific objectivity and balance were undermined by its thinly veiled progressive political orientation, which led to bias charges, including redbaiting by left anti-Stalinists and right anti-communists alike.
While its rhetoric-focused method was short-lived, the IPA and its antecedents, like progressive media critic George Seldes, inspired and helped spearhead media reform efforts in the 1940s, resulting in, among other things, the Fairness Doctrine, an FCC policy that required broadcasters to strive for ideological balance when airing commentary on controversial issues (its repeal, by the Reagan administration in 1987, paved the way for talk radio as we know it today).
From scholarly efforts like the IPA to federal regulations like the Fairness Doctrine, the 20th century is replete with efforts aimed at safeguarding the public against misinformation, with the “public interest” consistently defined against a putatively virulent “reactionary” ideology, thought to thrive upon misinformation and rhetorical chicanery.
Among the first concerted rightwing responses to these efforts was Facts Forum, a series of radio and later television programs funded by Texas billionaire HL Hunt in the early 1950s. Formatted to air “both sides” of controversial issues, the programs not-so-subtly skewed to the right. Facts Forum encouraged its supporters to form local discussion groups, which featured debates, amateur public opinion polling and letter-to-the-editor-writing contests.
Critics, from the Nation magazine to congressional Democrats, denounced Facts Forum for spreading “half-truths, distortions, generalizations and exaggerations”, while forum participants saw themselves as fighting “apathy”, and shaping public opinion in their own image. In doing so, Facts Forum actively cultivated and nationally synchronized an alternative interpretation of the news of the day, one rooted in a distinctly conservative worldview at odds with mainstream reporting of current events.
Facts Forum meetings, which popped up primarily in the southern and western communities that would later be called the Sun Belt, established the form and content for later efforts to mobilize conservatism at the grassroots, from the John Birch Society, to Young Americans for Freedom, to the Tea Party.
From its outset, then, the modern conservative movement has deliberately attracted supporters whose view of the world runs counter to the standards of news judgment and accuracy that underlie mainstream journalism. That those same standards have been historically shaped in relation to a presumed reactionary threat informs and bolsters this conservative skepticism of the news media.
Political factchecking is premised upon the self-evidence of facts, relying on a common sense that has not existed in the US for nearly a century (if, indeed, it ever existed).
Common sense is built through engaging in politics, which factchecking attempts to evade through mere assertion. Rather than quibbling over facts – endlessly, since we lack a shared standard for determining factuality – perhaps more focus should be placed on understanding exactly why conservatives believe the facts they do choose to believe."

So much for the northern powerhouse,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/bradford-museum-london-royal-photography-society-national-media-museum,Why must a Bradford museum lose its treasures to London?,en,opinion,,"For the past few years, for a change, there has been some good news coming out of Bradford. The notorious Bradford Wastefield, a huge demolition site that disfigured the city centre for more than a decade, has at last been built over. The beautiful Bradford Odeon cinema has been spared the wrecking ball and is awaiting development. The renowned National Media Museum has escaped the threat of closure, significantly increased its footfall and secured some new funding.
Museums are now part of Britain's pernicious north-south divide Read more
It’s depressing, then, to have to focus on bad news. Especially depressing because this is an announcement that has significance not just for a once great and now struggling city, but for anyone who cares about the United Kingdom functioning as an entire nation, rather than allowing it to subside into a series of wastelands around the inaccessible citadel of London.
Focus of Bradford photo archive shifts south to the V&A | Letters Read more
This weekend the Victoria & Albert Museum in London and Bradford’s National Media Museum quietly put out a press release explaining that the Royal Photography Society’s world-renowned collection was moving from the National Media Museum, its home since 2003, to the V&A.
The National Media Museum is not closing. It will now, as the press release puts it “focus on the science, technology and culture of light and sound and will retain material relevant to that”. But as local MP Judith Cummins suggests, this looks like the thin end of the wedge, another paring down of Bradford’s resources “by stealth”, and a serious blow to the long-term prospects of the National Media Museum. She says: “It was just over three months ago that I received assurances from the government both about keeping the museum here in Bradford and importantly keeping the entry free. Visitor numbers have been rising so to now learn that an important collection, which is 10% of the collection as a whole, is to be shipped off to London starts alarm bells ringing.”
Michael Pritchard, the director general of the Royal Photographic Society, also says the move is “disappointing”, but there were serious practical considerations behind the decision: “The move of the RPS Collection to London from Bradford will increase accessibility in both a geographical sense and through the resources that the V&A is able to bring ensure public and research access. The Media Museum has suffered declining staff and funding cuts over recent years which has impacted on public access to the collection despite the very best efforts of the curatorial staff.”
Let me put that in a less diplomatic way. A museum in Yorkshire cannot afford to curate this collection as well as everyone might wish. A museum in London can. Therefore a world-class institution in a northern city is going to have to give up some of its biggest treasures because it doesn’t have sufficient funding – but the magic porridge pot in the capital somehow keeps on giving.
This is significant for a fine institution. As Colin Ford – the first director of the museum – says, the plan was always that “the Royal Photographic Society collection should be at the heart of the collection”. But this move also has troubling implications outside of the world of photography, as Ford points out: “When we set up it was government policy to put things like that outside London – and it’s supposed to be government policy now isn’t it? The ‘northern powerhouse’. But what we’ve really found is that metropolitanism is triumphing again.”

Do people in London get more from seeing exhibitions? Are their opinions more important? I can see something in the idea that placing the collection in the V&A may make life easier for – say – visiting scholars, but then again are there not plenty of train and airport connections to Bradford? Are not hotel rooms and everything else to do with the cost of living significantly cheaper in Yorkshire than in London? Given that most students can now barely afford to live in the capital, who exactly benefits from moving more resources there?
It’s also not as if there isn’t already significant academic life centred around the National Media Museum in Yorkshire. “It’s important that we have a collection on our doorstep,” says Casey Orr, a local photographer and academic at nearby Leeds Metropolitan university. “There’s a huge problem in education in the north. We always struggle to keep hold of funding and losing this collection is a massive blow. Our kids need this. Our communities need this.”
Are we to suppose that those communities are of less value than those in London? How else are we to read such an assault on the prestige of Bradford?"
Beyoncé|Opinion|Coldplay|Super Bowl 50|comment,2016-02-01T16:32:27,guardian,Anthea Butler,"Hymn for the Weekend’s lyrics don’t require an Indian backdrop, so here’s hoping Coldplay decides to give the song different visuals at the show",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/super-bowl-halftime-show-coldplay-beyonce-cultural-appropriation-india-bollywood,Coldplay and Beyoncé: skip the cultural appropriation for Super Bowl halftime,en,opinion,,"Coldplay’s Hymn for the Weekend video featuring Beyoncé is already caught in a heated conversation about cultural appreciation of Indian religion and culture versus cultural appropriation of that culture for the western gaze. The video is a beautiful work of cinematography, yet it is untethered from meanings of religious and social significance the imagery contains.
The song is on deck to be performed at the Super Bowl halftime show this weekend, watched by millions of Americans and countless others around the world. Here’s hoping that Coldplay has decided to give their song a different visual cue, rather than trying to make the Super Bowl into a religious festival and a Bollywood extravaganza at halftime.

In the last few years, Indian culture has been used in videos by MIA, Major Lazer and Iggy Azalea, among others. In each of these videos, western artists are foregrounded as having a blast, while Indians are background dancers and set decoration. These videos, along with Coldplay’s, continue a long, dubious tradition of depicting India as a backdrop for western fun and enlightenment. Hymn for the Weekend mixes cultural and religious practices, commodifying them into a banal, but beautiful message of imagined solidarity.
I’m sure many people will say I’m overstating the case and talk about how political correctness is ruining everything. After all, it’s just a video, right?
Coldplay: only the latest pop stars to misrepresent India as an exotic playground Read more
But music videos, despite being on the wane from their days of MTV dominance, still have a way of conveying culture to people who will never have a chance to visit exotic places or understand that, while hennaed hands are beautiful, they do have social and religious significance. Desis on Twitter, Facebook and social media have denounced the video, commenting on the penchant for western artists to commodify their religion, culture and fashion.
It all reminds me of a line from Edward Said’s Orientalism: “From the beginning of Western speculation about the orient, the one thing the orient could not do is represent itself.” The wonders of India and Mumbai are seen through the eyes of Chris Martin and Coldplay, while Beyoncé, not Sonam Kapoor or another Indian actress, is depicted as a blonde Bollywood screen queen and goddess.
With blonde hair, green eyes and seemingly bleached-out skin, Beyoncé stands as a message to both black women and Desi women: if you want to be beautiful, light skin, light eyes and blonde hair is the way to go, no matter what clothes you are wearing. In India, that message has been a terrible burden for women. If director Ben Mor wanted to appreciate, and not appropriate, a Bollywood actor should have won her role.
The other issue with the video is the depiction of religious practices. Priests in saffron robes, a child dressed as Lord Shiva, a sadhu balancing on a rope and a celebration of the Hindu festival of Holi lend an air of mystery to the video, but for what purpose? For anyone with little knowledge of India or Hinduism, the depictions of various religious practices simply add to the exotic element of Mumbai, dissected from their true meaning, becoming simply video entertainment.
The debate between appreciation and appropriation has a long history. While I am not Desi, I do know that I am still not buying Beyoncé, an African American woman from Houston, Texas, as a Bollywood queen. While Chris Martin has a deep interest in yoga spirituality, it does not make him an expert on how best to portray Desi heritage.
There will be no room to rehash these errors or mistakes of cultural appropriation when Coldplay and Beyoncé perform together at the Super Bowl on 7 February. The conversation of cultural appropriation versus appreciation is especially important for the NFL as it seeks to expand its fan base to London and all over the world. Avoiding the music video’s mistakes at the performance would be a good start."
Zika virus|Opinion|Health|World Health Organization|comment,2016-02-01T22:09:00,guardian,Celine Gounder,There won’t be a Zika vaccine for several years. We must act in other ways to stop the virus from spreading,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/zika-virus-public-health-emergency-what-must-do-now,The Zika virus is a public health emergency. Here's what we must do now,en,opinion,,"Now that the World Health Organization has declared the Zika virus a public health emergency, we must remember one thing: we can’t turn the clock back on globalization. There is no role for travel or trade bans unless we issue mosquitoes passports and restrict their movement – a ridiculous notion.
Almost six million foreigners travel to Brazil every year. It is estimated that another half a million will travel to Brazil for the Olympics, just under half of whom are expected to be Americans. Travellers returning from the Olympics could carry Zika back to the US, but it’s only a matter of time before that happens anyway. With its warm, humid climate, much of the US south is an ideal habitat for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the transmitter of Zika virus.
But a higher standard of living, including better home construction and air-conditioning, insulate Americans against mosquitoes. Our water and sanitation systems reduce our exposure to standing water, where mosquitoes like to breed, and we have robust mosquito control programs to keep local populations in check. While we could see clusters of Zika transmission in pockets of extreme poverty, it is highly unlikely to become a widespread problem as in Brazil.
The Zika virus foreshadows our dystopian climate future | Bill McKibben Read more
Though Zika and Ebola are two very different diseases, there are some parallels. Both are fundamentally diseases of poverty. Safe running water, improved hygiene and sanitation and better housing would go a long way towards reducing the risk of Zika in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Frustratingly, our aid programs favor temporary emergency measures, not investment in long-term infrastructure that would help control the current outbreak and prevent future ones. We’re oddly reluctant to intervene in a way that would provide unintended benefit.
We’re farther away from having a vaccine or effective drugs for Zika virus than we were for Ebola at the start of that epidemic. While funding Zika vaccine development is necessary, such a vaccine won’t arrive in time to protect this generation of babies, particularly once you factor in the complexities of testing a vaccine for use in pregnant women. We can’t afford to wait.
Zika virus: World Health Organisation declares public health emergency Read more
Meanwhile, we do have a potentially very potent tool to control mosquitoes: genetically modified male mosquitoes, engineered to have offspring that die before reaching adulthood, which is when they can bite and transmit disease. Clinical trials of these genetically modified mosquitoes should be expedited, as were trials of experimental Ebola vaccines and drugs. An added benefit of this approach is that it would curb transmission of many mosquito-borne illnesses, not just Zika virus.
As temperatures rise and rain patterns change, the regions where mosquitoes can thrive and spread disease are expanding. Dengue is now the most important mosquito-borne disease worldwide, infecting 50 to 100 million per year and killing 22,000, mostly children.
We’ve seen a fourfold increase in dengue since 1970. Although tremendous progress has been made in the fight against malaria, over half a million still die, again mostly children, of the disease per year. Rather than starting a new disease-specific program from scratch, it may make more sense to expand the geographic scope of the President’s Malaria Initiative to include Latin America and the Caribbean.
Maternal health remains a major problem in much of the world. Over 300,000 women die in childbirth worldwide per year, more than 7,000 of those in Latin America and the Caribbean. Contraception and safe abortions reduce the risk of maternal death, but are largely inaccessible in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the WHO chief declare the Zika virus a public emergency.
Though Catholicism has certainly played a role here, American foreign aid policies have made it more difficult to deliver comprehensive family planning services worldwide. Since 1973, the US agency for international development (USAID) has been barred from using its funds to directly support abortion services overseas, and beginning in 1984 under Republican administrations, the agency has been blocked from funding non-governmental organizations that provide any abortion-related services, even if that funding supports other activities.
If there’s anything we’ve learned from the last three global public health emergencies – polio, H1N1 and Ebola – it’s that hi-tech solutions like new vaccines aren’t fast enough to stop an epidemic. Yes, we must invest in research with a view to the future. But so long as poverty, population growth and climate change fuel the emergence of new infectious diseases, we will be playing catch up with our hi-tech solutions. We need to address these diseases at the source."
Education|Opinion|comment,2016-02-01T22:45:58,guardian,Robert Hortle,"114 years after his death, Cecil Rhodes is still causing controversy, and the discussion has relevance for Australia and the way we talk about colonisation",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/02/rhodes-scholars-can-you-justify-taking-the-money-of-the-godfather-of-apartheid,Rhodes scholars: can you justify taking the money of the 'godfather of apartheid'?,en,opinion,,"For most Australians, he’s just a name attached to a fancy scholarship. But 114 years after his death, Cecil Rhodes is fast becoming a symbol for the emerging decolonisation movement – something with a lot of relevance to our country.
The past few months have witnessed an increasingly prominent campaign to think about Rhodes more critically, sparked by the Rhodes Must Fall (RMF) campaign at the University of Cape Town. RMF has now come to Oxford, where it recently secured a commitment from Oriel College to remove a plaque attached to a statue of Rhodes. However, the campaign has become a punching bag for the British media, with many commentators deriding it as “petulant” and “political correctness gone mad” . Now the Australian media is taking up a similar line. In the January 16-17 Weekend Tasmanian, Charles Wooley included a few sensationalist paragraphs about RMF, referring to it as an “academic Taliban”. Two weeks earlier, the Australian published a critique of the campaign featuring a misleadingly positive spin on Rhodes’ life . Rhodes scholar and former prime minister Tony Abbott has also weighed in, calling the campaign an expression of “moral vanity” and claiming that Rhodes was just a man of the times.
Cecil Rhodes was a racist, but you can’t readily expunge him from history | Will Hutton Read more
Amid all this, it is important to remember that even by the standards of 19th century colonialism, Rhodes was considered too bloodthirsty and dogmatic in his belief of British supremacy . As premier of the Cape colony, Rhodes masterminded the infamous Jameson raid, an attack on Afrikaners based in the Transvaal that became a military disaster and led to “an unbroken sequence of evil” . He established the British South Africa Company’s police, a private army implicated in the deaths of thousands, violently annexed land, and reintroduced the torture of black workers into law. The Guardian’s own obituary for Rhodes, published in 1902, describes him as an unscrupulous “wrecker” of South African development .
I learned about Rhodes’ crimes when I decided to apply for the scholarship in 2013. I wondered how I could justify taking his money, if I was lucky enough to get the scholarship. Then I read an article by Rhodes scholar Nanjala Nyabola. She argued that for her, taking Rhodes’ money was a way of defying the “godfather of apartheid” because he never intended people like her to go to Oxford on the back of his ill-gotten wealth. Unlike Nanjala, in many ways I’m exactly who Rhodes intended the scholarship to go to: white, male, and middle class. However, my goal was to use the scholarship to study international development and be part of the fight against the devastating ongoing effects of colonialism. This fits well with the new direction of the Rhodes scholarships. To use the words of “Redress Rhodes” – a group of past and current scholars – the scholarship has been reshaped to be “more inclusive, representative, and encouraging of advocates of social justice than it was at its inception”. I took the money because I believe in that vision.
I’ve never talked about racism, sexism, and other forms of overt and structural discrimination as much as I have in Oxford over the past 18 months. Campaigns like RMF encourage everyone to think about these issues, which might otherwise go unnoticed for people like me. The goal is not to “whitewash history”, shut down critical debate, tear down a few colonial statues, or make white people feel guilty, as critics of RMF have suggested.
For my black and ethnic minority friends, it’s about acknowledgement that their experience of everyday life in Oxford is very different to mine due to the prevalence of “casual” racism. It’s about the lack of scholars from diverse backgrounds on many Oxford course reading lists. And it’s about the fact that this institution has only relatively recently opened itself to a more diverse range of students. For me – as a white, middleclass, male – it’s about trying to understand what my friends are experiencing, instead of just saying “I’m not racist, so what’s the problem?” It’s not about sympathy, but respect for their achievements and a commitment to be more aware of the privilege conferred by my own colour and gender.
The whole debate in Oxford has been eye-opening and useful, but it makes me wonder why we aren’t having similar conversations in Australia. The foundations for this are present: there’s been some discussion of decolonisation ; Stan Grant has been eloquently questioning the inclusiveness of Australia Day and the Aussie identity; the Adam Goodes saga brought underlying currents of racism to the surface; and the reconciliation movement has a strong tradition of encouraging discussion of Australia’s colonial history. But we’ve also seen backwards steps, such the call for a greater focus on Australia’s “Judeo-Christian” heritage in the national curriculum. We haven’t reached a mature level of debate that adequately acknowledges past wrongs and the role that privilege plays in our society.
Cecil Rhodes statue to remain at Oxford after 'overwhelming support' Read more
Australia needs its own version of RMF. We need to start thinking more critically about Rhodes himself, because even though he operated half a world away, he’s had a big impact on Australia: four of our previous eight prime ministers have studied in Oxford under his name. The defensive, knee-jerk reaction to RMF in the Australian media shows that this conversation has a long way to go. More importantly, we need to encourage a new generation of young Australians to understand the darker elements of our history, such as the colonial era atrocities against Indigenous Australians.
We also need to be looking for positive solutions to the structural racism that still exists in Australian society, and encouraging our government to be bold in taking on these challenges. The health gap between Indigenous Australians and the rest of the population, the lack of minority representation in parliaments across the country, and the racist undertones of the recent border force farce are just a few examples. Addressing these issues needs frank, honest, and mature debate.
RMF is a tricky campaign to engage with for someone like me. It’s easy to slip into feeling like you’re the target; that anything you say might offend someone; that you don’t have a right to have an opinion on these issues; that I might be accused of whitesplaining. But just because these are difficult issues doesn’t mean we should avoid them. On the contrary, this is a conversation Australia needs to have."

But can it help our reporter with a Scouse accent? Hannah Jane Parkinson finds out
I’m a big fan of travel. Travel is great – whether it is the Trans-Siberian railway or trekking in the Amazon. And from Citymapper to TripAdvisor, technology has made travel a lot easier.
But perhaps my favourite travel aide is Google Translate.
The web version of Translate has always been handy for deciphering comments from my overseas “fans” (admittedly, often what I hope are compliments turn out to thinly veiled abuse, but life is cruel). But since Translate launched as an iOS and Android app with text, speech, image and video input options, the possibilities for overcoming language barriers have rocketed.
Translate now serves 90 languages and is used by 200 million people. The app allows you to speak directly into a smartphone microphone and have the speech translated into either text or audio (according to language preferences). This is a genuinely brilliant way to have face-to-face conversations with individuals who speak different languages.
Scouse is not a different language, but it may as well be.
Scouse, the word for a Liverpudlian accent, elicits polar reactions. People either love it or hate it, if they understand it. It is a very distinct dialect. I can say this as I am a Scouser.

Not only is the accent elaborate, adorning words with extra vowels, or sometimes chopping off whole syllables, but there also exist specific Scouse words and terms: “trabs” for instance, to mean trainers. The accent has evolved over time, from the 60s lilt of the Beatles and Cilla Black to the quick patter of the post-match Steven Gerrard interview.
As someone who moved abroad at 18, and then lived in Oxford for a while, and now lives in That London, my accent isn’t super strong. But it is recognisable. And it comes back brilliantly when I go back up to the Pool.
I started to wonder what the limitations of translation apps like Google Translate and other voice activated and recognition software are when it comes to understanding regional accents. If you are speaking to a person from a different country who is struggling to understand their accent and call on Translate to help – will Google understand?
I decided to find out how Google Translate would deal with the rolling rs and glottal stops of a strong Liverpool accent.
Is it as helpful for people with regional accents as for those speaking received pronunciation? I tested how well Google deciphers the speech input of a Scouse accent when translating it into various languages, and back into English.
•••
The first Liverpudlian vernacular I tested was: “Go ‘ed, lad”. Which is essentially a measure of encouragement. You might yell it at a football player streaming up the right wing, bearing down on goal. (In Liverpool, everyone is “lad”, regardless of their gender).
To Google, “go ‘ed, lad” was translated into French as content (“content de”), it thought I’d said “glad”. When I typed, rather than spoke, the same Scouse phrase into Google to translate into Danish, the result meant “go oath boy”. I will scream this from the terraces the next time I am at Anfield and report back.
“He’s doing my head in you know, I might just sack him off” is roughly equivalent to saying, “this guy is really annoying, I think I’ll dump him”. But to sack something off can mean to decide against something in general.
googletranslatescouse
This translated into Dutch as: “Is there with me I do not know maybe I just suck them off”. If you are a fellow Liverpudlian and on a weekend jolly to Amsterdam, do not rely on the Google Translate app. You will end up sexually propositioning someone via word-salad.
And it didn’t matter how many times I tried “devooed” (devastated), it came out as “devilled” in every language. Which isn’t even a word. Except in the egg sense.
“Jarg”, which is a Scouse term to mean rubbish or a knock-off, is translated into Russian as вминать or “dent”.
“Proper auld (old) man, like” translated, vaguely accurately, into Japanese as 以下のような適切な老人, or “appropriate elderly, such as”.
“Going the offy for some ale” ie going to the off-licence for some booze, perplexed Google, which when translated into Portuguese thought I was saying “going the office for some mail”. So if I’m ever out with some Portugese or Brazilians and I need to go on a wine run, they will assume I am saying: “going to the office for some emails”. This is not how I usually end a Friday night out, especially if on holiday.
“Soz abar you”, a legendary Scouse utterance, a phrase to throw shade, becomes “songs about you”. Quite romantic. This is definitely not in the ballpark of what “soz abar you” is supposed to mean.
“On me bill” (on my own), was either rendered as the name Amy Bell, or “unable”. In Latin, Google tells me this translates as non potuerunt, or more literally: “I could not”. As in, “I could not have a conversation with a foreigner using Google Translate if I had a strong Scouse accent”.
“Proper boss scran” (great food), in Greek becomes “Good boss, Graham”.
Google Translate does not recognsie “gegging”; one of the best Scouse terms. “Gegging in” is to earwig or intrude upon. There is a brilliant way of letting someone in Liverpool know that you have realised they are eavesdropping, which is to say to your interlocutor: “Have you seen that film? Arma-GEG-IN?” and then pointedly throw the gegger a look. Admittedly, this is something that should probably be confined to the schoolyard.
When I say “You gegging in?” Google refuses to acknowledge that I am not saying “You going in?” Which is pretty arlarse of Google.
I then wondered whether Siri, Apple’s “voice recognition personal assistant”, would fare any better.
“Are you gegging in?” I asked, which seems a fair question, given the recent scrutiny and privacy concerns related to microphones in devices and app settings, some of which might, by default, be recording all of the time, 1984-style. Siri, however, thought I was saying “are you gay in it”, and responded with “I can’t answer that”.
Not quite what I meant … Photograph: Hannah Jane Parkinson
Does Siri understand other Scouse phrases? “Is right, lad” and “That’s arlarse”, was met with: “Sorry, I missed that”.
I emailed Google to ask whether it might consider developing a Scouse option for its Translate service.
“Translate should be able to recognise Scouse as an accent almost immediately (and the more you use it, the more it will learn, so the Liverpudlian community is counting on you!)
“It doesn’t recognise slang terms, just accents for now - but perhaps that’s something that will be added to the Translate library in the future.”

Facebook does not have the greatest track record with its Android app. Users have long complained about performance issues and it sucking up battery and last year Facebook’s chief product officer, Chris Cox, took the unusual step of making his staff ditch their iPhones and move to Android until they sorted out the issues.
But the problems have remained, and recently they led the Android blogger Russell Holly to dump the app, starting a chain reaction which revealed something rather interesting about the app’s performance. Prompted by Holly’s revelation that life on Android was better without Facebook’s app, Reddit user pbrandes_eth tested the app’s impact on the performance of an LG G4.
They found that when the Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps were uninstalled, other apps on the smartphone launched 15% faster. They tested 15 separate apps, and documented the findings, leading other reddit users to test other devices. They found similar results when testing for app loading performance.
After reading Holly’s piece, I had also decided to explore other options for accessing Facebook, to see if, rather than app loading, I could improve my smartphone’s battery life.
I left the Facebook Messenger app installed, but swapped the Facebook app for an app called Metal, which acts as a wrapper for Facebook’s mobile site. Over the course of a day my Huawei Nexus 6P had 20% more battery. This was true on average for every day for the week tried.
In Metal I was using the same notifications and accessing the same features as I had just a week earlier through the Facebook app, so why the difference?
Despite the Facebook app not showing up as using a significant amount of power within Android’s built-in battery statistics, it was evidently consuming more power in the background than it needed to.
It turned out other Android services including Android system and Android OS showed reduced battery consumption when the Facebook app was uninstalled. Those services act as a buffer for many apps to the outside world when running in the background. So while Facebook didn’t look like it was using that much power, it was actually just being displayed elsewhere in Android’s statistics.
So, uninstalling the Facebook app saves both battery and speeds up Android phones, it seems. Obviously, it may be less convenient not to have the apps, but there are several substitutes that allow you to access the mobile site within a wrapper, like Metal that I used.
Alternatively, you can simply use Facebook within Chrome on an Android phone: recent updates have enabled notifications for actions, chats and other features from Facebook even in the background, meaning the experience is very similar to using an app.
Either way, until Facebook improves its Android app, ditching it could save you 20% of your battery life a day, and speed up your phone.
A Facebook spokesperson said: “We have heard reports of some people experiencing speed issues stemming from our Android app. We are looking into this and will keep you posted. We are committed to continuing to improve these issues.”
The company made no mention of battery life issues, however."
YouTube|Internet|news,2016-02-01T11:23:02,guardian,Alex Hern,YouTubers hit back at Fine Bros’ attempt to trademark word over fears that the pair are trying to seize entire concept of the reaction video format,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/01/youtube-network-plan-trademark-react-sparks-backlash,YouTube network's 'react' trademark attempt sparks backlash,en,tech,,"YouTubers hit back at Fine Bros’ attempt to trademark word over fears that the pair are trying to seize entire concept of the reaction video format
An attempt to trademark the word “react” has ended badly for the YouTube network Fine Brothers Entertainment, with former fans unsubscribing from the group’s main channel en masse in protest.
The network, which was launched by brothers Benny and Rafi Fine in 2007, is one of the most popular on YouTube, with 14 million subscribers. In 2010, they launched the series Kids React, which involved the pair showing children videos – initially other popular vial videos – and filming their reactions.
After becoming a hit, the series led to a huge number of spin-offs, including Teens React, Elders React, YouTubers React (featuring other famous YouTubers, some of whom were filmed watching their own videos) and Adults React. In 2014, the quantity of videos had reached a critical mass, which led Fine Bros to spin them off into their own YouTube channel called React.
Having established their dominance over the reaction video format, Fine Bros expanded further. In July 2015, they registered a trademark application for the word React, covering “Entertainment services, namely, providing an ongoing series of programs and webisodes via the internet in the field of observing and interviewing various groups of people”.
Last month, they announced React World, a new initiative allowing fans to create their own React videos, licensing the rights to the format from Fine Bros alongside production guidance, format bibles and graphics.
At the time, YouTube’s VP of content partnerships, Kelly Merryman, praised the brothers for their innovative business plan. “It’s no surprise that they’ve created a unique way to expand the hugely popular ‘React’ series to YouTube audiences around the globe. This is brand-building in the YouTube age – rising media companies building their brands through collaborations with creators around the world.”
The problem for the YouTube community is that reaction videos long predate the React format. The concept was most notoriously popularised around the infamous shock video 2 Girls 1 Cup, released in 2007. That year, reaction videos of unsuspecting people being shown the film went viral on YouTube, including family members, loved ones, and Louis CK.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest YouTubers react to Fine Bros’ trademark attempt.
As a result, YouTubers are reacting to Fine Bros themselves – without their permission. They fear that the entire concept could be hijacked by the pair, and Tristan Rayner, of tech news site Techly, catalogued a number of protest reaction videos from other members of the site:
The fear isn’t unfounded: the pair have frequently spoken out against others they perceive to be stealing the idea from them. They criticised Ellen Degeneres for running a reaction video on the Ellen Show, tweeting that it was “a shame to not have [the show] reach out to us”. And in March 2015, they said it was a “sad day for the web community” when Buzzfeed ran a reaction video of teens watching 90s music.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Another fan films his reaction to the decision.
Unrelated reaction video channels, including Seniors React and British Kids React, were forced to take their videos down, apparently after takedown requests from Fine Bros. In the case of Seniors React, that came just weeks before Fine Bros launched Elders React.
The Guardian has asked Fine Bros for their reaction to the backlash, but has not received a response."

Google bosses in California are expected to reveal global revenues grew by more than 11% to about $72bn (£50bn) last year – with more than £5bn believed to have come from sales to UK customers.
Alphabet Inc, the search group’s parent, is expected to confirm on Monday about one in 10 dollars earned last year by Google came from UK advertisers, despite the dollar strengthening against the pound.
A jump in the group’s UK sales – up from £4.54bn for 2014 – is likely to add to widespread anger at the group’s controversial tax structure, which ensures the revenue from British customers is booked in Ireland.
Much of the income arriving in Ireland is then squeezed through another Google company in the Netherlands before bouncing back to Ireland and Bermuda, a UK overseas territory and tax haven.
George Osborne had promised to stop multinationals diverting UK sales and profits overseas, but Google this month announced it had struck a deal with HMRC to continue the controversial arrangement.
Google’s UK business paid tax of just £21m for 2013. The British company’s soon-to-be-published latest accounts – for the 18 months to June 2015 – show it has agreed to pay back taxes and interest of £130m covering underpayments stretching back a decade.
Back in California, Alphabet is also expected to reveal on Monday that Google’s cash reserves, parked offshore, swelled by $4bn in 2015 to $43bn. Google will say in its annual report that this money is after-tax profits from its non-US markets, of which the UK accounts for 17% .
Last October, Google bosses showed Wall Street analysts how the group had generated about $5.37bn (£3.7bn) from the UK in just the first nine months of 2015.

They added that for July, August and September alone, the group UK revenues would have shown growth of 18% but for the fact that the pound weakened against the dollar.
Financial analysts at RBC Capital Markets have forecast Alphabet will report total revenue for 2015 of $74.5bn. Those at Morningstar estimate last year’s revenues could be as much as $75.4bn."

When Silicon Valley closes a door for spies, it opens a window.
That’s the conclusion of several former government officials, academics and privacy advocates in a study Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society released on Monday.
The report argues that despite talk that encryption from the likes of Apple and Google obstructs national security, these companies are creating many new technologies that will make surveillance easier.
That’s a notable finding because the study’s authors include several law and order types, such as Matthew G Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center for the Obama administration who is now an executive at IronNet Cybersecurity – a startup founded by former National Security Agency director General Keith Alexander.
It comes as many US law enforcement officials, including the FBI director, James Comey, have pressed tech companies to make sure they can access user communications even if they are encrypted as they travel the internet. Law enforcement officials often call this problem, “going dark”.
“Going dark is the wrong metaphor,” the report says. “Are we really headed to a future in which our ability to effectively surveil criminals and bad actors is impossible? We think not.”
Contributors included cybersecurity luminary Bruce Schneier, former Google senior privacy analyst Susan Landau and current government officials who could not be named because of their day jobs.
Law enforcement may start to seek orders compelling vendors of networked devices to intercept ambient communications
There are several reasons things may not be as bad as they seem for investigators. For one, encryption, which relies on complex math, is very hard to implement correctly. More importantly for technology companies, it can get in the way of their ability to mine user content to better target advertisements.
Moreover, consumers can adopt encrypted messaging apps, but they work on phones and computers that run other less secure software. This can often give prying eyes an opening, the report says.
And then there’s the bright side. As tech companies focus their attention on making more consumer products “smart” by connecting them to the internet, they increasingly open up new surveillance windows, the report concludes.
For instance, what good is an encrypted phone call if government investigators can listen in on the call through a microphone in a “smart TV” in the same room?
In one line that was particularly jarring given the report’s authors, the study suggested, “Law enforcement or intelligence agencies may start to seek orders compelling Samsung, Google, Mattel, Nest or vendors of other networked devices to push an update or flip a digital switch to intercept the ambient communications of a target.”
There are no publicly known instances of governments using court orders to target such technologies. But the prospect is intriguing.
“We argue that communications in the future will neither be eclipsed into darkness nor illuminated without shadow,” the report says. “Some areas are more illuminated now than in the past and others are brightening.”"

The near collision of a drone and a passenger plane over the Houses of Parliament should be a wake-up call for the government to speed up its review of unmanned aerial vehicles, Labour has said.
Richard Burden, a shadow transport minister, said the near-miss over central London and other recent cases should be a “spur to action” after delays in the government’s promised consultation on regulating drones.
“The case for greater regulation needs to be urgently examined, but there is real uncertainty over the government’s intentions,” he said. “Ministers promised a public consultation last year but it has already been delayed into 2016. This incident should be a wake-up call.”
The incident was revealed by the UK Airprox Board, which monitors near collisions in British airspace. In its latest report, it said a “silver drone with a balloon-like centre and four small rotors on each corner” was spotted by the pilot of an Embraer 170 at 2,000ft (600 metres) on 13 September 2015.
The report assessed the risk of collision as high and the pilot estimated that it was pure chance they did not hit each other.
The flight had been passing near parliament at a speed of about 184mph as it came in to land at London City airport. It was estimated by the pilot that the drone came within 20 metres of the jet, which can carry up to 76 passengers, passing down the left hand side of the aircraft.
The report also reveals that there were five other incidents involving drones between August and September last year.
Three near-misses involved passenger planes either coming in to land or flying out of large UK airports, including Manchester, Stansted and Heathrow. None of the drone operators in these cases, including the incident above central London, could be traced.
Current rules on the use of drones state that they must not be flown in any way that could endanger people or property. It is illegal for unmanned aircraft to be flown over streets, towns and cities – and they must be kept well clear of airports and airfields.
However, there have been increasing warnings from pilots and other experts that regulations need to be tightened, with better records of who owns and operates them. The government first said it would have a public dialogue on greater regulation in 2014 but the official consultation is now not taking place until later this year.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Drones are becoming increasingly popular and have the potential to bring significant economic benefits, but it is vital that they are operated safely, in a way that does not put members of the public and other aircraft at risk.
“The government is leading efforts with international bodies to develop a stringent regulatory framework focusing on safety. There will be a public consultation before a government strategy is published in 2016.”
The consultation is looking at a range of options including regulation, registration and licensing options and a database to increase transparency on the use of drones for the general public."

Transportable skills
Yoga instructors can work all over the world – and the initial training can be done abroad, too. The directory at yogaeverywhere.com lists residential training courses from France and Italy to India and Thailand. Would-be tour guides can gain qualifications from the Institute of Tourist Guiding and the Hospitality Guild, though many adventure travel companies are more interested in skills and attitudes. Exodus, for example, prioritises language skills, an interest in outdoor pursuits, experience of working with people of all ages and knowledge of a particular culture or region. Work as a massage therapist is another way to combine travel and earning. Well-regarded courses abroad include the Bali International Spa Academy and the Costa Rica School of Massage Therapy. Or how about training as a chef or a mixologist, and getting a job in a beach resort or on a cruise ship?
Teach English abroad

Marriage equality|Opinion|Australian politics|comment,2016-02-01T00:39:32,guardian,Kerryn Phelps,How did we get here? The idea of a plebiscite is a contemptuous device to sink the hopes of marriage equality actually happening,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/marriage-equality-should-be-a-lay-down-misere-instead-its-an-unholy-mess,"Marriage equality should be a lay down misere, instead it's an unholy mess",en,opinion,,"What an unholy mess the marriage equality situation in Australia has become.
In recent weeks Australia’s reputation in the developed world took a beating following the death a British man on his honeymoon with his husband in South Australia. Marco Bulmer-Rizzi was told that he was not recognised as next of kin and his father-in-law would have to approve any decisions. To complete the insult, his husband David’s death certificate would read “never married”.
Apologies from the South Australian premier ensued but the damage was done. The situation is inexcusable. Disgraceful. And it doesn’t have to be like this.
Most MPs and senators now support same-sex marriage, campaigners say Read more
For the first time in history we have the leader of the Australian government and the leader of the opposition who are declared supporters of marriage equality. Just last week Australian Marriage Equality announced that we now have the numbers needed to get a free vote over the line. Public opinion polls are consistently telling us that support in the Australian community is running at around 70%. Should be a lay down misere, right?
For supporters of marriage equality, this is not a time for sitting back and thinking it’s a no-brainer.
Given all of this progress, there should be enough cause for optimism but, in my view, paradoxically the threat to equality is as great as ever, but just with a friendlier face.
It may be a new year but we are going to have to face some old challenges on the path to marriage equality. The most potent threat is, in my view, continuing with the Abbott plan for a plebiscite, which we know was designed to derail the momentum for equality. You have to ask yourself why it is that the religious right is so enthusiastic about a plebiscite while the supporters of equality are so concerned.
Last week we heard news that former pm Tony Abbott, now a backbencher planning to stay on in parliament, has flown over to the USA to address a massively resourced anti-gay group from the religious right known as the Alliance Defending Freedom. This nasty group is opposed to abortion, wants to end gay marriage and is pushing to roll back some feminist advances. It seems the freedom they want to defend is their freedom to limit the freedoms of others.
Meanwhile, senators Eric Abetz, Cory Bernardi, and Bridget McKenzie enlightened the political situation in Australia with their announcements that even if the plebiscite result was resoundingly “yes”, they would still vote against equality.
Tony Abbott's speaking engagements deserve our scrutiny, and our concern | Jason Wilson Read more
How did we get here?
My wife Jackie and I were naive enough to think that news of our private religious wedding ceremony in New York in January 1998 would stay amongst friends and family. Within weeks our relationship was splashed all over the media and we were cast in the role of “gay activists”. Achieving marriage equality became a mission, however long it would take.
Back in 2004 the prime minister at the time, John Howard, sniffed the international breeze and realised that the introduction of marriage equality in the Netherlands and the impending move to equality in Canada would soon lead to a challenge here. In fact a number of couples were bracing themselves (us included) to submit documentation to be legally married here.
At the time, the Marriage Act did not specifically exclude same gender couples. We heard that marriage celebrants were warned that their licence to perform ceremonies would be cancelled if they submitted paperwork for same sex couples, while the government worked feverishly to change the Marriage Act to make sure same gender couples could not be legally married in Australia, or have any legal overseas marriages recognised. With the support of Labor the change to the Act went through as a matter of “urgency”. A stain on Australian socio-political history.
Since then there has been growing momentum to right that wrong.
Australian Marriage Equality emerged as a political force in 2004 as a response to the Howard amendments to the Marriage Act entrenching marriage as only between a man and a woman. Alex Greenwich, Rodney Croome, Shelley Argent, Geoff Thomas, Christine Forster and many others have become seasoned and unremitting campaigners.
Julia Gillard inexplicably blocked the road to equality in what I consider to be a shameful act of betrayal of her core values. A group of us met with her in the prime ministerial office suite in Parliament House in a bizarre interchange attempting to justify her position. When she was no longer pm, she belatedly “changed her view”, too late for us to achieve justice.
Same-sex marriage: Turnbull pushes on with Abbott's plebiscite, and it's still daft Read more
Kevin Rudd also obstructed progress during his prime ministerships, also to belatedly change his view.
No such change of heart from the next pm, Tony Abbott. The ultra-right conservatives felt quite emboldened during his tenure. Yet at great political risk to themselves, many moderates on the government benches started to “come out” as supporters of marriage equality. For a while there, it was looking like it might actually come to a free vote when Abbott and the Right pulled a swifty in the Liberal National joint party room and came up with a plan for a plebiscite after the next election.
“Let the people have a say!” They said, to sell the concept to the populace. How could anyone argue with a national people’s vote to guide the wisdom of our politicians?
But what they meant was “this is a truly ingenious and sneaky way to make sure marriage equality never sees the light of day in Australia.”
You might take some encouragement from events in Ireland where a referendum was passed by a massive majority and constitutional reform naturally followed.
A plebiscite is different. We do not need any changes to the constitution, just as Howard did not need a referendum to change the Marriage Act in 2004.
Let me make it clear. A referendum is a compulsory vote held at the time of an election when everyone is out voting anyway. The result is binding. If the people vote “yes” or “no” in a referendum, that is that.
Eight more votes. That's all we need for Australia to win marriage equality | Rodney Croome Read more
The idea of a plebiscite was a contemptuous device to sink the hopes of marriage equality actually happening. The Abbott government was prepared to waste over $160 million to do it, and the government now under Malcolm Turnbull are continuing with the plan.
A plebiscite is not a compulsory vote. The risk is that the well-funded and well-organised religious right will make sure they throw everything into a campaign to stop equality and they will turn up in numbers. Our real enemy could be apathy, or an assumption that marriage equality is inevitable. If the supporters of marriage equality do not turn up in greater numbers than those who oppose, the cause could be lost for many years to come.
A plebiscite also declares open season for equality opponents to “debate” our right to have our relationships respected and acknowledged as equal. I have been “debating” these unpleasant characters for almost two decades. They will use all of their tedious old dirty tricks. They will smile for the cameras while they misquote research and insult our relationships and our families.
I have heard the arguments that as prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull can’t do this on his own, and that he has to reflect the views of the coalition joint party room. It is up to him and any coalition politician with a gram of integrity and a desire to be on the right side of history to push their colleagues to dump this offensive plebiscite idea and move towards a free vote in this term of parliament. It is one of the most simple political actions this government could take.
This is a fundamental civil rights issue, and it’s time. In fact it’s well past time."
New Zealand|Opinion|comment,2016-02-01T04:36:10,guardian,Susan Mcdonald,"My ancestors’ story was New Zealand’s story, Australia’s too: peoples and cultures coming together, adapting to each other and to a changing world",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/i-met-the-ghost-of-my-maori-great-grandfather-on-a-wild-and-lonely-track,I met the ghost of my Maori great-grandfather on a wild and lonely track,en,opinion,,"I met my Maori great-grandfather Joe on a recent trip to New Zealand. Not in the flesh; he died long ago. But if, as Thoreau said, your ancestors “leave their footprints in the sands of time”, I picked up his trail on a windblown hill at the southernmost point of the South Island.
I knew the history: in the middle of the 19th century, two whalers – one American (Dennison “Yankee” Smith) and one Portuguese (Manuel Gomez) – jumped ship when they got to New Zealand, married two Maori sisters and settled on the otherwise uninhabited island of Bravo, in a Stewart Island/Rakiura inlet.
From where I stood it was 30km across the strait, but worlds away from my 21st century reality back in Sydney.
Joe was one of 30 children in two families on Bravo, leading what could only be described as a Spartan existence, even for frontier New Zealand: fishing, canoeing, hunting mutton-bird and pigeon, and growing what they could on the land. No reading or writing, although the children reputedly played music by ear. It was a hunter-gatherer existence not so different from the one led by centuries of Maori and Polynesian tribes that had come before them.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest The author’s great grandfather Joseph Smith, one of 30 children in two families brought up on Bravo
Of course, by Joe’s time it had already been a long journey for the South Island Maori, their numbers decimated first in bloody intertribal battles, then by the pakeha demons of drink and consumption. In 1844, the paramount chief was moved to say of the Europeans “they brought us plagues unbeknown to our fathers till our people melted away”.
Still, when they were old enough the Bravo children didn’t hesitate to migrate to the “civilisation” of the NZ mainland. Joe’s great grandfather had been one of 500 chiefs who had signed the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi with the British Crown; for my family the symbolic meeting of cultures had only to become reality.
There is nothing in my appearance, nor in my family’s customs or the way we identify ourselves, to suggest my Maori heritage, although I do remember a visit to my grandparents’ place and an impromptu poi dance by a Maori relative. But I stood on that hill, above where my ancestors had made landfall on their fateful journey to the modern world, and felt the invisible thread of family pull tight.
I took a track that promised to lead to the water’s edge and a better vantage point. It meandered at first, a slow descent through dense, pretty scrub; then got steeper in places; then darker as the scrub got taller, grew impenetrable.
A rocky outcrop appeared and my instinct was to clamber up to take bearings, as a submarine puts up its periscope in unchartered waters. But there was nothing but more scrub to be seen; it seemed to be spreading, the sea and islands beyond receding further into mist.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Settlement on Bravo Island in Paterson Inlet, Stewart Island, 1879, by Christopher Aubrey Photograph: Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington.
I stood still, the gnarl of dark undergrowth crowding me on both sides, and was taken suddenly by the sense of great-grandfather Joe down-track a bit, the only sound the rustle of the day’s catch of pigeon hanging from his heavy belt. My mind playing tricks? Perhaps. A ghost? Maybe.
Certainly, it was an intimation of the past, of ancestral lives lived, of Bravo. In 1907, a visiting botanist had described Stewart Island as an “actual piece of the primeval world”. Perhaps I had crossed the sands of time into that world, Joe’s world. I shuddered at the thought of being trapped in such a Tolkienesque wilderness.
I have wondered since if my grandmother’s Irish farming family was unnerved when she married my grandfather Joseph, Joe’s son.
Joseph junior grew up in the port of Bluff, where Joe had stopped on his way to civilisation, a rough and rollicking town of sailors and fishermen, where you were known by your nickname: my grandfather was Bravo, his brother Couta, his sisters Doll and Dude. It was a halfway house between the still-primitive island communities and the Europeanised mainland; Joseph’s family, the Smiths, sang American folksongs alongside Maori ones. It was a place where the past was hurtling at breakneck speed into the future.
My grandmother’s family, the Fords, had arrived from County Galway about the same time the whaler Smith had sailed from Massachusetts. They quickly became successful farmers in the new land: her grandfather to be eulogised in the local paper as a “sturdy, upright man”; her father president of the regional farmers’ union, staunchly Catholic, politically conservative.
He must have been proud when three of his daughters became Catholic nuns, and at least somewhat doubtful about the fourth’s union with a Bluff Smith.
Oh, to have seen the sparks fly when Dude and Doll met Sister Celine, Sister Marguerita and Sister Theophane!
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Two of the author’s great aunts with their parents, 1927
But then, broad brush strokes don’t paint a complete picture. The differences between the Smiths and the Fords suggest tension, and class and race prejudice certainly characterised the place and the times. But there must also have been a counterbalance of tolerance and goodwill. They couldn’t have survived without it.
Their story was New Zealand’s story, Australia’s too: peoples and cultures coming together, adapting to each other and to a changing world. There were clashes, and they must have had doubts. My grandfather, one generation removed from Bravo, would later write of the modernisation of his beloved Bluff, “one wonders if we are really progressing in our search for what really matters – a simple, better and contented existence”.
Yet they faced what the times and place required, wrote a new chapter in history to set the scene for the present.
Now I’m walking around with an extra piece of personal history since my encounter on that wild, lonely track, and I wonder now why I never looked for it before. I think of the river of successive generations, flowing from the ancestral past into the present, and there’s some comfort in knowing my family has navigated this far."

When it comes to the determinants of health and wellbeing, Aboriginal people draw the short straw every time. On the one hand, high incarceration rates, poor health, disproportionate suicide rates, and low education outcomes are, in many people’s minds, our fault and synonymous with being Aboriginal. On the other hand, if we get too smart and finish school, or go to university, or get a good job, or even live in the city, then we are somehow less Aboriginal, or not Aboriginal, or not Aboriginal at all.
To make matters more complex Aboriginal people are also blamed for the internalised racism that sometimes shows itself as lateral violence, “like mudcrabs in a bucket, pulling each other down”.
I’m no Steve Irwin, but as far as I know mudcrabs belong in mangroves, not in buckets. We need to look closer at the system that puts the crabs in the bucket, and ask why. It’s not an easy task, but until systems actively address colonisation, intergenerational trauma, powerlessness and the ongoing experiences of racism and discrimination that Aboriginal people face daily, we will not see parity of health or other social determinants, so often flung around in Australian gap-closing policy discourse.
It is with this background, and as a mum, community member, trained teacher, and the recently appointed Team Leader for Aboriginal Education at Catholic Education Western Australia (CEWA), I can offer some views on Aboriginal Education.
Truth, justice and reconciliation: an educational approach
As an undergraduate teacher at the University of Notre Dame in Broome, I was lucky enough to be a student of Professor Patrick Dodson. Prof Dodson taught me that reconciliation is a process, a three-part puzzle built on spiritual principles like truth (confession), justice (atonement) and forgiveness (reconciliation). So for me, pushing solely for forgiveness (reconciliation) is not unlike applying a bandaid to a deep cut and ripping it off, reapplying a new one and tearing it off again. The bandaid creates a raw sore that scars, and takes much longer to heal.
Throwing funding at education programs that attempt to “fix the Aboriginal problem” by focusing narrowly on attendance, or correct parenting courses, or one-off scholarships lays blame exclusively with Aboriginal people. It is like saying to Aboriginal families, “If you only made your kids go to school, or knew how to parent properly, or weren’t so poor, then you would succeed. Just try harder”.
I’ve heard school leaders say that “solving the Aboriginal problem” was just a matter of funding: “Give me the dollars and I can get Aboriginal children to school and educate them”.
Comparably, force-feeding school staff with umpteen cultural awareness courses, or raising the Aboriginal flag once a year, or having kids paint coloured hands in the school quad and posting pictures in the school newsletter are also not solutions. As far as I am concerned, educational outcome parity is not solved with deficit-based programs, an open cheque-book, or token Aboriginal events, but rather by doing more with what school communities already have using the three-part puzzle approach.
Truth
An education system that is prepared to examine itself and determine the truth of its readiness and ability to teach Aboriginal students is courageous and innovative, and can achieve two outcomes.
The first is effectively teaching Aboriginal students. The second is ensuring that all students and staff understand Aboriginal histories, languages, spirituality and cultures. At a minimum, school leaders must connect with their system’s Aboriginal Education team to assess their school-wide cultural competency.
The CEWA Aboriginal Education Team has formulated a situational analysis grid that we work on collaboratively with schools to assess their cultural competency. The grid considers the school’s Aboriginal Education Plan, the implementation of the CEWA Aboriginal Education Policy, the teaching of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures, AITSL Australian Professional Standards for Teachers, use of Personalised Learning Plans, adherence to The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Strategy 2015, and the schools engagement with their Aboriginal Teaching Assistants.
It is a process that requires trust, truth and time in order to establish an essential foundation enabling schools to move forward in proving equitable education for Aboriginal students.
Justice
Equality does not always mean justice, as the well-known cartoon depicts:
Once the past has been understood, and the situation of now has been realised, then strength-based, high expectation programs can be implemented. The key to programs like this are consultation and engagement. Here’s a tip about Aboriginal people and a big reason why a plethora of programs fail: we are sick and tired of having things done TO us, rather than WITH us.
Schools must engage with the local Aboriginal community. Every education system has an Aboriginal education department and that deadly squad will have connections to the local school community, along with suggestions for culturally appropriate, strength-based school programs and teaching approaches.
At CEWA schools, Aboriginal Teaching Assistants are essential links to community, not only supporting Aboriginal students, but also fostering school-community engagement and connections. ATAs help teachers implement effective teaching and learning practices and the integration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures in the school curriculum.
In addition to ATAs, affirmative action that increases the number of Aboriginal people on school boards, committees and throughout education systems should be implemented. To affect systemic change, more Aboriginal people need to be employed in leadership roles, and Aboriginal staff need to be spread out across schools and organisations, not just in the “Aboriginal” spaces.
This is an emotional moment for me. We're closing the gap in Indigenous education | Chris Sarra Read more
We need cross-system programs that look beyond Aboriginal people’s “natural sporting ability” as a means of engagement and towards using our culture as a way to develop academic excellence. These programs need to be time-rich and truly academically engaging.
Celebrities wearing cool jumpers, random non-Aboriginal mentors, and a trip to a university once a term does not cut it. In addition, we need more programs that intrinsically motivate Aboriginal girls to succeed in science and math, to become teachers, doctors or engineers, beyond sporting or modeling choices.
We need to deal with attitudes of low-expectations that get many Aboriginal students pushed down non-Atar pathways, because teachers believe students can “get into university via an Aboriginal pathway (bridging course) anyway”.
Education systems must stem the tide of low expectations. The Aspiration Initiative’s Academic Enrichment Program is an example of such a program, which provides community-based, academically-focused support that not only strengthens Aboriginal identity, but also empowers and motivates students to achieve educational success.
Reconciliation
Reconciliation, as part of an educational approach, will only develop with a whole system commitment to addressing unresolved education issues that have stemmed from the colonial hangover.
This commitment requires genuine dialogue. It means teachers, principals, and education system employees at all levels actively learning about our histories, languages, cultures and spirituality, and understanding that racism (both systemic and otherwise) makes Aboriginal people sick.
Reconciliation can only occur after schools and school systems address whiteness and actively move from non-racism to anti-racism. There are many anti-bullying policies, but do school systems have anti-racism policies? Training educators and education staff how to take a stance to become anti-racist will assist to remove the shadow of paternalism, strengthen student ability, and lift teacher and system expectations of students.
A day will come when the word “decolonise” is clearly understood, not as an attack on non-Aboriginal Australians, but as a crucially important process to ensure an equitable education for Aboriginal Australian children, which will benefit everyone.
Reconciliation in the education space requires non-Aboriginal people to share a part of themselves, rather than just the other way around. It is an authentic conversation, a reciprocal relationship based on two-way learning that recognises the power imbalance.
Aboriginal culture is not a problem. The way we talk about it is | IndigenousX Read more
As part of the three-piece puzzle, reconciliation in schools can look like community-run Naidoc week activities, elders engaging in classrooms, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories, languages, cultures and spirituality embedded in the classroom curriculum, reconciliation action plans, Aboriginal language classes, the recognition of Aboriginal English use in classrooms, two-way learning, Sorry Day events and acknowledgement of country at every assembly.
Reconciliation means different things to different people in different contexts. A truth, justice and reconciliation educational approach is one way to look at building a more equitable education system.
It is time to move beyond merely improving the old education model; it’s time for education systems to transform. The opportunity to stop ripping the bandaid off and begin by dealing with the wound is now."

Andrew Tyrie, chair of the influential Commons Treasury select committee, said parliament and the public had been left partly in the dark on the case for a new runway at Heathrow.
He has written to George Osborne calling for more details of the calculations that led an independent commission to recommend the highly controversial addition to the country’s biggest airport.
I’m proud of my daughter and the other brave Heathrow protesters. Here’s why | Tim Sanderson Read more
The Davies commission concluded it was the best of three shortlisted options, which also included extending an existing Heathrow runway and building a new one at Gatwick. In December the government postponed a final decision pending new analysis of the environmental impacts.
In his letter, Tyrie complained that ministers had failed to respond to a series of detailed technical questions tabled in the Commons seeking clarification in areas such as the impact on fares and passenger demand.
He said the commission’s case was “opaque in a number of important respects” and that “a good deal more information is required” if the government’s forthcoming decision is to be properly scrutinised.
The Department for Transport said the commission had provided “exhaustive detail”. “The case for aviation expansion is clear and it’s vitally important we get the decision right so that it will benefit generations to come,” a spokesperson said.
“So we continue to consider the exhaustive detail contained in the Airports Commission’s final report. It has not so far been possible to respond to Mr Tyrie’s long list of questions on related and different issues. However, we are considering his questions in the light of progress and will respond to his letter as soon as possible.”
A spokesman for Gatwick said: “This is a highly significant intervention from the chairman of the Treasury select committee. It is clearly now the consensus view that the Davies report is seriously flawed and not a sound basis for decision-making.”"

Alphabet, parent company of Google, looks set to take the crown from Apple and become the world’s most valuable company.
The tech company announced better than expected results on Monday and gave investors their first proper look under the hood at the engine that drives its business. Operating income from its core businesses rose 23% in 2015. Investors liked what they saw and shares spiked 8% in after-hours trading.
Alphabet closed the trading day valued at $518bn, behind Apple’s $538bn. But if it holds on to that gain once trading begins again Tuesday, it would be worth close to $560bn – the company first broke the half-trillion marker in October.
Wall Street has fretted for years about how much the core Google business was being used to fund founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s ambitions to grow new businesses in robots, self-driving cars and spaceships.
For the first time the company’s core business was broken out from its big-swing “moonshot” projects, allowing investors to see inside the tech giant with a little more clarity, and they like it a lot.
What's in a name? How Alphabet made Google the biggest company in the world Read more
Google segment revenues for 2015 were $74.5bn and it made a profit of $23.4bn. For 2014 Google segment revenues were $65.67bn and profits were just over $19bn. In contrast the “other bets” had revenues of $448m for the 12 months ending 31 December 2015 and lost $3.5bn. In 2014 the moonshots brought in $327m and lost $1.9bn.
Google’s ad revenue – its primary source of income – for the last quarter was $19.08bn, up 17% year-over-year, in the company’s first earnings report as Alphabet.
Market analyst Scott Kessler of S&P Capital IQ said: “It’s nice to see that expenses are being more carefully overseen.” But Kessler still has the stock as a “hold.”
“The company is in the crosshairs of regulators around the world,” Kessler said, pointing to ongoing copyright litigation with Oracle and the company’s investigation by the European Commission over antitrust concerns and rows over tax breaks.
Tories lobbying to protect Google’s £30bn island tax haven Read more
Kessler said the earnings might have resulted in “enthusiasm, even euphoria,” but there were miles to go for Alphabet yet. “There are a lot of legal and regulatory issues that may come to a head this year,” he said.
It is the first time that Alphabet has provided specific numbers for its core business (Google’s search engine, YouTube, Android, Google Play and other units that form the heart of its business) and for the rest of the companies businesses (Google X, its research arm, Calico, its biotech company, Google Fiber, high speed internet, Nest, smart home devices and other bets on future technologies).
Ruth Porat, the company’s chief financial officer, said Alphabet was keeping a close eye on spending. “We remain on a journey, and it is still early days,” she told analysts on a conference call.
Outside of Google, Alphabet’s subsidiaries will each have their own chief executive, reporting to Page. The structure is reportedly modelled after billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which owns a complex portfolio of businesses including clothes manufacturer Fruit of the Loom, insurer Geico and this week bought Precision Castparts, maker of aerospace and other industrial parts.
“Our very strong revenue growth in Q4 reflects the vibrancy of our business, driven by mobile search as well as YouTube and programmatic advertising, all areas in which we’ve been investing for many years. We’re excited about the opportunities we have across Google and Other Bets to use technology to improve the lives of billions of people,” Porat said."

There’s been much vilification of lawyers and repeated calls for overseas troops to be exempt from its protection.
In all those column inches, there’s one group we’ve not heard from – the many servicemen and women and their families who have used the act to seek justice when the Ministry of Defence has failed to meet the standards they rightly expect and deserve.
Military chiefs lead charge against Human Rights Act Read more
I am one of them. Today, 20 years after my daughter Cheryl died, the inquest into her death will begin – and my family would not have seen this day without the Human Rights Act. It secured us access to vital evidence regarding Cheryl’s death – evidence it suited the authorities to withhold, to which I was repeatedly refused access and without which my legal team at Liberty could not have secured this fresh inquest.
Cheryl was found dead from a gunshot wound to the face while undergoing initial training at Deepcut barracks in 1995. She was just 18. We expected “things” would be done properly. After all, this was the British army – no stone unturned and all that. I was a child of the 50s and trusted the establishment implicitly: the army, the government, and obviously the police. I was their friend; they were mine.
Reality was very different. Surrey police immediately handed the matter over to the army. The army didn’t even wait for the inquest before documenting Cheryl’s death as suicide. The Royal Military police investigation and original inquest were vastly inadequate – witnesses weren’t called, medical records went uninspected and evidence was ignored. The coroner recorded an open verdict. It was all so hurried and uncaring and, crucially, left so many questions unanswered.
We expected ‘things' would be done properly. After all, this was the British army – no stone unturned and all that
It would be seven years before we established that there was no forensic evidence that Cheryl’s death was caused by the rifle found at her side.
In March 2002, James Collinson became the fourth Deepcut recruit found dead from gunshot wounds – and it was the media that started asking questions. Not the army, and not even the government.
Surrey police immediately “reopened” investigations. I have little doubt that had the deaths happened at, say, Eton or Oxford University, a public inquiry would have been a formality. However, it became clear to me that this was little more than a cursory re-examination of assumed suicide, more intended to appease public opinion than to discover what really happened. It was rushed, and everything felt wrong.
The government finally shut down press speculation and public criticism by appointing Nicholas Blake QC to review Surrey police’s evidence. Neither the families, nor our legal representatives, were granted unrestricted access to any of that evidence.

It came as no surprise that Blake published 33 recommendations – though it was a shock that his 34th was to recommend no public inquiry. It was an even bigger shock when Surrey police ignored another Blake recommendation – to share the evidence regarding Cheryl’s death with us, her family. Their refusal was to last for almost a decade.
In 2011, my wife and I came to Liberty. They threatened Surrey police with legal action under – guess what? – the Human Rights Act, which demands proper, effective investigations into deaths involving the state. Only then did they agree to hand over what we had fought for: more than 90 lever-arch files of forensic evidence, statements, photographs and notes. That evidence let Liberty apply for fresh inquest.
And so we come to today, when we are on the brink of exposing answers the authorities have fought so long to keep under lock and key. The original inquest lasted just one hour. This inquest will probably last for two months, with evidence from more than 100 witnesses.
Given what my family has been through, you’ll forgive me if I am distrustful of this government’s motivations in repealing or diluting the Human Rights Act. You will understand why I am wary of any plan for a replacement that will leave the rights of overseas troops unprotected and let politicians choose which cases are serious enough to merit their day in court.
You will appreciate why even the glossiest public relations offensive will not convince me that abolishing the act would be a good thing for members of our armed forces.

Mine is just one case, but it’s far from the only one. There are the families of the soldiers who died in unprotected Snatch Land Rovers, told by our supreme court that they can use the Human Rights Act to challenge the MoD.
There are the families of the soldiers who died of heat exhaustion on the Brecon Beacons last year, who only secured a full inquest examining the wider failings of the army after using the act. There are the sisters of Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement, only able to secure a fresh inquest into her death and a fresh investigation of her rape allegation by using the Act.
And there are the families of the three other young soldiers who died at Deepcut – all of whom are battling to secure thorough investigations.
The establishment don’t like being challenged – but they must understand that they sometimes get things wrong. We cannot allow politicians to repeal legislation that has proved so valuable to so many, simply because it does not accommodate the ideology of a government that could not get its own way.
My message to the prime minister, the defence and justice secretaries and the minister for human rights is a very simple one: if you’d like to hear firsthand how the Human Rights Act helps our troops, I would be delighted to oblige.

The Guardian|Open door|National newspapers|Newspapers & magazines|Newspapers|comment,2016-02-01T07:00:22,guardian,Chris Elliott,Open door: Articles that have – in one way or another – been paid for by advertisers are a important part of a newspaper’s revenue stream. But it is vital for readers that the status of the article is clearly marked,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/the-importance-of-clear-labelling-when-it-comes-to-branded-content,The importance of clear labelling when it comes to branded content,en,opinion,,"It has been said before but bears repeating – journalism costs money. Captain John Edward Taylor knew that when he produced the first Manchester Guardian on 5 May 1821 with advertisements on the front page. Since then a mix of advertising and cover price has paid for the journalism between the covers of newspapers. One of the elements of advertising revenue is what was once known as the advertisement feature: an article that – in one way or another – has been paid for by advertisers. They have varying amounts of control according to the deal.
As aspects of the traditional business model of newspapers are hollowed out by the social and cultural changes wrought by technology, there is a greater emphasis on what is now known as branded content. This content is responsible for around 10% of Guardian revenues. It is important for both advertisers and readers alike that the status of the article is clearly marked.
Last Monday, 25 January, the existing three ways to label branded content were redrawn and there are now two. The “sponsored by” label was replaced with “supported by”. As the guidelines on commercial content spell out: “‘Supported by’ is used to describe editorially independent content. The Guardian accepts funding from third parties both for new projects and for content we are already producing. Before funding is agreed with a client, relevant senior editors are consulted about its suitability and the editor-in-chief has the final say on whether a funding deal is accepted.
A client whose branding appears on editorial content may have a role in suggesting what kind of topics are covered, but the commissioning editor is not obliged to accept ideas from the funder. The content is written and edited by Guardian and Observer journalists, or those approved by GNM, to the same standards expected in all of our journalism. GNM will not show copy to funders for approval.
“‘Supported by’ is also used to describe editorially independent content that the Guardian has produced with funding from foundations around the world, which support specific projects. Examples of foundation funding include: a grant from The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to help support the Guardian’s Global Development site; and a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to support the Guardian’s Cities project.
“‘Brought to you by’ is being replaced by ‘Paid content/paid for by’. The guidelines say: “‘Paid content/paid for by’ is used to describe advertisement features that are paid for and controlled by the advertiser rather than the publisher and are subject to regulation by the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK, the Federal Trade Commission in the US and the Advertising Standards Bureau in Australia. This content is produced by commercial departments and does not involve GNM staff journalists.”
There is a clue in that last one as to one of the main reasons behind the change, which is for the sake of clarity. The Guardian is a global brand and in the US labelling content “brought to you by” is widely thought to mean the content is editorially independent rather than under the control of the advertiser.
Branded content is created by the Guardian Labs team, whose managing director, Anna Watkins, has said publicly that she would like to see the ASA issue some standard advice to create a level playing field among newspapers and websites.
The presence of branded content in the newspaper and on our website is not without occasional controversy. The readers’ editor’s office sometimes receives complaints from readers, either singly or in groups, about it. The most recent has been a campaign aimed at a partnership with Shell. We have received 13 queries, all on similar lines. One person wrote: “The pressure group 38 Degrees says that the Guardian is receiving money from the Shell oil company and in return the latter is having a say in deciding which articles or news reports are featured in the newspaper. If true, this revelation is most disconcerting since only a few months ago the Guardian embarked on a campaign to urge a number of entities to withdraw their financial investments in companies that trade in fossil fuels.”
A Guardian spokesman said: “Shell and the community jobs site Working Mums are co-sponsoring the Guardian’s Work/Life balance hub on our Women in Leadership network. The hub is focused on how working parents can use flexible working culture to manage both their job and their home life.”
In line with the new labelling guidelines, editorially independent content, in which Shell/Working Mums have no input, is now labelled “supported by”; advertisement features, in which the content is controlled by Shell/Working Mums, are labelled “paid for by”. The Guardian’s spokesman makes a fair point: “The acceptance of advertising or partnership content in no way affects our editorial position. We are free to, and often do, challenge the activities of companies and organisations that are also our advertisers and sponsors.”
The Guardian stated at the time of the launch of phase II of the newspaper’s Keep it in the Ground campaign that it would continue to take fossil fuel advertising. In the light of that decision, the important thing is that we make it very clear when content is paid for, and I think the new labelling is unambiguous and therefore effective."

It’s simple: you go to Oxford or Cambridge. Look at the prime minister. He knows that his route to success was made radically easier by a few formative years in the company of other future pillars of the establishment at one of our two most storied universities. And so, quite reasonably, he wants to make the availability of that experience less elitist, more meritocratic. That, according to his article in the Sunday Times yesterday, is a big part of how we’ll fix the problems of racial inequality in Britain: getting more black kids into Oxford.
University of Oxford rebuts Cameron's claims over student diversity Read more
The sad irony is, in offering that solution and providing some quite reasonable ideas for how to go about it, David Cameron is reinforcing a more basic problem. Yes, it’s true that the establishment’s sense of Oxbridge as the ultimate arbiter of ability means that racial inequality in those institutions is an issue. But there’s a simpler solution: stop obsessing about Oxbridge.
Only 1% of all British undergraduates attend those universities, and only about 1% of that 1% are black: in the circumstances, it seems a bit preposterous to think that this is where you’re going to make the greatest impact. Instead of perpetuating the idea that only these institutions count, you might pause momentarily to consider the impact of the removal of the educational maintenance allowance, and then think that perhaps it would make more sense to laud the achievements of the 60% of black students who attend a group of 30 rather less feted or well-funded institutions, none of which have found themselves at the centre of a row about Cecil Rhodes.
In response to the PM’s calls for change to legislation, Oxford said that it “does not see the need” – a crashingly ill-judged and dismissive phrase that only highlights the error of our Oxbridge preoccupation. Still, if we must dwell on the dreaming spires, be in no doubt: whatever vast problems there are earlier on in the food chain, however important early years interventions and secondary education might be, Oxford is certainly failing.
Minority students with three As at A level are less likely to apply to Oxford than their white peers
The university chooses to boast about the large percentage boost in the number of black students it admitted from one year to the next, but big percentage jumps in tiny numbers are easy: there might be 60% more black students than there were in 2010, but that still only means 64 out of 2,500. (There was a whopping 400% increase in black Caribbean admissions from 2012 to 2013, too: from one such student to five. Hooray!)
And even as it bemoans the shortage of qualified black and other ethnic-minority applicants, it stays pretty quiet about a completely damning fact: in 2013 it was reported that minority students with three As at A-level are actually less likely to apply to Oxford than their white peers. You can’t blame the teachers for that one.
That’s bad for Oxford, which is a worse university for every one of its students by dint of its thudding uniformity. The rest of us should, perhaps, pay attention to those ethnic-minority students with three As who choose to study elsewhere. They can see that there might be more meaningful measures of achievement than going to the same university as the prime minister. However laudable his intentions, it’s a pity that the prime minister can’t see the same."

This year the 50-year agreement between those nations, which forbade us from living in our homeland, expires. The UK government says they are considering whether it will let us go back. I hope it will finally, but we’ve had these hopes snatched away so many times before.

Life in Mauritius was hard – we lived in a slum and were looked down on by local people because we had nothing. Although I was a good student and passed the necessary exams, my parents didn’t have the money to send me to college so I worked in a packing factory for many years. Eventually I got some training to work in restaurants because I love to cook.
By that time my husband and I had four children: the youngest was four and the oldest 12. When I was given the chance to move to England with a group of other Chagossians, I had to take the opportunity as it was the only chance for a better life for all of us – for our future.
When we arrived, we had nowhere to go so we stayed at Gatwick airport for a week sleeping on chairs or the floor and surviving on donations from other travellers. Then we were taken by a Chagossian to Crawley, where we stayed in temporary accommodation while we looked for work. But with no fixed address it was very hard to find a job.

After six months, 12 of the group finally found some more permanent shared accommodation. I got a cleaning job at Gatwick – where I had once slept! I worked as hard as I could, taking overtime shifts so that I could save money to bring my family over.
Eventually, and after borrowing additional money from friends, I was able to pay for the visas and airfares for my husband and children. We stayed at first at friends’ houses until we could pay for a private rental of our own. My husband got a few hours’ worth of work as a hospital cleaner, while I cleaned at the airport and friends helped look after the children.
There were more years like this – working and saving – until I could bring my parents over because my father was not well. Then my husband got a full time cleaner’s job so I could stay with the children and take a food hygiene course to pursue my dream.
We had to apply and pay for visas and papers three times: first for the two-year visa, then for the indefinite visa, then for British citizenship. Such a lot of money and difficulty for us Chagossians who are forced exiles – not refugees or immigrants. And most of us are on the minimum wage. My stepsister has not been able to get a British passport so she has not been able to join us here to this day, even when my father passed away.
We had to apply and pay for visas three times: for the two-year visa, then the indefinite visa, then for citizenship
So many Chagossians in the UK have had their families divided by these rules, and for us family is everything. Or should I say family and our islands, because for all of us here – whether younger or older generation – we will not give up our right to return to our Chagos home. My father’s dying wish was to die in his birthplace. It breaks my heart that he said to me: “Burn me and put my ashes in the sea so they will go back to Diego Garcia one day.”
These days I help with the groups we run for Chagossian women, children and the elderly. We support each other with literacy, filling out forms, helping families settle here. We organise events and get-togethers. It is important that our community stays strong and celebrates its culture: we have lost so much, but not that.
Once the UK government says “You can go home”, my family will go back to the Chagos Islands the very next day. We will fight until that happens and await with eagerness the supreme court ruling, which is expected this month.
Our lives have seen such discrimination and hardship – first in Mauritius and now the UK. How can you take away people’s homeland and then treat them like this? Why does the government make it so hard for us to live here when we are British citizens? They should at least help us until we get our right to return home to our islands. And we will."
Monarchy|Opinion|Prince Charles|Prince Charles letters|Art|Painting|Drawing|comment,2016-02-01T15:36:39,guardian,Jonathan Jones,"He grew up surrounded by art, and his work isn’t awful – just amateur. But the poor man has to do something with his time",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/prince-charles-paintings-millions-art-charity-monarchy,Prince Charles’s paintings are notching up millions. That doesn’t make them any good,en,opinion,,"There was an emperor of China who spent so much time painting that he lost his throne. Let’s hope that never happens to our own Prince Charles. The Emperor Huizong, who died in 1135, was a gifted painter as well as a calligrapher and poet. He made a major contribution to the cultural golden age of the Song dynasty – but his fascination with beauty distracted him from military affairs and his kingdom was invaded. He died a prisoner.
A constitutional monarch in the 21st century has far less military responsibility than a Chinese emperor in the 12th. Much as he may wish to influence our government with his “black spider” letters, Charles will never have to make a personal decision about renewing Trident, going to war, or even renationalising the railways. He can paint all he likes without endangering the kingdom.

So paint he does, and now it turns out he has earned good money from it. Since 1992, sales of Prince Charles’s watercolours have raised £2m for the Prince of Wales’s charitable foundation. This does not make him, as has been reported, “one of Britain’s most successful living artists” – £2m since 1997 hardly puts him in the Hirst or Hockney league financially – but it does show that a good number of people think his art is good enough to own. Are they right? Is it time we took the heir to the throne more seriously as an artist?
There is an ancient relationship between monarchy and art. Rulers have traditionally been the greatest of patrons, hiring artists to work at their courts, commissioning mighty murals and fine statues, and buying up masterpieces. The prince grew up among the fruits of royal art patronage going back many centuries. The Royal Collection includes paintings by Rembrandt, Artemisia Gentileschi, Holbein, Vermeer, Lorenzo Lotto and Caravaggio, yet these are arguably eclipsed by the holdings of the Royal Library in Windsor Castle that include the finest collection of Leonardo da Vinci’s drawings on earth.

It must help you to feel familiar with art if you see a Rembrandt in the lounge every day
Did growing up surrounded by all that art give Charles a talent of his own? Has the genius of Leonardo passed by some kind of osmosis into the blood of the Windsors? For the prince is not the only artist in the family: Prince William studied art history, while Prince Harry is a dab hand with a camera and has decided views on photography, strongly expressing his disdain for the selfie.
Gallerist Anna Hunter, who has helped Charles to sell his art, claims his watercolours “are a really good reflection of the talent that lies within the royal family for art”. It’s hard to see that talent in Charles’s watercolours. They are not awful. They are merely ordinary – and obviously amateur. He looks like what he is, a hobby artist. His pictures are nice efforts but no one would think they were worth putting on the market if they did not have his name attached. You’d have to be a very strong royalist indeed to pay out for one.
Charles has the confidence to make art. It must help you to feel familiar with art if you see a Rembrandt in the lounge every day. Yet sadly, the modern royal family are effectively forbidden from expressing their regal familiarity with art in the way traditionally open to monarchs.

When Charles sells his watercolours for charity we applaud. But what would happen if he used the money instead to buy a Damien Hirst for the Royal Collection? It would be a national scandal. For the royals today to spend lavish sums of money collecting art – to bid for Freuds and Picassos – would be seen as a disgraceful waste of money, a plutocratic slap in the face. Yet collecting art is precisely what monarchs traditionally did, and it’s the reason the present royals have inherited so much of it.
The best (and worst) royal portraits - in pictures Read more
It was not just the Emperor Huizong who lost a kingdom by becoming an artist. In western history, the ruler who indulges a supposed artistic talent is an image of tyranny, even insanity. The Roman emperor Nero sang his own poetry and reputedly “fiddled while Rome burned” – his creative pretensions just monstrous proof of a deranged and cruel ruler. Henry VIII of England, another tyrant who despoiled monasteries and callously had wives and ministers executed, also wrote his own songs. The image of the “creative” tyrant holds true in modern history as well: Hitler was famously a would-be artist. In his very last days in his Berlin bunker he was still planning mad architectural visions.
If Charles had any real power, perhaps we would worry about him being “one of Britain’s most successful living artists”. We might see his apparent need to be taken seriously as an artist as a sign of a tyrant in the making. As it is, he is a caged bird. And birds can sing.
The debate on monarchy, such as it exists, is misguided. Republicans get angry as if the royalist myth of the British monarchy were actually true: as if we really were ruled by queens and kings. In reality, the monarchy is an enfeebled caricature of its former self. That’s why nobody minds if Charles goes off into the mountains with his watercolours - the poor man has to do something with his time. If he can raise money for charity into the bargain, great. But if he ever tried to have a ceiling painted by a modern-day Rubens he would suddenly discover how small his powers really are."

Thanks to everyone who sent in responses. Many were correct, and they saved me the bother of drawing a solution myself...
My favourite design was the Room of Shadows sent in by Liam Roberts. Extra marks for the oriental rug, toilet, kitchenette, bedroom, and is that a wing for playing chess?

I’m not sure there is any obvious way of solving this apart from doodling on a piece of paper and then realising that you will need to have a room that has ‘spikes’ sticking out from a main section. The simplest solution uses only six line segments, and is based on a triangle. It looks like a three-pronged shuriken.

The eruption of Australia’s tallest mountain has been captured in a rare video.
While most people might have thought Mount Kosciuszko was Australia’s highest peak, Mawson Peak – a mountain on Heard Island, an Australian territory 4,100km south-west of Perth in the Southern Indian Ocean – actually towers over it.
It was captured on video spewing gas and vapour from its 2,745m peak located on the volcanic massif Big Ben and lava was seen flowing down the side. Although it is thought to have erupted three or more times since 2000, the island is so remote eruptions were usually inferred from satellite images.
Prof Mike Coffin from the University of Tasmania’s Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies said seeing the eruption was a surprise, describing it as “an amazing coda to this week’s submarine research”.
Scientists aboard the CSIRO’s research vessel Investigator were circling Heard Island and the nearby McDonald Islands, mapping the surrounding seafloor for the first time.
“We have 10 excited geoscientists aboard Investigator and our enthusiasm has spread to our 50 shipmates,” Coffin said.
The aim was to study the link between underwater volcanoes and the amount of iron in the ocean, which supports most marine life.
• Mawson Peak was incorrectly named as the highest mountain in an Australian state or territory. Mount McClintock, in Australian Antarctic Territory, is actually the highest at 3,492m. This has now been corrected."
Embryos|Genetics|Ethics|Biology|Health|Medical research|news,2016-02-01T13:12:19,guardian,Haroon Siddique,"Scientists investigating miscarriage will not be able to implant embryos or study them for more than two weeks, says HFEA",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/01/human-embryo-genetic-modify-regulator-green-light-research,British researchers get green light to genetically modify human embryos,en,science,,"Scientists investigating miscarriage will not be able to implant embryos or study them for more than two weeks, says HFEA
Britain’s first genetically modified human embryos could be created within months, after scientists were granted permission by the fertility regulator to carry out the procedure.
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) regulator approved a licence application by Kathy Niakan, a stem cell scientist at the Francis Crick Institute in London, to perform so-called genome editing – also called gene editing – on human embryos.
The decision permits Niakan to study the embryos for 14 days for research purposes only. It does not permit them to be implanted into women. Niakan’s research is aimed at finding the genes at play in the early days of human fertilisation.

The decision was greeted positively by the Francis Crick Institute and British scientists but was met with anger and disqmay by those concerned that rapid advances in the field of genome editing is precluding proper consideration of the ethical implications.
Paul Nurse, director of the institute, said: “I am delighted that the HFEA has approved Dr Niakan’s application. Dr Niakan’s proposed research is important for understanding how a healthy human embryo develops and will enhance our understanding of IVF success rates, by looking at the very earliest stage of human development – one to seven days.”
The work, using embryos donated by couples with a surplus after IVF treatment, will look at the fertilised egg’s development from a single cell to about 250 cells. The basic research could help scientists understand why some women lose their babies before term and provide better clinical treatments for infertility, using conventional medical methods.
Niakan will use a powerful genome editing procedure called Crispr-Cas9 to switch genes on and off in early stage human embryos. She will then look for the effects the modifications have on the development of the cells that go on to form the placenta.
Crispr-Cas9 has revolutionised biomedical research since its invention three years ago. It allows scientists to make precise changes to DNA, and has the potential to transform the treatment of genetic disorders by correcting faulty genes.
Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, group leader at the Francis Crick Institute, said: “
The approval of her [Niakan’s] licence gives the exciting prospect that we will at last begin to understand how the different cell types are specified at these pre-implantation stages in the human embryo.”
Lovell-Badge said it would also provide invaluable information about the accuracy and efficiency of the technique, helping to inform the debate about whether genome editing could be used in future to correct faulty genes that cause devastating diseases.
That prospect remains a long way off but is already a subject of concern.
Dr David King, director of Human Genetics Alert, said: “This is the first step in a well mapped-out process leading to GM babies, and a future of consumer eugenics.” He claimed the government’s scientific advisers had already decided they were comfortable with the prospect of so-called “designer babies”.
Anne Scanlan, from the anti-abortion organisation Life, said: “The HFEA now has the reputation of being the first regulator in the world to approve this uncertain and dangerous technology. It has ignored the warnings of over 100 scientists worldwide and given permission for a procedure that could have damaging far-reaching implications for human beings.”
There are fears that changes to an embryo’s DNA could have unknown harmful consequences throughout a person’s body and be passed on down the generations.
Last year, leading UK funders called for a national debate on whether editing human embryos could ever be justified in the clinic. Some fear that a public backlash could derail less controversial uses of genome editing, which could lead to radical new treatments for conditions such as muscular dystrophy and sickle cell disease.
The US National Institutes of Health will not fund any genome editing research on human embryos at present.

But supporters of the HFEA’s decision said it had arrived at the right conclusion, balancing the benefits to research and ethical considerations.
“The ruling by the HFEA is a triumph for common sense,” said Darren Griffin, a professor of genetics at the University of Kent. “While it is certain that the prospect of gene editing in human embryos raised a series of ethical issues and challenges, the problem has been dealt with in a balanced manner. It is clear that the potential benefits of the work proposed far outweigh the foreseen risks.”
Sarah Norcross, director of Progress Educational Trust, called it “a victory for level-headed regulation over moral panic”.
Dr Sarah Chan, chancellor’s fellow at Usher Institute for Population Health Sciences and Informatics, University of Edinburgh, said: “We should feel confident that our regulatory system in this area is functioning well to keep science aligned with social interests.”"

Space|From the Guardian archive|Nasa|Animals|Astronomy,2016-02-01T05:30:19,guardian,,"The Guardian, 1 February 1961: Ham the chimpanzee, part of Nasa’s programme to put a man in space, flew 155 miles up in the Mercury capsule",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/01/nasa-space-programme-chimpanzee-1961-archive,Space chimpanzee alive and well,en,science,,"1 February 1961: Ham the chimpanzee, part of Nasa’s programme to put a man in space, flew 155 miles up in the Mercury capsule
Cape Canaveral, January 31.
A chimpanzee named Ham, fired into space by United States scientists today in a rehearsal for the American man-in-space project, went higher, farther, and faster than planned, but was picked up from the sea alive and in good condition.
The nine-foot-high Mercury capsule, mounted in a Redstone rocket, carried the chimpanzee in a form-fitting fibre-glass couch 40 miles higher than expected - to 155 miles. It landed about 420 miles down range instead of 290 miles, and travelled at 5,000 m.p.h. instead of 4,000 m.p.h. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said this was because of “higher than usual booster thrust.”
After being taken out of the capsule, Ham promptly shook hands with the veterinary surgeon and was then taken to the sick bay for preliminary examination. He will be brought to Cape Canaveral for still further tests some time late tomorrow.
“Performed satisfactorily”
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said instruments showed that the chimpanzee “performed satisfactorily during the flight.”
Six of the seven astronauts were here to watch and help in today’s up and down flight, which one of them may make as early as April if careful physical and mental checks on the monkey and all technical aspects show the flight to be a complete success.
The chimpanzee entered the capsule after an exhaustive physical examination; he was chosen last night as the physically and psychologically best fitted of the six monkeys here. A NASA spokesman said chimpanzees were chosen because “their high intelligence and docility make them outstanding performers in the conduct of complex tasks in restricted situations.”
Photographers had a brief glimpse of Ham after his physical examination and before he was strapped into his pressurised suit and couch. He seemed quite cheerful and at ease and screeched at them a few times when flashlights went off too near his face.

Police escort
Then he was driven in a big white van with a police escort to be placed in the capsule waiting on top of a Redstone rocket. After all electrical connections had been made, the steel hatch of the capsule slammed shut on the chimpanzee.
For the last 24 hours the chimpanzee has been on a special diet, including baby food, which is low in water content. But just in case of accidents, he wore a regular baby’s napkin under his space suit.
Before the flight the chimpanzee was known simply as No. 65, but immediately it was known that he had survived, NASA announced that his nickname was “Ham.” It had kept the name secret previously for fear that it would “humanise” the attempt. He got his name “from the way he hammed it up as we put him in the capsule.”
Captain L. Gordon Cooper, one of the astronauts who observed the flight from the control blockhouse, said: “I am certainly very happy about the shot. Nothing succeeds like success.” And Dr Robert Gilruth, director of NASA’s “space task group,” said: “We regard it as a successful test. We feel we have got a lot of very valuable information.”"

Science|Across the universe|Astronomy|Space|Stephen Hawking|blogposts,2016-02-01T13:35:13,guardian,Stuart Clark,Stephen Hawking has chosen black holes as the subject of his BBC Reith Lectures. Here’s why these mysterious objects remain at the forefront of astronomers’ attention,https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/feb/01/what-is-a-black-hole-stephen-hawking-reith-lectures,What is a black hole?,en,science,,"Stephen Hawking has chosen black holes as the subject of his BBC Reith Lectures . Here’s why these mysterious objects remain at the forefront of astronomers’ attention
Black holes are places of mystery. The laws of physics predict their existence but cannot explain what happens inside a black hole. Once we can do that, we will have stepped beyond the work of Albert Einstein and taken the next big leap in our understanding of the Universe.
Put simply, black holes are places where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape once it gets too close. This sets them apart from all other celestial objects, where you would always – in principle – be able to build a rocket strong enough to escape into space.
With a black hole, it would take an infinite amount of energy to pull away.

The boundary of no return is called the event horizon. Once across this invisible threshold you will be in the black hole’s clutches forever. It’s the celestial equivalent of a lobster pot – easy to get into but impossible to leave.
The concept of a black hole follows naturally from Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, published in 1915. It states that the strength of a celestial object’s gravitational field is determined by the density of matter it contains: the higher the density, the stronger the gravity.
The dilemma is where does this process stop? In a black hole, there is nothing known that can resist the overwhelming gravity, and we are forced to believe that the matter is simply crushed out of existence.
This is a dramatic way of describing a mathematical object called a singularity, a point of zero volume and infinite density. But physicists are unsure that such objects can exist in reality. It just sounds impossible.
Theories of quantum gravity are designed to tackle this problem and tell us how gravity behaves on the smallest possible scales, and at the great possible strengths and densities of matter. There are a number of approaches being taken, including the often mentioned string theory, but at present there is no strong front-runner.
A successful quantum gravity theory would not only allow astronomers to study the interior of a black hole, it would also tell us about the big bang, the origin of the universe. This is because the big bang is another place in nature where relativity predicts a singularity will appear.
In short, a quantum theory of gravity could tell us how the Universe came into existence in the first place, and that’s way astronomers are still so interested in black holes.

Refugees|Migration|Calais|France|Kurds|Europe,2016-01-31T22:00:09,guardian,Patrick Kingsley|John Domokos|Nazia Parveen,"In a tent city in France, two men with UK passports are prevented from coming home with their wives and children",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/31/migrants-dunkirk-british-citizens-france-tent-city-iraqi-kurds-uk-passports,British citizens living alongside their families in squalor of Dunkirk,en,world|europe,,"In a tent city in France, two men with UK passports are prevented from coming home with their wives and children
In a ditch near Rawand Aziz’s tent in northern France, a dead rat lies in the dirt. Outside the tent-flap, the rain has turned the ground into a churn of liquid mud. Inside, Aziz’s baby son Oscar coughs and cries. At night, the temperature can drop below freezing, so Oscar, like many of the 1,500 people living in this field, is constantly ill.
The most shocking thing about Calais is that it’s not even too big to solve | Yvette Cooper Read more
This is the tent city at Dunkirk, a spillover refugee camp 20 miles east of the bigger and better-known site at Calais. The routine is similar – just as in Calais people rush the trains to try to make it to Britain, here they aim for the ships. But the conditions are even worse . Not just worse than Calais, aid workers report, but also than camps in the middle of war zones. It is not a place that anyone would come to by choice.
But Aziz is not just anyone. If he wanted he could reach Dover tonight, perfectly legally. He rummages in his bags and plucks out a maroon booklet. It’s a British passport.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest British citizen Rawand Aziz with his son Oscar at the camp. Photograph: John Domokos for the Guardian
“I’m British,” Aziz says, in an accent that blends a northern brogue with a Kurdish lilt. “I became British. I know about the culture, the country, the law – everything about Britain.”
If we don’t arrive in the UK, probably I’ll lose my child Rawand Aziz
David Cameron called people like Aziz “a bunch of migrants”, unwanted travellers camped here at the gateway to Britain. But the truth is often more complex, with many refugees at Dunkirk prioritising the UK over other parts of Europe because of family ties to the country.
Aziz is an extreme example of this complexity, one of at least two naturalised British citizens who have chosen to live in one of Europe’s only shanty towns because family members have been denied entry to the UK.
The 35-year-old moved here to join his wife, Hataw, and son Oscar, since neither has been granted a British passport.
A few tents away, Saman Sharif, 31, is living with his wife, Shukry, and their four children. Both men are Iraqi Kurds who fled the oppression of Saddam Hussein before the 2003 war. They reached Britain via Calais, and were later granted asylum and then British citizenship.
Neither provide a shining example of a flawless integration system; after more than a decade each in the UK, neither speaks anything approaching perfect English, and Aziz never found permanent work. But their cases lay raw the arbitrary nature of UK border policy – which has forced two British nationals to camp in squalor in France so that they can live alongside their children.
For Aziz, the irony is particularly obvious – he gave Oscar an English name in homage to British values. He decided against an Islamic name in an attempt to distance himself from the Middle East. “I didn’t want my child to copy this life,” Aziz explains. “British name, British culture, British education – everything he gets is British. We are Muslims, but we are fed up with Muslims.”
Aziz remembers the moment he finally won British citizenship in 2009. “I [felt]: I am a human, I have somebody who supports me, and supports my life – I felt at that time I was safe.” Six years on, he adds, “it’s still the same emotion – but for my family, it’s different.”
Hints of Britain are sprinkled almost tauntingly across the camp. A poster of a Tom Hiddleston film is an incongruous addition to a nearby tent. The main dirt track has been named Queen Elizabeth II Street. Someone’s daubed Liverpool FC’s anthem over one of the few walls in the tent city: You’ll Never Walk Alone.
The irony is that for the residents of the camp, the reverse is true. They are on their own – never more so than when the Aziz family arrived at the camp in the pouring rain last October. They had been walking for miles, and by the time they arrived, Oscar seemed to have stopped breathing, Aziz says. Doctors revived him, but Aziz lives in fear of a repeat.
“He’s very ill. If we don’t arrive in the UK, probably I’ll lose my child,” he says. “The condition is very freezing, very cold. He’s not strong enough for that situation.”
This is the latest challenge in Aziz’s quest for a stable British life. When he himself first arrived in Britain, his asylum application was initially rejected. He eventually won an appeal in 2007, but life was never easy. He says he studied English and maths at college in Salford, but never found permanent work. He did odd jobs as a cleaner, and worked for a cleaning agency, earning £4 an hour. But stability was hard to come by.
Aziz was granted citizenship in 2009 – a second birth, he says – but when life in Iraqi Kurdistan calmed down, he returned home after a decade away. There he met Hataw, 27, and joined the peshmerga’s fight against Islamic State. By a quirk of fate, he was part of a peshmerga delegation that received British defence minister Michael Fallon in 2015, and an online video shows him briefly at Fallon’s shoulder. But then, he says, his family was threatened by militants, leading him to look for an exit strategy.

Flying to England was not an option – Aziz does not earn enough for his spouse to qualify for a visa. So last autumn he took Hataw and Oscar to Turkey instead. From there, they sailed to the Greek islands, and made their way to this camp in northern France. They’re still a long way from safety; this week a gunfight between alleged smugglers created a sense of deja vu for those campers who have fled from war.
Saman Sharif’s story is also complex, another reminder that the refugee crisis often defies easy explanations. He also fled Hussein’s Iraq, but unlike Aziz, he says he gained asylum in Britain within weeks in 2002.
Since Sharif was already married, he would leave Britain every so often, flying to the Kurdish areas of Syria and Iran to meet his wife and growing number of children in a safer third country. He lived in Birmingham, and worked for eight years in a food factory in Evesham – but his English is still halting.
One friend in Birmingham remembers him as a hard worker. “I have known Sharif for many years and he is just trying to make a better life for his family,” the friend said. “We always see him for only little time because he is working or going to France. We hope that something good will happen for him soon.”
Sharif won citizenship in 2007 – and ever since he has tried time and again to bring his family to Britain. But like Aziz, his earnings as a manual labourer are too low to allow him to bring them legally.
“Fourteen years I’ve been trying,” Sharif sighs. “There’s no chance – 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013 – four times I’ve applied to bring my wife … But no chance.”
Unlike Aziz, Sharif says he had no inkling that his family was coming to Europe. Living in Kirkuk, in southern Kurdistan, Shukry Sharif had feared that Isis might eventually take the city. So she and the children left in secret without telling Sharif, arriving in Germany last autumn.
Sharif joined his family at Dunkirk, where the campers are predominantly Kurdish, and commutes between Britain and France so that he can look for work. But the chaotic nature of his split life means that he can’t hold down a job and is running out of savings.
“It’s not good for me,” Sharif says. Sometimes I’m here, sometimes I’m in the UK, so I can’t work. Now I have to get my family to send me money from Iraq.”
Jeremy Corbyn urges UK to join EU efforts to tackle refugee crisis Read more
The plight of the Aziz and Sharif families has drawn the attention of Jeremy Corbyn, who is said to have promised to look into their cases during a visit to Dunkirk last week. Britain’s Refugee Council has also condemned their situation, and advised the families to apply for asylum in France and then request a transfer to the UK.
Lisa Doyle, the Refugee Council’s head of advocacy, said: “It’s utterly appalling to hear that the families of British citizens who are fleeing the murderous advance of Isis are being prevented from coming to live in safety with their husbands here in Britain.
“The British government must ensure that refugees with loved ones in Britain are able to travel safely and legally to join them, rather than leaving them to dice with death on the Mediterranean Sea and then languish in despair in Dunkirk.”
Attempting to escape that despair, Hataw Aziz and Shukry Sharif often take their youngest children for a walk around Dunkirk in a pair of donated buggies. With a row of suburban French houses lying just beyond the camp entrance, Citroëns in the driveway, the two women could be a pair of French residents off on an afternoon stroll.
But then their prams begin to jam, offering a reminder of their predicament. Still inside the dirt of the camp, the wheels have got stuck in the mud."

Female role models and the status of science jobs also play a key role
Women are notoriously under-represented in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are male tech pioneers who trip off the tongue, while a measly 26% of computing jobs in the US are held by women. But that’s not the full story – pick a slice of the sector from across the globe and you will see women carving a space for themselves.
The experience of women varies by country and the wealth or liberalism of a nation doesn’t necessarily correspond to women’s achievements in the sector. So how does UK and US diversity in Stem compare with other global regions?

When it comes to maths, the UK lags behind. It falls in 26th place out of 65 countries for gender equality in the OECD’s latest survey. The general conclusion was that “girls feel less motivated to learn maths and have less confidence in their abilities than boys”. The gender gap is also pronounced at the top of the academic scale and in work. One study found 42% of maths undergraduates are female, yet only 6% of maths professors are women.
A woman defying this trend is Dr Eugenia Cheng, senior lecturer in mathematics at the University of Sheffield. Cheng says a lack of confidence could be responsible for the drop-off in women pursuing maths post-degree. “I’ll often get a lot of female students saying ‘I don’t understand anything; I’m much worse at this than everyone else’.” But less confident female students often score higher marks than their more self-assured male peers, she says.
Cheng tries to encourage her tentative female students. “There’s often one – dare I say it – male student, who will be loud and shout things out a lot. And you have to take care to show that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re good at maths.”
Another way to help young women develop confidence in Stem studies is by celebrating successful women in the field. “Visibility of women in senior roles in science helps to normalise it in young women’s minds,” says Professor Anne Glover, vice-principal at University of Aberdeen and the first chief scientific adviser to the European Commission.

In the US, only 26% of computing jobs are held by women. Cultural attitudes there have a significant influence on the number of women in Stem careers. A recent study found that rather than too few girls opting to study scientific subjects or women forgoing careers to care for their children, the biggest cause of gender imbalance in Stem is cultural. Women feel the need to straddle a thin line between being masculine enough to fit in with the culture and feminine enough to not appear pushy.
Women making a noise about the cultural bias in Stem is also effective. Ellen Pao may have lost a high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit against her former employer, but in the process she highlighted the lack of women in the most powerful positions in Silicon Valley. The lawsuit, and the resulting media coverage, is said to have encouraged venture capital firms to address the gender imbalance. In the weeks following the court ruling, former Twitter and Facebook employees similarly filed gender discrimination lawsuits.

Technology firms in India have a better female to male staff ratio than the tech giants of Silicon Valley. In his book Geek Sublime, Vikram Chandra points out that 30% of programmers in India are female compared with 21% in the US.
Female role models could be having a positive influence. Kumud Srinivasan offers a positive example of an Indian women excelling in technology. President of Intel India and chairperson of the board of governors of the National Institute of Technology-Trichy, Srinivasan offers an insight into the relatively high proportion of women in technology roles in India. “There have been focused efforts by the government, industry and academia towards attracting and retaining girls and women in Stem,” she says.
She also points to Chandra’s book in which he describes “the machismo of tech geeks in the US” and says that it’s something that appears to be absent in India. “It may well be the reason behind the higher proportion [of women in IT] here,” Srinivasan says.

While the number of women in Stem in many countries can be disheartening, there are some bright spots where progress can be seen. Latin America, for example, presented some positive achievements in a recent Unesco report – 45% of scientific researchers in Latin America are women, putting the region ahead of the global average of 29%.
Alicia Kowaltowski is a professor of biochemistry at the University of São Paulo. She says the recent development of six-month paid maternity leave for women, including graduates and postdoc researchers, has helped. She adds: “Our pay comes fully from the universities, so missing a grant deadline due to raising a family will not decrease your salary. To me, the situation of women in the US, who mostly don’t have paid maternity leave and where childcare costs half a postdoc’s salary, is unfathomable.”
Kowaltowski believes female role models are important. “There are many women scientists who frequently appear in the media here. High-level awards for female scientists help [get] the word out about these women” she says.
“It is an irony that in countries where a science career is seen as lower status, female representation is higher,” she adds, connecting this with the high gender imbalance in the UK. She points out that there are more successful female astronomers in Brazil than in the UK.
It seems that a change in cultural perceptions is crucial to encourage girls and women to pursue Stem careers. “We need it to be seen as something very normal for a woman to embark upon a career in science, not a major challenge,” Glover says.

David Cameron is considering sending his son to an exclusive £18,000-a-year preparatory school which is regarded as a “feeder” institution for his alma mater, Eton.
The prime minister and his wife, Samantha, are reportedly considering plans to send nine-year-old Elwen to Colet Court. The school, in Barnes, south-west London, is linked to St Paul’s school, which was attended by the chancellor, George Osborne, and maintains close connections with Eton.
It is understood the Camerons are also considering other schools and have not made a final decision. The disclosure was made on Saturday night by the Mail on Sunday. Downing Street has complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation [Ipso] about the article and any follow up pieces.
However, critics will claim Cameron has previously been happy to discuss his possible choice of schools for his children. As opposition leader in 2009, Cameron said he would like his children to go through the state sector.
“I think it’s crazy that we should pay lots of money for private schools. We all pay our taxes. You should have really good state schools available for all,” he said. He spoke last year of his relief after his daughter Nancy, 12, secured a place at a top state school near Downing Street.

Cameron said the news that she had been accepted at the Grey Coat Hospital school, in Westminster, which was founded in 1698 and is now a Church of England academy, was “a weight off everybody’s mind”.
However, he has also said he would “always do the right thing” for his children and “has nothing against the independent sector”.
Colet Court describes itself on its website as “an independent school offering an outstanding, all-round education for gifted boys aged seven to 18 years”. It costs £6,000 a term and charges fees for registering and entrance exams.
Former pupils, known as Coletines, include the actor Eddie Redmayne and the financier Nat Rothschild. Former prime minister Tony Blair was also heavily criticised for sending his sons to the selective Oratory school in south London.
According to Ipso’s code of conduct, editors must not use the fame, notoriety or position of a parent or guardian as sole justification for publishing details of a child’s private life.
Editors are also expected to justify intrusions into any individual’s private life without consent. Ipso has been backed by the majority of the UK press industry, but not the Guardian, Independent and the Financial Times.
Downing Street declined to comment."

One of Britain’s elite universities defended its record on diversity on Sunday as the government said it should “shine a spotlight” on its admissions decisions for ethnic minority and disadvantaged students.
At the weekend, David Cameron accused the University of Oxford – where he studied as an undergraduate – of “not doing enough to attract talent from across our country”, and noted that Oxford accepted just 27 black British students in a single year. The prime minister vowed to create new laws to shame elite universities into improving diversity.
Downing Street said there were “huge discrepancies in the offers made by universities to students from disadvantaged backgrounds”, and added: “Wide-ranging data will be published showing the ethnic, gender and socio-economic breakdown for applications, entry, and retention in key disciplines at all higher education institutions.”
On Sunday, however, the University of Oxford said it did “not see the need” for such legislation and insisted the effects of social inequality were “already pronounced before children begin formal schooling” and could not be addressed by higher education alone.
Downing Street said that Sajid Javid, the business secretary, is to chair a meeting on Monday with education leaders to discuss the issue.

Universities currently publish similar data but government sources suggested the proposals could include a more detailed breakdown by social and economic categories, including applications, offers and acceptances for individual departments alongside A-level scores of those accepted or rejected.
Jo Johnson, the universities minister, said: “Legislation for a new transparency duty will shine a spotlight on the whole admissions process and expose where offer rates for some of the poorest students and those from black and minority backgrounds are particularly low.”
The move builds on new transparency requirements in the government’s higher education green paper published last year by Johnson.
The initiative to publish more detailed figures was strongly supported by Les Ebdon, head of the Office for Fair Access, which oversees universities’ efforts to widen participation in return for them charging higher £9,000 tuition fees.
Ebdon said Cameron was “right to highlight the wide gaps – both in access and outcomes – between students of different ethnic backgrounds.
“It is important that universities retain responsibility for their own admissions policies but I am very pleased to see this commitment to increased data and transparency around the make-up of student bodies.”
Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute and a former government special advisor, said the nature of Cameron’s comments meant the likelihood of new higher education legislation was growing fast.
“There’s been a great deal of uncertainty about that to date, which means ministers haven’t had as many positive headlines as they would have been hoping for,” Hillman said.
Oxford University accused of bias against ethnic minority applicants Read more
Cameron’s article in the Sunday Times said that discrimination in all walks of life needed to be “stamped out”. He wrote: “Another area where we need action is our universities. It’s striking that in 2014, our top university, Oxford, accepted just 27 black men and women out of an intake of more than 2,500. I know the reasons are complex, including poor schooling, but I worry that the university I was so proud to attend is not doing enough to attract talent from across our country.
“And these problems go deep elsewhere, too: white British men from poor backgrounds are five times less likely to go into higher education than others.”
In response, Oxford said it was making progress in publishing admissions data and improving access, having accepted 367 UK-based undergraduates from ethnic minority backgrounds in 2015, a 15% increase compared with 319 admitted in 2010.
Oxford’s intake of British undergraduates from black backgrounds – including those defining themselves as mixed heritage – had grown by more than 60% since 2010, from 39 to 64.
Oxford university admits around 2,500 undergraduates each year.
“We are constantly working to update what information we provide and although we do not see the need for further legislation, we would welcome discussions on what more information we could publish,” an Oxford spokesperson said.
Oxford noted that 13% of its undergraduates were from black or ethnic minority backgrounds, compared with 18% at others within the Russell Group of leading research universities.
Revealed: how ethnic minority graduates lose out on jobs Read more
Cameron’s accusation comes after Oxford was embroiled in dealing with how to commemorate the controversial colonialist Cecil Rhodes, with Oriel College deciding to keep a statue of Rhodes on its site after allegations of pressure from wealthy alumni.
Hillman said that Cameron’s “killer facts” on admissions needed to be discussed: “But we must not miss the bigger picture. Roughly 1% of all UK undergraduates are at Oxford or Cambridge. So you can’t transform society through those two institutions alone.
“Widening opportunity across the board makes more difference than investing in the zero-sum and imperfect game of who should get a place at our oldest and most selective universities.”
Recent figures show that other elite universities, including Bristol, St Andrews and Durham as well as Cambridge, have also struggled to substantially increase representation from different social and ethnic groups.
Cameron said the police, military and courts were all the focus of a new effort to tackle social inequality, suggesting it might be fuelled by “ingrained, institutional and insidious” racism. Labour MP David Lammy has been recruited by No 10 to carry out a major review into discrimination in the criminal justice system, including why black offenders are more likely to be jailed for the same offences as their white criminal counterpart."
Google|HMRC|Tax avoidance|Corporate governance|Sajid Javid|news,2016-01-31T11:57:15,guardian,Rajeev Syal,Business secretary Sajid Javid says he shared Britons’ sense of injustice as criticism grows of agreement with tech firm,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/31/google-tax-deal-not-a-glorious-moment-says-minister,"Google tax deal 'not a glorious moment', says minister",en,tech,,"Business secretary Sajid Javid says he shared Britons’ sense of injustice as criticism grows of agreement with tech firm
A senior government minister has admitted the tax settlement between Google and the UK government “was not a glorious moment”.
The admission by the business secretary, Sajid Javid, came as a senior executive from Google claimed he could not say how much UK profit has been generated by the technology firm in the past decade, or how many meetings had been held between the company’s executives and ministers.
It follows the announcement nine days ago that the government came to an agreement with Google in which £130m will be paid in back taxes covering the past decade.
There has been growing criticism of the firm and the government over the deal, which was negotiated between HMRC officials and Google.
George Osborne, the chancellor, initially labelled the agreement a “major success”, but Javid told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that he shared the feeling of many people that there was a sense of “injustice” with the deal.
“It wasn’t a glorious moment, when people look at these issues, but it is important, I think, to talk about also what the government is doing,” he said.
Javid was asked if he agreed it was unfair that a large corporation like Google could speak directly to the government and HMRC about its tax affairs while small- and medium-sized businesses don’t have that option available to them.
“I speak with thousands of companies, small- and medium-sized as well as of course large companies, and there is a sense of injustice with what they see,” he said.
“They do look at this and they say, ‘Look, I don’t operate all these multiple jurisdictions around the world, I can’t shift profits around, what about me, where’s the level playing field?’ and I share that sense and the sort of sense of unfairness that exists.”
Peter Barron, head of communications at Google across Europe, told the Andrew Marr Show he could not answer questions about Google’s profits over the past decade despite reports that it had made £7.2bn and therefore is paying less than 3% in corporation tax on its UK profits.
He said the firm pays corporation tax of 20% and claimed there had been no “sweetheart deal”.
“We have a settlement with HMRC, the government sets the law, HMRC enforces it and we follow it. The £130m was an additional tax. For the last 18 months we paid £42.6m. It [the UK] is our second biggest global market but identifying the added value in the UK is a difficult business,” Barron said.
Asked why Google paid its taxes in Ireland, which has significantly lower corporation tax, he said that most advertising deals were closed in Ireland.
“Corporation tax is not on sales or revenues, it is on profit. Identifying what the profit has been over the last 10 years is quite a business,” he said.
Google is expected to announce on Monday that it has amassed £30bn of profits from non-US sales in Bermuda, where companies are not liable to pay corporation tax. The UK is Google’s largest non-US market, accounting for 11% of its global revenues, according to documents filed in America.
The Observer revealed that the UK government has been privately lobbying the EU to remove Bermuda from an official blacklist.
Barron said the arrangement in Bermuda had no impact on the amount of tax it pays in the UK. “It’s very, very important to make it clear that the Bermuda arrangement has absolutely no bearing on the amount of tax that we pay in the UK. No bearing whatsoever,” he said.
When asked how much of the £30bn may have come from the UK, he said: “I don’t know the answer, I haven’t got the answer [at] my fingertips, except I would say that about 10% of global revenues come from the UK.”"

The Screen Actors Guild awards provided a counterbalance to the much-protested lack of ethnic diversity the Oscar nominations on Saturday as the actors union honoured four black actors: Idris Elba, who won two awards, Viola Davis, Uzo Aduba and Queen Latifah.
“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to diverse TV,” said Elba, presenting an award after Davis’s win. The British actor won outstanding performance by a male actor in a supporting role for Beasts of No Nation, and outstanding performance by a male actor in a TV movie or miniseries for Luther. Controversially, he has been overlooked entirely for the Oscars.
The top award went to Spotlight for outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture, about the Boston Globe’s expose of a network of paedophile priests. Michael Keaton dedicated the award to “the disenfranchised everywhere, for every Flint, Michigan in the world, for the disadvantaged and the powerless”. He added: “There’s fair and there’s unfair and I’m always going to vote for the good guys.”
However, the film’s rival for the best picture Oscar, The Big Short, is still the hot favourite, as it won the Producers Guild award – a reliable bellwether for the top prize at the Academy awards.
It was also a good night for British actors, with Downton Abbey winning outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series. Meanwhile Australians Ruby Rose and Yael Stone won as part of the Orange is the New Black ensemble, and Mad Max: Fury Road took home best performance by a stunt ensemble.
Leonardo DiCaprio’s trajectory to his first Oscar looks unassailable as the actor picked up the outstanding performance by a male actor in a leading role for The Revenant, to add to the Golden Globe he won earlier this month. On the red carpet, DiCaprio described the film as “epic arthouse” and said that it was the kind of film he’d like to make more of – despite a gruelling shoot that saw the actor eating raw bison liver, an incident mocked by Amy Poehler and Tina Fey when presenting the lifetime achievement award to Carol Burnett.
“So you slept in a horse, and you ate bison liver, big whoop,” said Poehler. “Carol would have slept in that horse, worn it, done a song and a dance and made a much funnier face after eating something very disgusting.”
The TV awards saw streaming sites dominate, with Netflix’s Orange is the New Black taking two awards and Jeffrey Tambor taking outstanding performance by a male actor in a comedy series for his lead role as a transgender woman in Amazon’s Transparent. Tambor dedicated his award to the transgender people who don’t have the wealth and privileges of his character, “for their operations, for their medicines, for their freedom”.
Winning outstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series, Davis gave arguably the most stirring speech of the night, saying: “People are always saying, ‘Wow, Annalise is an antihero. Don’t you worry she’s not likable? Don’t you worry that she’s not a mentor?’ And I always think: ‘Why do I have to be a hero? Why do you have to like me? Why do I have to be a mentor?’ My job as an actor is to create a human being to the best of my ability. Flawed, messy, maybe not always likable. Maybe not cute. But it is my job and I do it to the best of my ability and I get so much joy out of being an actor.”
Meanwhile, Alicia Vikander, who won outstanding performance by a female actor in a supporting role for The Danish Girl, thanked the trans community in her tearful acceptance speech, another indication of the respect for diversity that set this ceremony apart from the Oscars."
Terry Wogan|BBC|Radio|Television|Radio 2|features,2016-01-31T15:40:44,guardian,Mark Lawson,"Inspired by satirist Brian O’Nolan, Wogan was often considered cosy but knew a gentle tone can distract from bold content",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/31/terry-wogan-intriguingly-subversive-national-treasure,Terry Wogan: the intriguingly subversive national treasure,en,UK|media,,"Sir Terry Wogan, who has died at the age of 77, owed much of his success to one stereotypical attribute of the Irish: a fluent and mellifluous delivery. But his enduring popularity was also underwritten by another quality found more often in his home country than most others: a love of language and literature.
Sir Terry Wogan: tributes to BBC broadcaster dead aged 77 - latest updates Read more
He was a keen reader of Irish authors from James Joyce to William Trevor and, above all, Brian O’Nolan, the satirist and surrealist whose wild but jaunty tone Wogan knowingly adapted to the airwaves. Possessing a natural high intelligence – honed by education in Limerick and Dublin from Jesuit priests, the intellectual SAS of the Roman Catholic church – Wogan became one of the few presenters on radio music stations whose audiences routinely wanted the singers to shut up so that they could hear more of the host talking.
His career-defining work came in two long stints on the Radio 2 breakfast show, from 1972-84 and then 1993-2009, the first after a rather ill-fitting spell at the newly formed Radio 1 in the late 60s. He had been recruited to the pop station following a short but high-profile Irish radio career that began after Wogan, having fulfilled his family’s wishes by becoming a bank clerk, answered a newspaper advert for an announcer.
In his two occupations of the Radio 2 morning slot, Wogan memorably applied a vital lesson – the benefit of building up a stock of catchphrases and characters – learned from O’Nolan, who wrote novels, including At Swim-Two-Birds, under the name Flann O’Brien, and whose newspaper columns, under the byline Myles na gCopaleen, Wogan had read when growing up.
So, for example, on air, Wogan’s wife, Helen, was always the “present Mrs Wogan” or, after he became Sir Terry in 2005, “the present Lady Wogan”, wryly implying an impermanence that was actually the opposite of their devoted 51-year marriage. Older listeners were “coffin dodgers”, while radio colleagues received nicknames; the announcer Alan Dedicoat becoming “Deadly Alancoat.” Sir Jimmy Young, for a long time a senior Radio 2 colleague, would feature, reportedly to his disgruntlement, in word-sketches featuring “the ancient broadcaster, trundling into the studio on his portable commode”. The final flourish in that riff was very O’Nolan.

If a supply of recyclable references had been a godsend for a newspaper columnist, it was perhaps even more so to a broadcaster with up to two and a half hours to fill five times a week. Wogan also understood, long before modern communications made this a standard part of broadcasting, what a valuable resource the audience could be. Drawing heavily from that old fashioned social media device, the postbag, he read out letters, stories and limericks – a deliberate nod to his beloved Irish birthplace – that not only provided a free script but created a sense of community with listeners who, in their latter years together, styled themselves “Terry’s Old Geezers and Gals” or Togs.
Although sometimes considered cosy – and, in latter years, often admitted by commentators to that body of harmless charmers known as national treasures – Wogan had, in his personality and patter, an intriguingly subversive, even dirty streak. Among the ranks of the supposed treasures of the nation, he was perhaps closer in sensibility to Alan Bennett, who hates the tag, than to Dame Vera Lynn.
A regular feature of his Radio 2 breakfast show in its second incarnation were the “Janet and John” stories, sent in by listeners, in which the children from the Ladybird books, now in adulthood, became involved in adventures that culminated in punchlines of eye-popping innuendo. If the same material had been read on air by Jonathan Ross or Russell Brand, investigations and suspensions might have followed, but Wogan, in another lesson from O’Brien, understood how gentle tone and persona can distract from bolder content.
Another of his tricks in this direction was to leave the audience to supply the joke. During a brief fashion for celebrated women to wear the name of their husband on their T-shirts – so that Madonna might be seen sporting the word “Ritchie”, in honour of her spouse at the time – Wogan murmured between records one morning: “I’d fancy the wife of the present director general will not be doing that.” The BBC’s DG at the time was Greg Dyke.

In common with some of Wogan’s other on-air fantasies – including the “dance of the BBC virgins” that supposedly took place on the roof of Broadcasting House each morning – these gags may have benefited from occurring before the time when social groups could take instant collective offence at things said by presenters.
His wit could be more openly wicked away from the microphone. Wogan once remarked in a BBC hospitality box at the Proms that he no longer played much golf because the rest of his foursome had all been arrested by Operation Yewtree. This was comic exaggeration, but he was deeply relieved by the complete exoneration of his friend Jimmy Tarbuck, and viscerally horrified by the revelations about Rolf Harris, another member of the Thameside showbiz set.
Such sharp humour was most apparent on air in Wogan’s laconic television commentaries on the Eurovision Song Contest, which were reputed to have brought protests to the BBC from the broadcasters and even ambassadors of some of the countries whose competitors he skewered. He escaped discipline, though, because these voiceovers were another example of his clever use of found material. Most often, he was merely reciting, with a slight inflection of scepticism, the descriptions of the host nations or songs distributed by publicists.
This critic’s gift, rare in a form of broadcasting where presenters tend more naturally to be optimists or publicists, was also on display, during his first run of Radio 2 mornings, in the acerbic demolitions of the American soap opera Dallas. They could be as sharp-eyed as the critiques of the same series that were making the name of Clive James, the Observer TV critic, at the same time.

What radio crucially gave Wogan was time to digress and invent. One reason that his thrice-weekly BBC chatshow, screened from 1985-92, was regarded as a relative blot on his biography is that the short 35-minute format, generally with three guests, inevitably cramped his verbal imagination and flow. Also, by instinct an improviser, he struggled to adapt to scripts on Autocue and briefs written by producers, who would sometimes complain that he was busking his way through interviews. Revealingly, his best moments on that show depended on reaction rather than preparation, as when he warned David Icke, the former Coventry City goalkeeper who had unexpectedly declared himself to be the son of God, that the chortling audience was “laughing at you, not with you”.
And, despite the tendency of the TV series to be regarded, to his annoyance, as a failure, no show in the BBC1 7pm slot has achieved equivalent ratings in the two decades since Wogan was axed. Having guessed the way the commission was going, he had asked to leave a year before it ended, but was begged to stay on. He subsequently learned that the extension was to allow the set of Eldorado, the soap opera planned as a replacement, to be completed in Spain.

Although at heart a kind man, Wogan declared himself unable ever to forgive the BBC television executive, still a very prominent presence at the organisation, who truncated his career at the broadcaster and, Wogan believed, had been less than straight with him during the process of demotion.
He always refused to name his nemesis publicly, less from kindness than from the survival instincts of a freelance. It has recently been reported that he was “too busy” to give evidence to Dame Janet Smith’s inquiry into his former Radio 1 colleague Jimmy Savile. And, while Wogan’s diary was often scarily packed, his elusiveness may also have owed something to his belief, genially passed on to younger broadcasters, that it was safer to keep well away from any matters involving BBC managers.
True to this creed, on 18 December 2009, during his final Radio 2 breakfast show, Wogan intervened during a record to thin out the ranks of corporation bosses who had gathered behind the studio window to witness his last moments on air. He was also furious when one high-up suggested that he might be “overdoing the sentimentality” during that programme.
However, though distrustful of BBC bosses, Wogan was notably supportive, both on and off the record, of Chris Evans, who replaced him on the radio, and Graham Norton, who took over the Eurovision commentary on TV. It is often tough to be appreciative of a successor, but Wogan recognised worthy and appropriate replacements in Evans’s rapport with the audience and Norton’s facility with language. It helped that, with the single exception of his sacking from the chatshow, Wogan had the unusual luxury of always having chosen his own moment of departure from major shows.
A benevolent mentor to many other broadcasters, Wogan would pass on pieces of wisdom including: “Television is about innovation, but radio is about repetition.” He meant this to explain why sound careers tended to be longer than screen ones, and it proved so in his case, with his post-chatshow return to Radio 2 leading to his finest work as a broadcaster.
Despite this, his strong sense of professional pride led him – after BBC TV ended an exclusive television contract, restricting him to the charity telethon Children in Need and occasional documentaries about Ireland – to turn up on Channel 4 and Channel 5 in order to signal that the reduction in demand had been internal rather than external. But, though he expected Television Centre executives to get the point, he was careful not to be bitter in public about career reverses.

Where he could become tetchy, both publicly and privately, was at any discussion of his hair. From relatively early on, fellow DJs would refer to him behind his back as “Terry Wig-On”, a tag that became public in the reviews of the TV critic Victor Lewis-Smith. Wogan had a prepared monologue for interviewers, along the lines of “If a man were to take steps in that direction, would he [gesture at the dark curve across his scalp] take these particular strides?”, which can be seen as a non-denial denial. However, in contrast to other odd coiffures such as Donald Trump’s, Wogan’s arrangements, whatever they were, did change shape and shade as he aged.
He had a canny understanding of the mechanics of fame. When he was on BBC1 three times a week, and it was difficult for him to walk down a street or visit a restaurant without harassment, he became worried that his children were taking flak at school due to his fame. The advice he gave them – “Whatever they say about me, just agree with them” – was both practical and anti-egomaniacal in a way that was very him.
Strikingly, the other broadcasters he most admired – including Alistair Cooke, John Arlott and John Cole – were often those who had a way with words on the page, and he always planned, with the time freed by giving up the daily Radio 2 show in exchange for a Sunday slot, to do more writing. Last October, a book of short stories, Those Were The Days, bitter-wistful for a lost Ireland, was added to his already heavy shelf of memoirs and anecdote collections that famous entertainers routinely produce.
Terry Wogan: from son of an Irish grocer to legendary broadcaster Read more
In November last year, Wogan withdrew at the last moment from hosting Children in Need, citing what was described as a “procedure on his back”. When he subsequently took leave from his Radio 2 Sunday show as well, there were ominous rumours in broadcasting of serious illness, but Wogan, always determined to protect his loved ones from the consequences of his recognition, chose to complete his life in total privacy. And so, for the Togs, this will be their Bowie moment.
Wary of public shows of emotion, especially in broadcasting studios, Wogan had been determined to deliver the closing link of his final Radio 2 breakfast show in a manner that he characteristically described as “manful”. However, he had tellingly taken the precaution of making written notes for possibly the only time in his radio career and, reading from them, audibly broke down. The next broadcaster on air, Ken Bruce, left an appropriate pause before thanking Wogan and saying: “We will never see his like again.”
Well, an equivalent may, perhaps, be seen, as he was a very good, rather than great, television presenter. Radio listeners, though, are unlikely ever to hear his like again. Although a lapsed Catholic, Wogan once expressed the hope that, when the time came, people might light a candle for him, a traditional way in the religion of remembering the dead.
Millions will want to do so now, either literally or metaphorically, because Terry Wogan channelled his love of literature and Ireland and his innate good nature to become one of the most original and enjoyable talkers in the history of British broadcasting."
Bangladesh|South and Central Asia|news,2016-01-31T10:37:45,guardian,Agence France-Presse,Abul Bajandar preparing for operation to remove extremely rare epidermodysplasia verruciformis warts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/31/bangladesh-tree-man-abul-banjadar-surgery,Bangladesh's 'Tree Man' to undergo surgery,en,world,,"A Bangladeshi father nicknamed Tree Man for massive bark-like warts on his hands and feet will finally have surgery to remove the growths that first began appearing 10 years ago, a hospital has said.
Abul Bajandar, from the southern district of Khulna, was undergoing preparations for the surgery to cut out the growths weighing at least 5kg (11lb) that have smothered his hands and feet.
“Initially, I thought that they’re harmless,” the 26-year-old told AFP at the Dhaka medical college hospital. “But slowly I lost all my ability to work. There are now dozens of two-to-three-inch roots in both my hands. And there are some small ones in my legs,” said Bajandar who was forced to quit working as a bicycle-puller.
A team of doctors will perform the operation at DMCH, Bangladesh’s largest state-run hospital, which has decided to waive the costs of the treatment. Tests are under way to ensure Bajandar’s warts can be removed surgically without damaging major nerves or causing any other health problems.
The warts, which first started appearing when he was a teenager but began spreading rapidly four years ago, have been diagnosed as epidermodysplasia verruciformis, an extremely rare genetic skin disease that makes the person susceptible to skin growths.

“Popularly it is known as tree-man disease,” the DMCH director, Samanta Lal Sen, told AFP. “As far as we know there are three such cases in the world including Abul Bajandar. It is the first time we have found such a rare case in Bangladesh,” he said.
An Indonesian villager with massive warts all over his body underwent a string of operations in 2008 to remove them.
Bajandar’s elder sister, Adhuri Bibi, said hundreds of people have visited their home in Khulna over the years to see him. “Even here at the hospital, hundreds have already gathered,” she told AFP.
Bajandar said he tried cutting the warts when they first appeared, but it was extremely painful. “After that I went to a village homeopath and herbal specialist. But those medicines only worsened my condition.”
He also consulted doctors in neighbouring India, but he and his family could not afford the cost of an operation there."

Former defence minister Liam Fox increased pressure on figures such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove by pointing out that they will be judged on their decisions as the UK moves towards an in/out referendum.
His comments have been timed to coincide with a crucial meeting between the prime minister and Donald Tusk, the European council president, who was due at Downing Street on Sunday for a working dinner to discuss the details of proposed reforms ahead of a summit in February. A proposed “emergency brake” on EU citizens claiming welfare in the UK is expected to be discussed – but the proposal has already been dismissed by Tory Eurosceptics.
In an interview with Radio 4’s The World This Weekend, Fox said Eurosceptic figures must maintain their integrity and vote to leave the EU, or risk political consequences.
“Remember that the judgment you make will reflect upon your judgment, politically, for the rest of your career. Go with what you actually believe because, whether it is popular or unpopular in the short term, be protected by the cloak of your own integrity. In the end, MPs need to do what they believe is right for the country, not what is right for them,” he said.
Government sources say Cameron is prepared to hold out for as long as it takes to get a proper deal he can sell to the British public, even if it means pushing back the referendum to next year.
The emergency brake proposal has been put forward by Brussels as an alternative to Cameron’s original plan to impose a unilateral four-year curb that other member states ruled out as discriminatory and in breach of the freedom of movement principle.
The prime minister cancelled a trip to Scandinavia to fly to Brussels to discuss the idea with the EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the president of the European parliament, Martin Schulz.
Cameron said the mechanism was “not good enough” in its current form and he is expected to seek assurances that present levels of migration will be deemed sufficient to trigger it and that it could remain in place “long enough to resolve the underlying problem”, perhaps for up to seven years.
Cameron will insist it should only be regarded as a “stopgap” while a more permanent solution is worked on.

Hilary Benn, the shadow foreign secretary, claimed Cameron had not seen the “big picture” if he was willing to leave the union over welfare reform proposals for EU citizens, which are expected to be published within days.
Benn told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News: “To have brought the whole future of our relationship with the European Union down to this one issue shows that the prime minister, I think, is missing the big picture.”
The shadow foreign secretary said Cameron should have pointed out that the EU has given the UK jobs, investment, growth, security and influence.
“The idea that you would say ‘Well, if I don’t get just this one thing in the perfect form I am seeking, then we are off’ is not actually the leadership we should expect from our prime minister.”
Reaching a deal at the summit on 18-19 February is seen as vital if Cameron wants to hold an early referendum on EU membership because an agreement at a later date would make it hard to schedule a vote before the school summer holidays.
Cameron's willingness to adapt EU reforms riles Eurosceptics Read more
Cameron, however, has insisted he would not do a deal “at any price” and is prepared to hold off with the plebiscite – which must be held by the end of 2017 – if he considers the deal on the table to be inadequate.
Eurosceptics have dismissed the proposals on the table as “pretty thin gruel” that would do little or nothing to stem the flow of would-be workers arriving in the UK, notably from eastern European states.
Steve Baker, the co-chair of the anti-EU Conservatives for Britain group, said Cameron was engaged in a “synthetic” row with Brussels and dismissed the renegotiation as a “farce”.
Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday Politics, Baker indicated there would have to be major changes within Vote Leave to maintain support from MPs.
At the heart of the internal dispute is the role of Cummings and his insistence that they should not join forces with Leave.EU, which is closely aligned to Ukip. Both groups are fighting to achieve official designation from the electoral commission as the main out campaign group – which would entitle them to public funding of more than £500,000.

Asked about the leadership of Vote Leave, Baker said: “Given the severe concerns of my colleagues it’s quite clear there are going to have to be material changes in Vote Leave in order to carry parliamentarians with the campaign.”
It is thought that the proposed benefit ban would be available to all EU states, and be activated when migration levels were deemed high enough to put public services or welfare systems under severe strain.
It is one of four areas where Cameron is seeking reforms, alongside the lifting of member states’ commitment to “ever closer union”, measures to protect non-euro states and improve EU competitiveness, and greater powers for national parliaments.
He is expected to press for the current proposals relating to all four areas to be strengthened further, as well as for action to tackle “back door” immigration into the UK and other “abuses” of free movement rules."
Electoral reform|Students|Higher education|Mayoral elections|Local government|Local politics|news,2016-01-31T16:00:06,guardian,Rowena Mason,Figures compiled by Labour find register has shrunk dramatically in areas with high student population,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/31/electoral-register-loses-estimated-800000-people-since-changes-to-system,"Electoral register loses estimated 800,000 people",en,politics,,"An estimated 800,000 people have dropped off the electoral register since the government introduced changes to the system, with students in university towns at highest risk of being disenfranchised, the Guardian has learned.
Labour says it fears that the missing sections of the electorate are predominantly its supporters after the government moved from registration of electors by household to asking individuals to sign up, citing fears of fraud and error.
The estimated number of voters registered in December – the first figure under the new individual electoral registration system – is lower than in the previous year, with just months to go before May’s local, assembly and mayoral elections.
Overall 1.8% of voters are estimated to have dropped off the register across the population and figures compiled by the Labour party found the register had shrunk more dramatically in areas with a high population of students, such as Canterbury, which has seen a 13% drop, and Cambridge and Dundee West, both with an 11% fall.
Gloria De Piero, the shadow minister for electoral registration, said the data revealed an alarming reduction in students on the register, which is likely to raise fears that election results could be swayed by missing blocks of like-minded voters.
With the national voter registration drive starting today, De Piero has written to John Penrose, a Cabinet Office minister, to call for all universities to offer registration for students when they enrol.
“The transition to individual electoral registration (IER) has resulted in a significant fall in the number of people on the electoral register in areas with a university,” she said.
“As you will know, IER prevents universities from block registering all their students in halls of residence, but measures should be taken to ensure that it is as easy as possible for individual students to register.
“The University of Sheffield has seen outstanding results by integrating voter registration into the enrolment process … I write to you today to call for official guidance to be issued to every vice-chancellor in the country about how they can adopt the Sheffield model in their universities for next year’s enrolment.”
She said warnings from Labour and the Electoral Commission about a fall in student registration had so far been ignored but it was not too late to put it right.
Speaking in the Commons, Penrose has said he sympathises with Labour concerns but it is “not quite that simple”. Several methods of encouraging students to register were being tested across the country with promising results, he told MPs.
People can register until about three weeks before the next elections but the December list is also important because the government is planning to base any forthcoming boundary changes on its figures, which Labour fears could potentially skew the result of the review in favour of Conservative-held areas.
The government moved from registration of electors by household to asking individuals to sign up in a drive to increase the accuracy of the list and eliminate fraud and error. The vast majority of people have been transferred automatically from the old to the new list but around one in 10 have not. New voters must sign up as individuals from now on.
In the run-up to the transfer, the Electoral Commission raised concerns about the speed of the change and the risk of up to 1.9 million people falling off the register without a concerted publicity drive. Labour warned that about 1 million could drop off the list. Since then, the government and third parties have embarked on voter registration drives.
A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said individual registration was essential to tackle fraud. “We have worked hard with local authorities for years now to clean up the register – any entries removed will be people who have moved house, died or never existed because they were registered fraudulently,” she said."
Refugees|David Cameron|Economics|Immigration and asylum|Migration|Conservatives|news,2016-02-01T00:01:12,guardian,Julia Kollewe,"In open letter to PM, more than 120 leading economists including former UN and World Bank officials say UK can do far more",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/01/economists-david-cameron-open-letter-refugee-crisis-response-morally-unacceptable,Economists to Cameron: refugee crisis response 'morally unacceptable',en,world,,"In open letter to PM, more than 120 leading economists including former UN and World Bank officials say UK can do far more
More than 120 leading economists, among them former government, UN and World Bank officials, have lambasted the UK government’s response to the refugee crisis, calling it seriously inadequate, morally unacceptable and economically wrong.
In an open letter to David Cameron, the economists argue that as the world’s fifth-largest economy, the UK “can do far more” and are calling on the government to take a “fair and proportionate share of refugees, both those already within the EU and those still outside it”.
They are also calling for safe and legal routes to and within the EU, including the UK, and “fair and thorough procedures to determine eligibility for international protection wherever it is sought”.
The economists, who include Mark Malloch-Brown, a former UN deputy secretary general and government minister, and Peter Sutherland, the former director general of Gatt and the World Trade Organisation, wrote: “The costs in human wellbeing of the refugee crisis, however calculated, are so extremely high that it is morally unacceptable for the UK not to play a fuller part in taking in refugees.”

It is the first time that such a large group of economists have criticised UK government immigration policy, and follows other open letters to the prime minister from the UK’s 350 top judges and lawyers, and 27 charities and NGOs including Oxfam, Amnesty International and the Refugee Council.
David Cameron’s government has agreed to take up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years, from the camps on the borders of the war-torn country. More than 1,000 have arrived so far.
The numbers are dwarfed by the 1.1 million refugees taken in by Germany last year and 160,000 in Sweden, the highest in Europe as a proportion of the population. However, they and other EU countries are now trying to drastically reduce their refugee inflows.
The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, told the World Economic Forum last month that if Europe works together it can turn the challenge of tackling the refugee crisis into an opportunity that will boost growth.
The economists argue that the UK’s offer of 20,000 resettlement places to Syrians outside the EU is “too low, too slow and too narrow”. They noted that the UK in its recent history has “taken in far higher numbers of asylum seekers and refugees and at far greater speed and managed it well”.
They write: “Refugees should be taken in because they are morally and legally entitled to international protection, not because of the economic advantages they may bring. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the economic contribution of refugees and their descendants to the UK has been high.”

They noted that the thousands of Ugandan Asian refugees, whose arrival in Britain in 1972 was greeted with initial anxiety, went on to make an “extraordinary contribution” to British life, as Cameron himself has observed.
One of the signatories, Prof Lawrence King, of Cambridge University, said: “Britain is the world’s fifth-richest economy. It is a travesty to suggest that the best Britain can do in the midst of the worst refugee crisis since the second world war is to take 4,000 refugees annually over five years, which amounts to 12 a day. Britain has actually accepted fewer refugees in the past two years than it accepted per year in the previous 16 years.”
The economists also called the UK’s refugee policy “misguided” as it tried to deter refugees from travelling to the EU by refusing to accept those who have fled to Europe. They said in the letter: “That misunderstands the intolerable ‘push’ factors that are forcing people out of countries of persecution and from neighbouring countries in which a humanitarian disaster is escalating in the camps. It is the parallel of the government’s earlier policy of trying to ‘deter’ travel by scaling down search and rescue in the Mediterranean – a failed policy which cost lives.”
Last week, the government performed a partial U-turn when it agreed to take in some unaccompanied Syrian refugee children who are already in Europe, and set up a £10m fund to support them. But Cameron insisted the focus remained on taking child refugees from camps in the Syria region.

Lord Malloch-Brown said: “The refugee crisis is a challenge not just to life but to Europe’s values and responsibilities, its respect for international law and its standing in the world. The lasting damage to its international authority if it betrays its responsibilities shouldn’t be underestimated.”
Another signatory, Sir Richard Jolly, a former assistant secretary general of the UN, said: “The human cost of failure is far higher than even the most pessimistic financial cost.”
Prof Guy Standing of Soas added that welcoming more refugees would be a “sound economic policy, not just because many of the refugees will prove energetic, innovative and resourceful, but because they will help revive the image of Britain in the world, so that people will be more inclined to ‘buy British’ and invest in Britain. The costs set against the longer-term benefits would be minimal”.
Analysis published last month by the International Monetary Fund found that the influx of refugees into Europe could deliver a long-term economic boost to the EU if they are well integrated into the job market.
Signatories to the letter also included Prof Ian Goldin, former vice-president of the World Bank, John Eatwell, founder of the Institute for Public Policy Research, and Ha-Joon Chang, the bestselling author of books such as Economics: The User’s Guide.
An estimated 250,000-300,000 people have been killed and 10 million displaced since the Syrian crisis erupted nearly five years ago."

Shocked colleagues of Sir Terry Wogan paid tribute to a national treasure and broadcasting legend following his death on Sunday from cancer, which he had kept secret.
The 77-year-old Irish-born radio and TV host, who was the face of Children in Need for 35 years during a career that spanned five decades, died surrounded by family “after a short but brave battle with cancer”, his family said.
He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Lady Helen, and three children, Katherine, Mark and Alan.
Stunned friends, many of whom had no idea he was seriously ill, mourned a man they described as fun and mischievous, the “King of the Airwaves”.

The BBC Radio 2 presenter, whose Wake Up to Wogan and later Wogan’s Weekend shows attracted millions of listeners, was hailed the “finest broadcaster of a lifetime”. His TV successes included his chatshow, Wogan, the quiz show Blankety Blank and Eurovision, which he made his own through a winning combination of wit and withering asides.
He had pulled out at the last minute from presenting Children in Need 2015 in November, and also his weekend radio slot, with the BBC citing back problems and “doctor’s orders” at the time.

Father Brian D’Arcy, a friend for 40 years and presenter of the Pause for Thought slot on Wake Up to Wogan, was one of very few to know death was imminent. Wogan had only recently discovered he had cancer, he said.
D’Arcy spent Thursday with him “to say goodbye … He was quite ill at that stage, and I knew it wasn’t long,” he said.
He told BBC Radio 2: “At the same time, I’m glad he went without a long and lingering illness. It was a short enough illness at the end of the day for him. He came across it very suddenly.”
The BBC’s director general, Tony Hall, described the Limerick-born presenter as a “broadcasting legend”, a “national treasure” and “a dear friend”, as it was announced The One Show will air a special tribute on Monday night.

Longtime family friend and fellow broadcaster Henry Kelly said he was shocked because Wogan had “put it out that he had a bad back … I didn’t know he was that seriously ill. I knew he had been told not to do Children in Need because, as he quipped himself, they don’t want an ol’ fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.”
Ken Bruce, who worked alongside him on Radio 2 for 20 years, said: “None of us were expecting this, [it’s] come out of a clear blue sky, so it’s really hard to take in.”
Fellow presenter Jeremy Vine said: “None of Terry’s colleagues knew he was ill, certainly not this ill, and I’m devastated this morning to hear the news.” He described Wogan as “just a gorgeous man, a brilliant broadcaster, probably the greatest broadcaster since the invention of the microphone”.
Wogan, who was last on air just over two months ago, on Sunday 8 November, had recently published Those Were the Days, his first foray into fiction, which he had promoted at the Cheltenham literature festival in October, and had presented Proms in the Park from London’s Hyde Park, on 12 September.

In interviews at the time of his book publication he insisted he had no plans to retire, and instead intended to go on for another decade.
Michael Terence Wogan, son of a grocery manager, embarked on a career at the Royal Bank of Ireland before giving it up to become a newsreader and announcer at Irish broadcaster RTE. His big break at the BBC came when he provided holiday cover for Sir Jimmy Young.
He soon had his own breakfast show and for 27 years millions woke up to his Irish brogue. When audience figures surpassed eight million in 2005, he joked: “Hang on. There’s 60 million people in the country, what are the other 52 million listening to?”
He accumulated a huge number of devoted fans, or Togs – Terry’s Old Geezers and Gals. They apparently included the Queen. When Wogan was chosen to welcome her on a visit to Broadcasting House, she said: “I’m a Tog.”

His success was down to being his natural self, said controller of Radio 2, Bob Shennan, who recalled how Jeremy Vine once asked him if he prepared for his programmes. “Terry said: ‘No. I’ll just get out of the lift and I’ll wander into the studio. I’ll open the microphone and we’ll see what people have got to say.’ And that was how he did it. And it was why he was so good.”
Among many highlights in a glittering career, his chatshow interviews with George Best, at the height of the footballer’s alcoholism, and an astonishing interview with former BBC sports presenter turned conspiracy theorist David Icke, who refused to deny he thought he was the son of God, stood out.
President Michael Higgins led tributes in Ireland, with the taoiseach, Enda Kenny, describing him as a man who was “in no small way a bridge between Ireland and Britain”. Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, said he was “a truly fabulous broadcaster” whose “Eurovision coverage was legendary for its wit”. A Eurovision spokesman described him as “without doubt the most remarkable Eurovision commentator in history”.
“Hard to quantify what he achieved, not just in broadcasting, but for the Irish in Britain”, comedian Dara O’Briain tweeted. Chatshow host Graham Norton tweeted: “He made it seem effortless and for a young boy in Ireland, he made it seem possible.”
Chris Evans, Wogan’s Radio 2 breakfast show replacement in 2009 said: ”Can’t put into words how the whole Radio 2 family is feeling”. TV presenter Zoe Ball tweeted: “Dearest Terry Wogan, master of the radio waves, so brilliantly naughty & funny, a true gentleman.”

Former presenter of The X Factor and fellow Radio 2 DJ Dermot O’Leary, who stepped in to present Children in Need, paid tribute on Instagram, writing: “Thank you Terry. For everything.”
Presenter Chris Tarrant described him as “the finest broadcaster of my lifetime”.
A small number of bouquets were left outside his family home in the Buckinghamshire village of Taplow. In Limerick, where he was born, a book of condolence was opened to “a true son of Limerick”.
Wogan was a self-declared atheist, having lost any faith following the death of his and his wife’s three-week-old firstborn daughter.
D’Arcy said he was a true family man. “Anyone who ever went to the Wogan household understands there are no pictures of stars around the walls of his house.

A battle lasting more than a quarter of a century over the Western Wall, the religious site revered by Jews all over the world, has resulted in a historic deal to create a space where men and women are permitted to pray together in equality.
On Sunday, the Israeli government approved the creation of a permanent and official separate area for mixed gender praying at the site in Jerusalem’s Old City. Liberal and reform Jews hailed the move as a victory for Jews everywhere.
Women of the Wall has campaigned for equal prayer rights at the Western Wall for the past 27 years, holding monthly protests in the plaza in front of the wall’s ancient golden stones. The gatherings frequently ended in physical tussles and arrests.
The women’s demands were anathema to Israel’s ultra-Orthodox religious establishment, which manages the site. The rules governing worship – set by the Western Wall rabbi, Shmuel Rabinowitz – forbade men and women from praying together. A small section of the wall is sectioned off for women.
Women of the Wall also demanded an end to ultra-orthodox bans on women praying aloud, reading from the Torah and wearing traditional prayer shawls, known as tallit.
Thousands of Jews pray every day at the site, the last remnant of the retaining wall of the Temple Mount, pushing scraps of paper bearing handwritten prayers into the cracks between the ancient stones. The site also attracts thousands of tourists and international dignitaries, with Pope Francis, Barack Obama and Madonna among global figures who have prayed at the wall.
The new section for non-Orthodox mixed gender prayer will double the size and make permanent an area designated under a temporary compromise reached in 2013 after Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu ordered a solution to be found to the dispute. The expanded area, costing £6m, will accommodate 1,200 worshippers and be officially registered in Israel’s Law of Holy Sites. It will be administered by government officials.
The Israeli cabinet approved the plan without a formal vote. Ultra-Orthodox cabinet members criticised the move, with interior minister Aryeh Deri saying: “For all the years of its existence, the state of Israel has conducted itself based on traditional Judaism.”

The Israel Religious Action Centre and the Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism hailed Sunday’s agreement as historic. “For decades, Israel has given full religious authority at the Kotel [the Western Wall] to Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Judaism. That is about to change,” said Rabbis Noa Sattah and Gilad Kariv in a joint statement.
They added: “This will put an end to the embarrassing spectacle of male and female soldiers and officials being segregated at government and military events, and to situations where the Kotel’s Orthodox rabbi refuses to let women light menorahs or female soldiers to sing our national anthem, Hatikvah, in public.
“This landmark decision gives expression to a fundamental truth: there is more than one way to be Jewish. There is more than one way to pray. There is more than one way to connect to Jewish traditions and identity.”
Women of the Wall spokeswoman Shira Pruce said the decision was a “revolution for women and Jewish pluralism in Israel”.
“By approving this plan, the state acknowledges women’s full equality and autonomy at the Kotel and the imperative of freedom of choice in Judaism in Israel,” she said.
Rabbi Danny Rich, chief executive of Liberal Judaism, the sister movement of Reform Judaism in Israel, said: “This is a landmark decision for Jews across the globe. It recognises that Judaism is an inclusive religion with a variety of different but valid expressions.
“Equality of gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation are central to Liberal Judaism and now at last liberal Jews can celebrate a Judaism in keeping with the modern world at our most holy site.”
The Western Wall forms part of a huge compound in the Old City, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram ash-Sharif. It is the third holiest place in Islam after Mecca and Medina, and the site of the Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa mosque.
The Women of the Wall protests attracted global attention three years ago when the US comedian Sarah Silverman tweeted in response to the arrests of her sister, Susan, and niece, Hallel: “So proud of my amazing sister and niece for their ballsout civil disobedience. Ur the tits #womenofthewall.”"
Boko Haram|Nigeria|Chad|Africa|Islamic State|news,2016-01-31T14:02:45,guardian,Afp In Maiduguri,The killings happened in three incidents across Nigeria and Chad: one in the northern Nigerian village of Dalori and two in Chad,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/31/boko-haram-kills-dozens-village-raid-nigeria-say-survivors,More than 50 feared dead in Boko Haram attacks,en,world|africa,,"The killings happened in three incidents across Nigeria and Chad: one in the northern Nigerian village of Dalori and two in Chad
At least 50 people were feared killed when Boko Haram fighters armed with guns and explosives attacked a village in north-eastern Nigeria. Then three more were killed and 56 wounded in two suicide attacks in Chad, a local security official said.
A spokesman for the Nigerian army said Boko Haram fighters attacked Dalori, which is around 12km (seven miles) from the northern city of Maiduguri, late on Saturday, burning down the village and sending residents fleeing into the bush.
The attack was swiftly condemned by the European Union, which said it was committed to supporting regional African states in the fight against such extremist groups.
Residents and an aid worker said at least 50 people were killed in the Dalori assault, which took place after evening prayers in the mostly Muslim region. Colonel Mustapha Anka, a spokesperson for the army, said the assailants arrived “in two cars and on motorcycles, they opened fire then set light to homes.” Three female suicide bombers who had initially tried to mingle with the villagers “were intercepted, then blew themselves up,” he said.
The assailants also tried to penetrate a camp for people displaced by the Boko Haram insurgency just outside the village but were repelled by troops. Villagers said they fled into the bush when the assailants entered Dalori.
“We were seated outside our home shortly after the Isha prayer when we heard gunshots and within a few minutes the invaders had arrived,” said Malam Masa Dalori, a community leader.
“They came in Golf saloon cars and began to shoot sporadically. Many people ran to the bush including myself. When we came back in the morning the entire community had been razed. At least 50 people were killed, and there are many people wounded.”
Mallam Hassan, another villager, gave a similar account. “I lost an uncle in the attack. But I thank God I escaped with my children,” he said. An aid worker who did not want to be named, also put the number of dead at more than 50, saying the bodies had been taken to hospital.
Maiduguri, about 90 miles from the southern shores of Lake Chad, has a population of 2.6 million, more than half of whom are refugees. Known for being the birthplace of the Boko Haram movement, Maiduguri has been hit by several attacks in recent months as militants have tried to retake the city from which they were pushed three years ago.
In the Lake Chad region, which borders Nigeria as well as Chad, Cameroon and Niger, suicide bombers struck two Chadian villages killing three people, a local security official said.
In the first attack, a bomber on a motorcycle blew himself up in Guie village, killing one person and injuring 32, while the second attack in the village of Miterine killed two and wounded 24, he said.
Nigeria, Chad, Benin, Niger and Cameroon have formed a coalition to fight Boko Haram, comprising 8,700 soldiers, police and civilians. In response Boko Haram has launched cross-border attacks from northern Nigeria on neighbouring countries.
The EU issued a statement condemning the attacks and reiterated the bloc’s commitment to provide €50m (£38m) “to assist countries of the region to fight terrorism”. “The EU remains committed to providing a comprehensive range of political, development and humanitarian support to Nigeria and the region in tackling this threat and in ensuring the sound development of the region,” it said.
Despite claims late last year by President Muhammadu Buhari that Nigeria had “technically” won the war against Boko Haram, the group has kept up a string of attacks. The group, which seeks a hardline Islamic state in northern Nigeria, has killed around 17,000 people and forced more than 2.6 million to flee their homes since 2009."

Working out which of several simultaneous rallies actually contained the future occupant of the White House was less easy, however, as voters in the state prepare to launch the nationwide process of picking Republican and Democratic nominees on Monday amid unusually tight primary races in both parties.
Trump leads and Sanders falls in key Des Moines Register Iowa caucus poll Read more
Just before the last-minute crescendo of campaigning began, a highly regarded opinion poll by the Des Moines Register newspaper saw Donald Trump retaking the top spot in the Republican race from Ted Cruz, and Hillary Clinton clinging to a narrower lead over Bernie Sanders among Democrats.
But the energy was with Sanders and Cruz on Saturday night at lively rallies that suggested neither challenger was out of their respective race yet.
Sanders drew the biggest crowds as an estimated 5,000 supporters descended on the University of Iowa in Iowa City to hear the Vermont senator supported by performances from bands including Vampire Weekend and Foster the People.
“The pundits say young people don’t vote,” he told the many students in the audience. “How would you like to make the pundits look dumb on election night?”
Vampire Weekend, who admitted that one of their earlier songs had an inappropriately “nihilistic” theme, were joined on stage at the end of the night by the senator and his wife Jane Sanders for a rousing finale of Woody Guthrie’s This Land is Your Land.
The 1940 folk classic has long been a favourite of Sanders’ and its lyrics chimed poignantly with his cry to seize back American democracy from the billionaire class: “from California to the New York island, from the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters, this land was made for you and me”.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vampire Weekend and Bernie Sanders sing This Land is Your Land.
Earlier, Sanders had sought to manage expectations in an interview with the Guardian, stressing how far his insurgent campaign had come since he first began challenging Clinton from the left.
“What is interesting about Iowa is there are 44 delegates at stake and the truth is I think at the end of the day whether I win or I lose, the number of delegates we each get is going to be like this,” he said, holding forefinger and thumb together to indicate how close this more meaningful measure of success could be even if he loses overall.
“There is a symbolic thing about winning here, which I admit … I want to win here in Iowa and we’ve got a shot,” added Sanders in remarks shortly before the Des Moines Register poll. “But we are in this race to run to the convention. People have underestimated this campaign from day one.”
Half an hour up the road Hillary Clinton was joined by husband Bill and daughter Chelsea at a smaller, though similarly upbeat, event at a high school in Cedar Rapids.

Her warm-up band however was made up of four young men, who told reporters that while they were undecided as caucus-goers, they were inclined to favor Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination.
Two days before the state will hold the first nominating contest of 2016, this embodied in many ways Clinton’s predicament: a struggle to resonate, particularly with young voters who have been drawn to Sanders in droves.
Taking the stage with her husband, Bill, and daughter, Chelsea, Clinton sought to once again drive home the idea that Sanders was merely a shiny object: attractive and principled, but without a realistic plan to achieve the ambitious goals he has pledged to a larger-than-expected grassroots movement.
“I am a progressive that actually likes to make progress. That is what I believe in,” Clinton said before a raucous crowd of 1,100 people. “What we need is a plan and a commitment.”
She was interrupted by a woman who shouted: “And you!”
Bill Clinton made precisely the same point. What the White House needed, he said in warming up the crowd, was a seasoned hand.
With his signature charisma the former president reflected on his wife’s history of advocacy – for children, for women, and for middle and working class Americans.
“Every place she’s ever been she’s made better,” he said. “She always makes something good happen.”
Roles were also reversed in the Republican race where Donald Trump broke with his standard formula of a pumped-up rally for something that looked more like a Saturday night talk show. The billionaire sat on a stage for a softball interview with the Christian evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr.
Rows of the Adler Theater were packed with popcorn-eating spectators, many of whom appeared to have crossed the nearby border with Illinois to see the billionaire former star of The Apprentice.
“This is a movement,” he said in Davenport, on the eastern edge of the state. “Nothing like this has ever happened before.”

The format may have been different, but during the 35-minute show the audience was given a glimpse of the rambling, unscripted monologues that have defined his presidential campaign, one that always seizes on his remarkable poll numbers.
He briefly mentioned the Des Moines Register’s result that he said had made him “very happy”. Trump said he was most heartened by the underlying data in the newspaper’s poll that showed an increase in support from evangelicals. He attributed that to Falwell, president of a deeply Christian college in Virginia and son of one America’s most famous conservative preachers.
The billionaire insisted Falwell was “a man of faith”. “Maybe I’m a little bit not as good as he is in that way,” Trump said. “But I’m good.”
There was a brief interruption, shortly after the Q&A was over and Trump was shaking hands with supporters, from a small crowd of students who broke out in a chant of “Feel The Bern”. It was largely drowned out by a rendition over the loudspeakers of opera singer Pavarotti’s famous rendition of Nessun Dorma.
But in Sioux City, Ted Cruz addressed a packed room of supporters in a community college auditorium with more of the celebrity buzz that surrounds Sanders.

A near-dozen introductory speakers preceded the Texas senator’s appearance. These included two special guests, Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson and conservative talk show host Glenn Beck. Robertson urged attendees to blow duck calls that the campaign had handed out in order to entice Donald Trump, whom he called “Donald Duck” to come debate Cruz.
He was followed by Beck who gave a half-hour stemwinder that included the media personality brandishing George Washington’s personal copy of Don Quixote.

Cruz finally took the stage an hour and half after the scheduled start of the event and soon started to attack Trump for not participating in Thursday’s Republican debate. He noted Trump was “a gentle soul” who was afraid Megyn Kelly might “ask him a hard question – his hair might stand on end”.
Earlier in the week the Texas senator had challenged Trump to show up at Saturday’s event for a “mano a mano” debate. Needless to say Trump did not appear. But that mild ribbing was the full extent to which Cruz went after his rivals at the event. Instead Cruz portrayed himself as the true heir to Ronald Reagan and the only committed conservative in the race. However he struck a far more confrontational tone at a press conference prior to the event.
Speaking to reporters, Cruz went after his two main opponents in brutally direct terms on policy. “A vote for Marco Rubio is a vote for amnesty and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote for Obamacare.”
All four main candidates are expected to continue campaigning through Sunday before slowly winding up ahead of the caucuses at 7pm on Monday."

Trump Jr and his brother, Eric, had been dispatched to rural Iowa to help dispel the notion that their family is more interested in acquiring luxury golf courses than deer antlers.
In contrast to their father, who never had much interest in hunting, the younger Trumps’ enthusiasm for the activity has been well known since 2012, when photographs surfaced of them posing with dead animals after a big game hunt in Zimbabwe.
The billionaire’s sons were snapped posing with an elephant, a leopard, a waterbuck and a crocodile hanging from a tree by a noose. There are, of course, no crocodiles in Iowa, but Trump Jr insisted that “90%” of his hunting was of the traditional American variety.
“From my weekend house I have deer hunting in my backyard – I’m setting up deer stands all summer,” he said, shortly after shooting a third bird from the sky.
He disputed the idea there was a disconnect between plutocratic trophy safari hunts in Africa and folksy pheasant hunts on Iowa farms – and said his big game hunts played an important role in conservation.

“I think a lot of hunters would aspire to do those things. I’ve been fortunate to be able to travel the world and do it,” he said.
The “bigger trips” can be expensive, he said, but there are expeditions that are good value for money.
“There are some Africa trips where you could do a lot, experience a lot, for the price of a decent elk hunt in Colorado.”

The Guardian was invited to watch Trump Jr and his brother shoot the breeze on a farm near Osceola on Friday, following a chance encounter at Des Moines airport.
Don Peay, a prominent hunter-conservationist from Utah, was offloading luggage from the carousel with Jason Hairston, an NFL player turned extreme hunter.
The pair said they were in Iowa on behalf of a newly founded group, Sportsmen for Trump, that intended to tour the state, bringing attention to the hunting bona fides of Trump’s offspring. They offered to introduce a reporter to the Trump sons, to gain an inside glimpse at their lives.
“With Donald Trump Jr and Eric, it’s authentic,” Peay said. “These guys speak the language, they know the gear, they’re hardcore avid hunter conservationists and fishermen.”

For weeks Trump’s nearest rival, Ted Cruz, has been talking disparagingly about the frontrunner’s “New York values”, with all the connotations that carries of city-dwelling liberals out of touch with rural Iowa.
The winners of the last two Republican presidential contests in Iowa – Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee – emphasised their own hunting bona fides in the days leading up to the caucuses.
But hunting and politics can make for dangerous mix. Vice-President Dick Cheney shot a man during a quail hunt in south Texas in 2006, though many other wounds have been self-inflicted – and rhetorical.
In 2012, Mitt Romney was widely ridiculed for claiming he mostly hunted “small varmints, if you will”. In 2004, John Kerry was lampooned for swaggering into an Ohio grocery store and asking awkwardly: “Can I get me a hunting license here?”
Wielding a gun on a pheasant farm is one gamble that Donald Trump Sr has been unwilling to risk. Instead, he has delegated such duties to his two sons. Their tour of Iowa is being coordinated by Peay, who is filming behind-the-scenes hunting moments with the brothers and uploading them to YouTube.
It is all intended to say to Iowa’s estimated 220,000 hunters that while the Republican frontrunner may be a Manhattan real estate mogul, his sons sure know how to gut a fish.

Driving through frozen cornfields to the hunting lodge, Peay pulled out his iPad to show photographs of hunting expeditions with Cheney and Romney. There was also an image of a beaming Donald Trump Jr, in a distant corner of the Alaskan wilderness, with the antlers of a mountain caribou strapped to his back.
“When you go on these hunting trips – say you go to Alaska on a dall sheep hunt – you live out of a little two-man tent,” Peay said. He nodded toward a derelict building in a field. “If you saw a barn like that, that would be the Taj Mahal.”
The Trump family does, in fact, have its own Taj Mahal – a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, that is just one part of a sprawling property empire that has given the two brothers and their sister, Ivanka, access to a fortune unimaginable to most Iowans.
Not that that appears to matter to voters in the state. It is, perhaps, one of the most intriguing facts of this election that a billionaire property magnate touring the country in a private jet with gold-plated seats has come to be known as a champion of the working poor.
The Trump brothers are careful to avoid the impression that they are snobbish or otherwise dismissive of ordinary folk. They refer to their grandfather on their mother’s side, who introduced them to hunting, as a “blue-collar guy” from communist Czechoslovakia, and their father as “a blue-collar guy with a big balance sheet”.
Trump Jr mentioned three times that he was sleeping on the couch of a friend, Doug Hurley, who is an Iowa state police officer.

When a reporter complained his hands were cold, Trump Jr leaned forward and offered his gloves. He later offered to remove the breast meat from the same reporter’s pheasant, before adding: “I don’t know if I’ll do it on video, or you’ll turn me into some sort of mass butcher.”
Friends of the Trump brothers insist that unlike in Romney and Kerry’s case, there is nothing inauthentic about the brothers’ love of hunting. Yet as with all campaign politics, there was also an element of choreography.
It turned out the New York Times and Washington Post had also been invited to the supposedly private hunt – along with CNN, whose anchor, Jake Tapper, did the brothers’ job for them by introducing them with their own talking points.
“You’re showing Iowans that even though you’re well-to-do New Yorkers, this is part of your culture,” he said."

When Sampriti Bhattacharyya read about a controversial US Navy scheme in which dolphins try to locate sea mines she realised the true potential of the robot she was working on.
Bhattacharyya’s underwater device, about the size of a football, had been developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a tool to detect cracks or splits in nuclear reactor tanks. When Bhattacharyya saw that dolphins were being used to detect mines and locate equipment lost underwater, a world of possibilities opened up – among them mapping the ocean floor or scanning the hull of ships for contraband.
“That made me realise that my robot could be very useful. It is so cheap and easy to make, I could actually make a bunch of them and they could spread out and scan ship hulls,” says the Indian engineer.
The innovators: water mills a boon for green households Read more
Bhattacharyya is developing the prototype of an underwater drone which she hopes will provide a cheap way to map vast swaths of the ocean and chart the underwater landscape.
The drones, named Evie (Ellipsoidal Vehicle for Inspection and Exploration), could also be used to search for plane wreckage, such as in the case of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, she says.
The drone, from Bhattacharyya’s company Hydroswarm, uses a series of jets to propel itself through the water and manoeuvre in different directions. It includes a battery and various interchangeable sensors depending on what task the drone is carrying out.
It could plug in electronics for monitoring the quality of water or for measuring pollution from an oil spill. “It is a platform where you can plug and play any kinds of sensors that you want,” she says. “It is very much like an aerial drone.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Hydroswarm sea drone and its inventor Sampriti Bhattacharyya. Photograph: Hydroswarm
Cameras can also be installed, although they will only work where natural light illuminates the water. Below that point, ultrasound sensors can be used to return images. The first drones will be able to travel up to 250m (820ft) below the surface, according to Bhattacharyya, whose aims to deepen the search in later models.
The drones are being designed to work either individually or as a group, she says, and will be able to communicate with each other. A group of the drones all individually fitted with hydrophones – microphones that can detect soundwaves underwater – could be used to scan sections of the seabed. This swarm of devices would be a more cost-effective and practical approach than using larger and more expensive autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), robots which travel underwater.
“I was thinking that we don’t have the technology to find a massive 747 in the ocean and if you break down the physics of the problem, all you are searching for is a ping [from the black box]. And if you break it down further all you need to hear the ping is a cheap hydrophone,” she says.
“Why not have a network of distributed hydrophones over a large area that can all sync. Each of them has their own ID and location. If I hear a ping after a transmission, they all rise up. If any of them have heard it, they upload it [the details] to a satellite and you know where the ping is coming from.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hydroswarm’s Prototype Demo Reel.
Her principle focus for the drones is to map the ocean floor, an area which is largely undetailed at present. In 2014, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California published a map of the ocean floor with a resolution of 5km per pixel, using satellites to detail the landscape including large underwater mountains and ridges. More detailed maps made using ship sonar systems have mapped between 10% and 15%, about the size of Africa.
Bhattacharyya says the drones could also help identify areas populated by particular fish, or plot dying coral reefs.
“We know less about the ocean than we do about the moon’s surface. What I want to do is make a whole map of the ocean,” she says.
Her ultimate ambition, though, is to map the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world’s oceans and found in the western Pacific. But at 11km deep, the Mariana Trench is many times deeper than the maximum range of the early drone models.
The drones are still being tested in labs and Bhattacharyya admits she will have many hurdles in front of her if she wants to launch Evie on the market in 18 months. “Most of us don’t know much about the ocean and there will be a lot of new difficulties we have no idea how to deal with; that we will have to encounter when we put it in the middle of the ocean.”
A consumer version of the drone is also planned. It will operate in a similar manner to aeriel drones currently on the market which can film the user from a distance, used often by skiers when skiing or in ground-controlled aerial photography. Bhattacharyya estimates these will cost between £700 ($1,000) and £1,000 ($1,500).

But they counter that the firm is ducking its liabilities
When 21-year-old Nathaniel Shaughnessy needed to find flexible paid work, he took a courier job with fast-food delivery firm Deliveroo, and for two years biked take-away meals from restaurants to customers. In February, the Deliveroo-branded food box that clipped to the back of his bike snapped off and he was given a second-hand backpack with a broken zip as a replacement. He was told that he would have to wait until September for a new one, but when the time came to collect it, he learned that the rules had changed and workers are expected to fund replacements themselves. Under the new policy recruits are expected to pay for everything at the outset. A backpack and insulating bag cost £60.
“If anyone’s equipment breaks after six months they are expected to work the equivalent of the next 13 deliveries for nothing, just for the privilege of having the kit to do the job,” says Shaughnessy. “I can only imagine what this must be like for those for whom Deliveroo is their primary source of income.”
Shaughnessy’s grievance echoes that of dozens of other riders who claim the company’s practices deprive them of basic rights. Riders are classed as self-employed contractors who are not entitled to protections granted to employees and “workers” – the latter being an employment classification that carries the right to the national minimum wage, union recognition and holiday pay.
Deliveroo accused of 'painting a false picture' at work tribunal Read more
Last week, a tribunal ruled that Deliveroo riders in north London were not entitled to basic employment rights because they are not “workers”. The case was brought in May by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to force the firm to accept the collective bargaining rights of its members. But in its ruling, the Central Arbitration Committee, which oversees collective bargaining law, concluded that Deliveroo couriers are self-employed because they have a right to ask a substitute to perform a job for them. By law, anyone with the right to do this is classed as self-employed, and self-employed workers aren’t entitled to collective bargaining rights.
Critics claim Deliveroo manipulated the system to duck its liabilities. It changed its contract to include this crucial “substitution clause” just 11 days before the CAC hearing. The company says that it regularly updates its contracts “to ensure that they reflect the reality of how riders work”.
But Annie Powell, a solicitor at Leigh Day which launched the latest legal challenge, says: “We argue that the only reason they brought in the new contract was to defeat the union’s case. The ‘substitute rule’ means that even if you don’t want, or plan, to appoint anyone else to cover for you, the fact that the clause exists in a contract means you count as self-employed and lose basic rights. The law needs to change.”
The charges for essential kit were added to the contract at the same time. Again, Deliveroo insists this was to benefit its couriers who can now use non-branded items, allowing them to work for other companies between jobs. “They only buy what they need, so if they already have protective clothing, lights and helmet, they only have to buy the backpack and thermal bag,” it says.

The union has described the treatment, as evidenced by Shaughnessy, as callous and disrespectful. “They routinely exercise unilateral control to change the terms on which they engage their workforce,” says Jim Benfield, a Deliveroo rider and secretary of the Courier and Logistics branch of the IWGB.
Shaughnessy claims that riders are often unable to earn their dues because regular app outages prevent them from signing on for assigned shifts; the driver support team is frequently uncontactable; and payments are often miscalculated in Deliveroo’s favour. “There have been times when I’ve worked four shifts in a week doing over 20 deliveries and received the pay equivalent for less than one shift,” he says. Payments often have to be challenged after being miscalculated.
The new requirement for workers to purchase mandatory equipment was the last straw for Shaughnessy who quit rather than fork out.
Another policy change, introduced last month, means that riders on hourly rates can no longer work the same ongoing shift patterns to guarantee an income. Instead, they have to compete for available hours at the start of each week with those Deliveroo classes as “high performing” and who have priority. Hours are also now capped at 55 a week. Deliveroo says the change is in response to rider feedback. “It provides greater certainty over earnings by accurately matching rider supply with customer demand,” it says. “Riders can book sessions in advance, cancel at any time or choose to turn up at the last minute.”
Deliveroo wins right not to give riders minimum wage or holiday pay Read more
Riders, however, claim that the cap and the unpredictability has left them out of pocket. Sergio Ramos, a rider in London, reckons he has lost £125 a week. “I used to work 10 hours a day, seven days a week,” he says. “Now I’m not allowed to block book more than 55.”
“Block bookings” are those made on the day that available hours for the following week are released – and the cap only applies to them. Riders can top up more sessions after that, but there is no guarantee any will be left.
Deliveroo drivers who work shifts are paid £6 an hour (£7 in London) plus £1 a delivery. Those who prefer to work ad hoc earn £3.75 per delivery rising to £4.50 in rural areas. The minimum wage for over-25s is £7.50, excluding expenses.
“Out of that money I have to pay for motorbike maintenance and equipment and £1,300 a year for courier insurance,” says Ramos, 40, who has four young children and reckons he’s left with £7.50 an hour before tax. “Last year I broke my hip while on a delivery and was off work for eight weeks with no income.”
Annie Powell says that some of her clients earn “substantially” less than the minimum wage. “One was more than £500 below the threshold for two months’ work,” she says. “Our argument is that these riders are controlled, managed and disciplined by Deliveroo and clearly do not carry out their own delivery businesses, as Deliveroo argues.”
Deliveroo says that average hourly earnings work out at £9.50 and that if the app, which details available jobs, stops working, riders on hourly pay are credited with the equivalent of 2.5 deliveries. It claims its workforce would be deprived of vital autonomy if it was given employment status as “85% of riders say that flexibility is what they value most”.
It adds: “This enables them to work when and where they want, and for how long they want. We want employment law to be updated to allow us to offer riders benefits such as sick and injury pay, without limiting the flexibility they value.”
Deliveroo boss Will Shu gives himself 22.5% rise amid battle over riders' pay Read more
The need for new legislation is a “fiction” according to a parliamentary review, which concluded that profit – not flexibility – is the motive for using a self-employed workforce.
The 21st-century phenomenon of the “gig economy” has, critics claim, undone a century of progress and reintroduced sweatshop conditions. The IWGB had hoped that a tribunal ruling forcing Deliveroo to recognise union membership, would haul it into the new millennium.
Last week that hope proved a forlorn one. But experts reckon the CAC ruling should not affect the latest legal challenge for fair pay. They can take heart from Uber’s recent defeat in a similar case brought by its drivers.
FOR AND AGAINST SHORT-TERM WORK
The so-called “gig economy” is a sector which relies on short-term contracts or freelancers. Instead of a regular salary, those who work in it get paid per job – or gig. Classed as independent contractors, they are not entitled to the national minimum wage or sickness, holiday or redundancy pay, and don’t have guaranteed working hours.
Supporters claim it allows people to choose their own working patterns, while businesses are spared statutory staff overheads. An estimated five million people work this way, and the Office of Budget Responsibility forecasts that in 2020-21 it will cost £3.5bn in lost taxes.
A government-sponsored review has recommended that firms with a “controlling and supervisory” relationship with workers, such as Uber and Deliveroo, should have to pay a full range of benefits, including national insurance contributions.

This incredible natural spectacle, along with multiple other geothermal features and the one to two thousand earthquakes that occur every year, are just some of the signs that this region is sitting atop a whopping great volcano. The last super-eruption was nearly 640,000 years ago, but gentle swelling of the ground indicates that the underlying magma chamber is refilling, and Yellowstone will erupt again one day.
Yellowstone national park: scientists discover huge magma chamber Read more
Most volcanoes occur at the boundary between two tectonic plates, but Yellowstone is unusual because it lies centrally on the North America plate. Many geologists believe that is because Yellowstone sits on top of a “hot spot” – a plume of warm mantle rising up from the edge of the Earth’s core. Hot spots create chains of volcanoes (like the Hawaiian island chain) as the tectonic plate above glides over it.
However, new research, published in Geophysical Research Letters, makes the hot-spot theory seem unlikely for Yellowstone. Recent images of the underlying mantle show clear anomalies between 400 and 1,000km deep, thought to be the remnants of an ancient ocean plate. By modelling the way the mantle might flow around this ancient plate, Tiffany Leonard and Lijun Liu from the University of Illinois have shown that this sinking slab would block the heat and get in the way of any mantle plume.
Unfortunately their model doesn’t provide any other explanations for the presence of Yellowstone; quite why this vast volcano exists remains a mystery."

February has probably our best evening skies of the year and, this time around, one extra day in which to enjoy them. Orion is unmistakable in the S in the mid-evening as Capella in Auriga shines near the zenith and Sirius, the Dog Star, nips at Orion’s heels, blazing and twinkling like no other star in our night sky. It owes its status to its distance of only 8.6 light years – push it as far away as the closest of Orion’s seven main stars and we would need binoculars to spot it.
As Orion reaches the meridian look to the E for the first naked-eye planet of the night. Jupiter lies in SE Leo, some 22° below-left of Regulus, and is more than twice as bright as Sirius as it climbs into the S five hours after our map times. February sees it brighten a little from mag –2.4 to –2.5 as it approaches from 694 million to 665 million km. Telescopes show its diameter grow to 44.3 arcsec, only 0.1 arc shy of its size at opposition in early March. By the 29th it rises barely 30 minutes after sunset and is visible for the rest of the night.
Jupiter is the brightest object in the west sky just before dawn and is the leader in a chain of planets that stretch for more than 100° low across Britain’s sky towards Venus and Mercury which hug our SE horizon in the twilight. Despite some recent claims to the contrary, this is not particularly striking and it is not a planetary alignment, since that term applies when planets appear close together in the sky.
The first planet in the line after Jupiter is Mars, although Spica in Virgo stands between them. Mars lies below the Moon and close to the double star Zubenelgenubi in Libra in the S on the 1st and brightens from mag 0.8 to 0.3 this month as it slides eastwards towards Saturn, similar in brightness at mag 0.6 to 0.5. The latter stands 8° above-left of the red supergiant Antares in Scorpius and appears below-left of the Moon on the 3rd.
Mars swells from 7 to 9 arcsec in diameter this month while Saturn is 16 arcsec across, set within wide-open 36 arcsec rings – a superb sight.
Venus is brilliant at mag –4.0 but rises only some 90 minutes before the Sun on the 1st and 40 minutes on the 29th. Mercury, much fainter near mag 0.0, lies a few degrees below-left of Venus and is very difficult from our latitudes. Both are below the Moon on the 6th.

Terry Wogan|Radio|Radio 2|BBC|Radio industry|Ireland|obituaries,2016-01-31T14:05:41,guardian,Dennis Barker,"Hugely popular radio and TV broadcaster loved for the wry sense of humour he brought to his Radio 2 show, Blankety Blank and the Eurovision Song Contest",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/31/terry-wogan,Sir Terry Wogan obituary,en,UK|media,,"With his ready self-deprecation and an ability to mock inoffensively, Terry Wogan, who has died aged 77 after suffering from cancer, was for several decades one of the most popular personalities on both radio and television in Britain – in his words, a jobbing broadcaster. When he was in charge of the television game show Blankety Blank for four years from 1979, audiences exceeded 20 million. His weekday breakfast programme on Radio 2 (1972-84 and 1993-2009) reached 8 million listeners. And quite certainly some of the many millions who watched the Eurovision Song Contest, which he covered on radio and then TV from the early 1970s to 2008, did so more for his facetious commentaries than for the music.
Wogan began his broadcasting career in his native Ireland, but secured his status as a British audience-magnet with his eponymous television chat show, which ran for up to three times a week for a decade from 1982. His many guests included Rock Hudson, Dolly Parton, Raquel Welch, Lee Marvin, Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft.

All his shows, from playing music to radio listeners at breakfast time to television in the evening, were exploitations of a personality that managed to be reassuring and yet also sharp-witted. With Wogan there was banter, but it was not always bland. And he was no pushover to those in power. When in 1975 BBC officials told him to tone down his quips at the expense of the director general, he immediately inflated them with even more surreal splendour: “I have the ultimate sanction. I can walk out.”
Born in Limerick, Terry was the son of Michael, who worked in a branch of the grocers Leverett and Frye, and Rose. He grew up with the BBC radio Light Programme and its comedy shows.
At the age of five he went to Ferrybank prep school, which was run by nuns, but after 10 minutes walked home, and soon decided he was an atheist. When he was nine he went to Crescent College, Limerick, which was “not really nightmarish but the end of innocence”, where he was taught by Jesuits. At 15, as a result of his father’s promotion, the family moved to Dublin, where Terry attended Belvedere college, alma mater of James Joyce.
As a child Terry tended to withdraw from any group after a certain time, and admitted to being rather the same as an adult. During the various runs of the Wogan television chat show he later declared that, for him, the high point of the evening was dinner at home with his wife, Helen (nee Joyce). Having seen himself as “a well-behaved, conventional little mother’s boy, afraid of his own shadow”, once he had left Limerick he did not return until he was a star of the newly formed Irish radio and television service, Raidío Telefís Éireann (RTÉ), and was judging beauty contests.

Though he had vaguely wanted to be a journalist, his first jobs were with branches of the Royal Bank of Ireland. After four years with the bank, he saw an advertisement in the Irish Independent: the radio service wanted announcer-newsreaders. There was a training course of five evenings a week and 10,000 applicants, but Wogan had found “the only thing I could be good at”. He especially relished a turn of duty that came round every four or five weeks. This was hospital requests, through which he discovered that ad-libbing from postcards and letters in between records was something he could do easily.

This ease became his trademark. When RTÉ opened its television service on New Year’s Eve 1961, he was an obvious recruit, and soon found his face so irritatingly famous that he could no longer go into pubs. He began to form the view that, unlike radio, where listeners got to know and cherish their favourite personalities, television was instant fame that was instantly forgotten the moment a face disappeared. However, the television quiz show Jackpot, which he chaired, topped the ratings.
When he sent a tape of his radio work to the BBC Light Programme, the assistant head of the gramophone records department, Mark White – who was to become a mentor – offered him the chair of Midday Spin, a half-hour selection of records, which was made and broadcast from London, with his own commentary being inserted from RTÉ in Dublin.
Alternating between Dublin and London was congenial to him, but not to RTÉ. When he began Late Night Extra on Wednesdays for BBC Radio 1 and 2, flying back to Dublin afterwards, RTÉ told him to concentrate on his work for them – or else. Wogan opted for the “or else”; his first appearance on British television consisting of presenting a beauty contest with David Vine in 1973. He then took over from Peter West for seven seasons of Come Dancing.
In 1974 he launched his first chat show, Wogan’s World, for BBC Midlands from Pebble Mill. After he had started presenting his Wogan chat show from the Shepherd’s Bush Empire, a former variety theatre in west London, he took a break from breakfast radio. Not all guests were easy: George Best came on in a “footless” condition, and he found David Icke “a ranting demagogue”, but kept his good humour. In 1978 Wogan was his usual ironic self when he appeared on Top of the Pops singing the Cornish folk song The Floral Dance. Surprisingly it reached No 21 in the charts.

Wogan also presented Auntie’s Bloomers (1991-2001), the resurrection of BBC broadcasting fluffs and disasters, leaving when he thought it had no more to offer. By then he was mediating between the corporation and its deeply involved and demanding audience on Points of View (1999-2007).
For UKTV Gold he presented Wogan Now and Then from 2006, and for BBC1 he looked back over the previous 40 years in a two-part programme, Wogan’s Ireland (2011). Last year he teamed up with London cabbie Mason McQueen for Terry and Mason’s Great Food Trip, a culinary tour around Britain shown in half-hour episodes on BBC2. On Radio 2, he was back with a Sunday morning programme, from 2010 until last November.

During his days with Blankety Blank, the Christmas show of 1979 topped the seasonal ratings. He regarded the show as his lucky emblem, since it led to his receiving 10 TV Times awards in succession as most popular television personality; he then asked not to be entered again so that someone else could have a chance. He also had numerous Sony and Variety Club of Great Britain awards, and in 2010 the Television and Radio Industries Club gave him a lifetime achievement award. When Radio 2 turned 40 in 2007, he was voted its Ultimate Icon.
A succession of cheerful books included two memoirs, Is it Me? (2000) and Mustn’t Grumble (2006). The Little Book of Common Sense (2014) shared some general observations along the lines of Radio 2’s Pause for Thought. He was appointed OBE in 1997 and KBE in 2005. Dual citizenship made it possible for him to use the title Sir.
In addition to his regular shows over the years, he was on ready call for the “big occasion” and presented the 1976 and 1984 Olympic games.

Wogan was never touched by scandal. No one had an anecdote that showed him as ill-natured. One of the rare occasions on which he showed that he could put a heavy boot in when required came after a critic in the Times savaged his annual Children in Need fundraising programme (which he presented every year from 1980) by contending that “November is short of ersatz national days, except for the annual BBC Children in Need atrocity, an event better calculated than any other to make me contemplate self-harm.”
Wogan, who was passionately protective of good causes, retorted in Mustn’t Grumble: “Don’t contemplate it, chum, do it. Start with your heart, if you can find it.” He was patently on genuinely easy terms with his own.
He is survived by Helen, whom he married in 1965, two sons and a daughter. Another daughter died in infancy.

Pop and rock|San Francisco|obituaries,2016-01-31T16:19:22,guardian,Adam Sweeting,Leading light in Jefferson Airplane and San Francisco’s Summer of Love,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/31/paul-kantner,Paul Kantner obituary,en,culture|music,,"The music of Jefferson Airplane was a key ingredient of the psychedelic aura shrouding San Francisco in the late 1960s, and the guitarist, songwriter and vocalist Paul Kantner, who has died aged 74, was one of the group’s chief architects. “Paul was the catalyst that brought the whole thing together,” said the Airplane’s guitarist Jorma Kaukonen. “The band would not have been what it was without him.”
After some early personnel changes, the classic Jefferson Airplane lineup announced itself definitively with 1967’s Surrealistic Pillow album. Proving that San Francisco’s new psychedelic sound, with its adventurous musicianship and free-flowing arrangements, could be both groundbreaking and commercial, the album spent a year on the Billboard 200 and produced two Top 10 classics in the US, Somebody to Love and White Rabbit, the most successful singles of the band’s career. The Airplane, with their anti-authority stance, espousal of drug culture and communal ideals, then cemented themselves at the epicentre of the Summer of Love with a stirring performance at the Monterey pop festival.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jefferson Airplane perform Somebody to Love in 1967
They enjoyed further album chart success in 1967 with After Bathing at Baxter’s (much of which was written by Kantner), and the following year with Crown of Creation, on which Kantner composed the title song. In August 1969 they played at the Woodstock festival and in November of the same year they released Volunteers. This was their most fully rounded album, including militant calls to arms in Kantner’s We Can Be Together and the title song Volunteers, as well as thunderous rock workouts in Hey Fredrick and the ecological flag-waver Eskimo Blue Day.
However, the last days of the 60s signalled the disintegration of the Airplane. They ended 1969 with an appearance at the disastrous Altamont festival, and the album Long John Silver (1972) marked the end of the band. Afterwards Kantner and the Airplane’s Grace Slick formed another group, Jefferson Starship, which also proved to be a great success.
Born in San Francisco, Paul was the son of Paul Sr, a travelling salesman and Cora (nee Fortier), who died when he was eight. His father sent him away to be educated by the Christian Brothers and then to a Jesuit school in Santa Clara. Paul much preferred the “liberal and forward-thinking” outlook of the former to the strict religiosity of the latter, and later adopted the slogan “question authority” as a mantra. However, this would not preclude him from taking an autocratic approach to his bandmates when he considered it necessary.
While studying at Santa Clara University and then San Jose State College he taught himself guitar and banjo, and set out to make a splash on the San Francisco folk circuit. Jefferson Airplane were formed in 1965, after the singer Marty Balin had met Kantner at the San Francisco folk club The Drinking Gourd. The original line-up included vocalist Signe Toly Anderson, Kaukonen, drummer Jerry Peloquin and a bluegrass-inclined double bass player, Bob Harvey. Their manager, Matthew Katz, bathetically dubbed their music “fo-jazz” (a mixture of folk and jazz).
Regular live performing soon brought changes, with Jack Casady coming in on bass – he was one of the most inventive and admired practitioners of the era – and the drum stool commandeered first by Skip Spence and then Spencer Dryden. In 1966 they released their debut album, Jefferson Airplane Takes Off, and sacked Katz. Two months later Anderson quit and was promptly replaced by Grace Slick, the privately educated daughter of an investment banker who had been singing with another San Francisco band, The Great Society.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jefferson Airplane play their song Volunteers at the Woodstock festival in 1969
The next three years saw the group reaching their peak, but by 1970 in-fighting was breaking out, and by 1971 both Dryden and Balin had left. In 1970 Kantner had signalled a possible new future for himself by embarking on a side project that led to a concept album, Blows Against the Empire, recorded with an ad hoc group of musicians he called Jefferson Starship and revealing his fascination with science fiction writers such as Arthur C Clarke and Robert Heinlein.
When the Airplane folded, Kantner went on to record a pair of albums with Slick, who by then had become his partner, and with whom he had a daughter, China. Then he made Jefferson Starship into a full-time affair, and between 1974 and 1984 the group had five Top 20 US albums in succession, with 1975’s Red Octopus hitting No 1 and delivering the No 3 hit Miracles.
Kantner quit after their 1984 album, Nuclear Furniture, declaring himself unhappy with the group’s too-commercial direction. The band continued as Starship, best remembered for their 1985 chart-topper We Built This City, while Kantner went on to record a one-off album in 1986 with Casady and Balin as the KBC Band. In 1989 he was involved in a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and album, and in 1992 he reignited Jefferson Starship. The band was still a going concern at his death, and their most recent album was Jefferson’s Tree of Liberty (2008), mostly comprising traditional folk and protest songs.
He is survived by China and by two sons, Alexander, from his relationship with his former partner Cynthia Bowman, and Gareth, with Karen Seltenrich.

BBC|Media Monkey|ITV channel|Television industry|Radio 1|Sunday Times|blogposts,2016-01-29T00:00:00,guardian,,"The BBC launches resilience workshops for staff facing the chop, Apple’s Zayn Malik scoop, and you’ve got male at ITV News",https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2016/jan/31/zane-lowe-tom-bradby-donald-trump,"Media Monkey’s Diary: Zane Lowe, Tom Bradby and Donald Trump",en,UK|media,,"• For BBC toilers wondering where the further £550m of cuts will come from when Tony Hall announces them in the spring, good news! The Beeb may be swinging the axe but it is also providing staff with some medically-backed Resilience Workshops. Stressed types asked to take on even more work as numbers go down can sign up for them now. According to the BBC Academy’s website: “The ability to be resilient tends to be particularly relevant for people during organisational change, which, as in many organisations, continues to be a key feature of working life at the BBC.” The initiative looks cannily timed: when the DG reveals who’s for the chop, once-gibbering employees will in theory have built up the mental toughness to deal with it.
• Radio 1 isn’t bitter that Zayn Malik gave his first interview since quitting One Direction to Zane Lowe, its former star DJ, on Apple’s rival Beats 1 station. If a BBC show was interviewing Malik, “we might ask the right questions, or even a difficult question and we would do something funnier than anyone else”, says a defiant Ben Cooper, Radio 1 controller. Surely industry rumours that Apple paid Malik for the exclusive are wide of the mark?
• Since ITV’s News at Ten switched to a solo anchor, its on-screen team have been nicknamed the Bradby Bunch, but perhaps that should be Bradby’s Blokes? Even in a Pesto-free edition on Thursday, for example, the reporters were John Ray, John Irvine, Dan Rivers, James Mates, Robert Moore, Neil Connery, Joel Hills, Martin Geissler and Paul Davies; only a brief visit by Libby Wiener to the lonely glass desk of Tom Bradby (who rose, it should be remembered, at the expense of a male-female duo) prevented it being a stag do, and men also predominated when experts were interviewed. BBC defector Allegra Stratton clearly can’t arrive too soon; but while she will alter the numbers slightly, she may still find parallels between her situation and the gender balance when Snow White was lodging with the seven dwarfs.
• Though Bradby is not to blame – the prizes’ time-frame largely pre-dates his installation as solo “newscaster” – the Royal Television Society’s journalism awards later this month are set to prove memorable in the wrong way for the new ITV News regime which elevated him: in particular the Daily News Programme of the Year category, won by ITV last year, where this time it hasn’t even been shortlisted - Channel 4 News, Sky News at Five and the BBC’s “Huw’s at Ten” are the contenders. Pointedly, too, Julie Etchingham, sidelined in ITV’s revamp, is shortlisted for Network Presenter of the Year with C4’s Matt Frei and the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire.
• Monkey is concerned that broadcasters have suddenly become shy about using the word “celebrity”, as if in denial about their reliance on them. Participants in The Great Sport Relief Bake Off, it’s true, are eagerly called celebs - but then all kinds of rules are set aside when a show is for charity. When it comes to the more everyday The Real Marigold Hotel, the taboo is clearly in force: it boasts “a cast of well-known senior citizens”, “an all-star cast of eight famous senior citizens”, babbles the publicity. And the ban and the blushes have spread to Channel 4, where the More4 heritage series Discovering Britain (in which all the presenters are celebrities) is coyly said to boast “a host of familiar faces”.
• Fox deserves credit for sticking to its guns by retaining Donald Trump’s bete noire, Megyn Kelly, as moderator, thereby as good as ensuring that Trump would boycott last week’s final debate before the Iowa primary. But it could have been wittier and tougher in its response to the tycoon’s tantrum (it simply lined up the other contenders behind lecterns, with no gap or equivalent of “empty chairing”); perhaps by imitating Have I Got News for You’s reaction when Roy Hattersley pulled out, with a Trump-appropriate item on the unused lectern instead of the British quiz show’s tub of lard. Monkey favours a guinea pig with straggly yellow hair. Any better suggestions?"

Or such, anyway, is the view of Andrew Losowsky – a journalist who, as project lead on the Coral Project, is helping to shape the future of reader interaction.
Losowsky – whose venture is a collaboration between the Washington Post, the New York Times and Mozilla – acknowledges that this view may be a little hyperbolic. But it is one that many publishers share in the current divisive media landscape, where commenting can either be seen as the best way to interact with your audience or an affront to journalism.
“The word ‘comments’ has come to mean toxic space, harassment, overwhelmingly young white male, a lot of abuse, people showing no respect, no compassion and no empathy,” says Losowsky, who believes publishers should think of comments as “contributions” to escape the negative connotations of the word.

John Doran, editor of British music website the Quietus, which recently decided to temporarily turn off commenting on the majority of its articles, compares his experience with comments to battling graffiti. “Imagine for a second you own a shop and the first thing you do every morning at 6.30am is to go outside and scrub a load of deeply offensive and unpleasant graffiti off the front before you can open up.”
The decision to turn comments off was, Doran explains, largely down to the logistics of running an independent music website, and he believes most commenters on the Quietus do benefit the site. But he acknowledges there is a darker side to commenting, one familiar to most people who have ventured beneath the line. “Ideally I’d genuinely like the comments feature left on but I just grew tired of having to be constantly vigilant for occasionally really vicious and libellous homophobia, sexism and racism etc.”
The Quietus now plans to introduce “a different kind of commenting function” this summer. In doing so, it will join the legions of publishers experimenting with new ways of dealing with comments. Potential solutions fall anywhere on the spectrum from charging readers $18 (£13) a month to comment on articles (at Jewish online magazine Tablet), to a 24-hour waiting period on account registration (and therefore commenting) on the games website Polygon.
At the technological forefront of this battle is the Coral Project, which is developing open-source solutions for community involvement on news sites that should allow media companies to spend less time cleaning up negative comments and more time pulling out positive contributions.
The Coral Project’s first product, set for testing this month, is a “listening tool” which will help publishers identify trustworthy commenters based on a series of customisable metrics. “You could say, ‘Show me the people who get the most recommends within the last six months on the sports section, only for comments that are longer than two sentences, on the subject of cricket,’ and then see who comes out,” Losowsky explains.
Publishers can then use this information to identify top comments and involve the best contributors in their work. Readers will also be given better control over the comments they see, with the ability, for example, to remove certain commenters from their stream.
Most of these ideas suggest that comments can, eventually, be tamed. And yet those fighting for the future of commenting are in a race against time, as more publishers turn off onsite comments, encouraging readers to express their views through social media instead. Tech website Re/code, Reuters.com and TheWeek.com all took this path towards the end of 2014 and others such as Vice’s Motherboard followed suit over 2015. Re/code founders Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg explained to readers that as social media has grown “the bulk of discussion of our stories is increasingly taking place there, making onsite comments less and less used”.
Swisher, also executive editor of Re/code, says the standard of commenting has improved since the move: “It is more lively and has a back and forth that comments do not.” Tablet editor-in-chief Alana Newhouse agrees. “The effect of charging people to comment has been exactly what we intended – more robust conversation on Facebook, where most of our readers were already telling us they went for civil interaction, and less toxic sludge on our own site.”
That’s all very well. But sending readers to their social media is not without drawbacks. “There is a risk involved in moving comments to social media,” says Gina Masullo Chen, from the University of Texas at Austin, who is writing a book on the future of commenting. “There is evidence that when your Facebook friends are going to see what you say, then it does affect it, making it more civil, but when you shift it [commenting] all the way to social media there is a loss of control.”
Then there’s the problem of context. “A lot of what you see on the comments is many, many times more contextual than what you see on social,” says New York Times community editor Bassey Etim. “On social people are typically reacting to the headline. In the comments people are reacting to the quote in the fourth paragraph.”
So are online comments really on their last legs in 2016? In their current form, maybe, according to most observers. But there is enough innovation in the field to suggest that online reader contributions are here to stay. Media companies may not be exactly blameless in the rise of toxic commenting, given the sometimes aggressively opinionated pieces they run, but Losowsky believes they will overcome the problems around commenting to the benefit of journalism as a whole.
“If journalism is going to remain important, it has to remain relevant; it has to adapt to and understand better the ways in which journalism can be more collaborative, more community-led,” he concludes. “To do that we need a special way of approaching it and we need special tools. And so I’m incredibly positive about the future, in terms of that way of thinking.”
And if you disagree – well, we’ll see you below the line. Ben Cardew is a freelance writer who contributes to the Quietus"
The Guardian|Digital media|National newspapers|Newspapers|Social media|comment,2016-01-29T00:00:00,guardian,Mary Hamilton,"Improving comments does not mean censorship or eliminating criticism, we want to free the voices that struggle to be heard",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/31/comments-audience-censorship-criticism,Online comments: we want to be responsible hosts,en,UK|media,,"Recently, the Guardian took the decision to cut down the number of places where we open comments on stories relating to a few contentious subjects – particularly migration and race. The aim isn’t to stop comments appearing at all, but rather to enable us to manage them more effectively, keep a closer watch on the conversation, feed back what’s being said, and make sure the discussion is constructive and not abusive. We hope it’ll help us to be responsible hosts, essentially.
We expect a great deal of our commenters, and we try to hold them to some specific standards. We want to host conversations where there is a constructive debate, where our audience can help us broaden our journalism with their expertise, their knowledge, their considered thoughts and opinions, and where they can use our site as a platform to make connections with the world and with those around them. It’s not hard to see the value there.
One thing that militates against constructive conversation in the long term is the structure of sites like the Guardian, where commenting is connected primarily to stories, rather than to the commenters. Unlike many social platforms there is no stream, no personalised view that shows you individuals you might wish to form bonds with. Each new comment thread is a new environment, a new forum for collective discussion, and each one develops its own personality and culture – often shaped, for good or ill, by the first few comments. Even within the broader rules and expectations set by the site, the prevailing tone is set by the topic of the piece.
Online comments: is the space below the line too toxic or can they be fixed? Read more
Further complicating the issue is the fact that commenting cultures are very different on different sites – and, often, within them. While every piece is its own space, series and regular content do develop their regular readers – and regular commenters and communities along with them. The Guardian has its crossword community, its gamers, the readers who congregate around Poem of the Week or the Politics liveblogs run by Andrew Sparrow or, in Australia, Katharine Murphy. Similarly, different writers experience different levels of heat and light in the comments on their work. Writers who touch on tricky subjects – race, gender, Israel, migration – or whose work reaches an unexpectedly broad audience can often find themselves on the receiving end of abuse and agenda trolling as well as reasoned debate and criticism.
At their worst, the resulting conversations drive away the commenters who want to speak with moderate voices, because it is those who have an agenda who have the greatest will to stick around. If someone is repeatedly replying to every comment in a thread and refuses to give equal time to opposing views, then even if every response they make is reasonable, the sum total of their actions becomes disruptive to the conversation and very, very difficult to mitigate.
But where there is positivity, constructive criticism, reasonable debate and – crucially – where journalists respond and get involved, there is a huge amount to be gained. Our audience tells us when we get it right, as well as when we get it wrong. They tell us what they want to know more about, they ask us to help you, and they are, so often and so wonderfully, willing to help us flesh out our journalism and benefit from far more experience than we could do alone. The onus is on us to listen, to respond, to make sure we don’t discount their voices, and to do our best to nurture and support those who care about what we do.
In 2006, Jay Rosen described the people formerly known as the audience. He recognised and called out the fact that, online, there is a new balance of power between readers and writers, between the community of journalists and the communities of news consumers. Comments are the place where that balance is constantly in play.
As Murphy writes: “My audience is no longer an abstract commodity, far removed from me and my daily work. It is right beside me, keeping me company, urging me to ask the questions they can’t ask, wanting me to do better, demanding relentlessly that I work for them.”
At their best – when they are respectful, thoughtful, interesting, or constructive – comments make our journalism better. At their worst, they can diminish its impact, reduce its credibility, and harm our writers and their subjects, while making those constructive comments impossible to find or recognise. When we talk about improving the comments, we aren’t just speaking about censorship or eliminating criticism: what we want instead is to free the voices that struggle to be heard, so that we can listen.

Social media|Digital media|Media business|interviews,2016-01-29T00:00:00,guardian,Jasper Jackson,"Chief executive on reinventing a brand, creating content for everyone, and the power of getting serious",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/31/unilad-lads-mags-women-serious,Unilad’s Liam Harrington: ‘We are absolutely not a lads’ mag’,en,UK|media,,"They may have a three-letter noun in common but Unilad chief executive Liam Harrington rejects any comparison to the lads’ mags that dominated 1990s newsstands. “We are absolutely not a lads’ mag,” he says. “Sites like ours are social enterprises that are catering to everyone, as opposed to the lads’ mags, which were catering to the niches.”
With 11.5m likes on Facebook – which Harrington says are split roughly 35:65 female to male – Unilad is not a niche product. In comparison, the Guardian’s Facebook page has 5.2m fans and Mail Online’s 3.4m. The brand regularly features in the top 10 Facebook video publisher lists from analytics firm Newswhip and its most successful video – of a man playing a game called Pie Face with his small son – has been viewed almost 183m times. They are numbers to make traditional media organisations weep.
At the age of 24, Harrington hasn’t had a great deal of management experience (despite his company’s name, he hasn’t been to university either). Prior to founding Unilad he was working in health recruitment and selling T-shirts out of his dad’s garage. He tried and failed at a handful of digital projects, including a student-focused fashion brand, a New Year’s resolution checker and a network of university TV stations.
It wasn’t until he and friend Sam Bentley hit on the idea of reviving an existing brand with a digital footprint that things took off, but their decision to choose Unilad presented some problems. The name was first used in 2010 by student Alex Partridge for a site called Unilad.com, which became infamous for misogynist content with titles such as “How to pull a fresher” and “Lies to get you laid” that seemed to sum up the worst of lad culture. It was closed in 2012 following extensive negative coverage from newspapers including the Guardian, centred on articles accused of promoting sexual violence, though it limped on through 2013 in various guises and kept gaining fans on Facebook. Harrington, usually enthusiastic and articulate, gets visibly uncomfortable when it’s brought up.
He insists that there is “no shared association at all” between the original brand and his version launched in April 2014, which uses the site address Unilad.co.uk. “It’s something we’ve had to deal with, there was a blog around beforehand that wasn’t of the best quality, we had a lot to do with tidying up,” he says. So why choose a name with such negative associations? “It still had the attraction. A lot of people who knew about it, and if a lot of people knew about it, there’s obviously something about it.”
A big part of that something was the more than 300,000 fans its Facebook page had accrued by the time Harrington got involved. He won’t say how they came to take over the Facebook page and there are rumours of a legal tussle with Partridge. Unilad claims there was no copyright to violate on the brand and, when asked if it is involved in legal action, says only that “we don’t comment on legal matters generally”.
Whatever the associations, that notorious Facebook page was the foundation for the new Unilad, and once an employee put them in touch with someone at Facebook who verified it (in return for an appearance on a Rap Battle YouTube channel) things began to take off. “As soon as we were verified – I don’t know the reason why it happened – all our old content was being regurgitated on to the timelines of people.”
At this point much of the content they were posting was still very “lad” heavy, such as January 2015’s “5 On 5 Fighting Is Back And It’s F*cking Brutal”, but a long way from its earlier nastier incarnation.
It wasn’t until Unilad posted about an anti-domestic violence ad by the Salvation Army last March, which used The Dress meme, that Harrington says he realised more serious topics could still be a hit on social media. “It ended up being our most shared article ever. It took off and I was just dumbfounded. I thought ‘This is it, we can now change the way we write our content, we can change the type of content we go for because people will listen’. We were very proud of that, I am very proud of that.”
The Damascene conversion hasn’t done Harrington or Unilad any harm. Though its most obvious competitor, TheLadBible (which was also based on a brand set up by Partridge) has a headstart, particularly on other platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat, Unilad’s 11.5m Facebook likes put it just ahead of TheLadBible’s 11.1m in its core territory. It claims to have moved beyond the original Unilad’s rump of university-aged males to reach a diverse audience of 16- to 30-year-olds, and Harrington claims women are more likely to share and like Unilad posts than men.
Unilad, which has always been self-funded, is trying to build out an advertising operation, though it remains well behind TheLadBible in terms of sophistication and personnel. It charges £12 for a standard display ad on its own site and £20,000 for a branded video which will also run on its social channels, four times as much as the same video posted just to Unilad.co.uk. One of their most recent ads – a stunt for the Robert De Niro film Dirty Grandpa involving an elderly busker singing a rap song on Carnaby Street – not only delivered more than 2.8m views on Unilad’s Facebook page, but was also picked up by the national press and social media.
“Everyone knew it was going to get picked up,” says Harrington. “When you stick an old man in front of a telephone box rapping to Stormzy, you aren’t going to be the only ones filming.
“As soon as you see the first video go up you get in touch and make sure they are crediting the right person, make sure they are pushing it in the right direction.”
Harrington concedes it’s very early days for Unilad’s commercial development. Some of the campaigns sail close to the wind, not always making it completely clear someone has paid, something Harrington insists they will be more careful about after recently hiring an advertising manager from the national press (significantly bumping up the company’s average age in the process).
The branded content is created by the same team of young multiskilled video-makers (Harrington calls them “Predeators” to stand for producers, directors and editors) who are also producing professional quality video for the site that he hopes will help push Unilad further into more worthy issues.
Recent video projects include films on homelessness and a report from migrant camps in Calais, and they have worked with Bite the Ballot to film students visiting parliament to discuss education.
“It’s quite easy to license a funny video and upload it, but it’s a lot harder to go out and create something,” says Harrington.
There’s lighter original content too - during the interview the video team are editing footage shot hours earlier at a morning rave, the kind where drug cocktails are replaced by fruit smoothies and you’re as likely to find someone wearing a suit as fairy wings.
It’s clear the site - and Harrington himself - are seeking respectability, much in the same way BuzzFeed has moved from cats into investigative journalism. But can it really escape the Unilad name and its legacy?
Kelley Temple, who was National Union of Students women’s officer between 2012 and 2014, doubts it’s possible to “detoxify” the brand while the culture it takes its name from is still going strong. “Only once lad culture and its sexist hypermasculinity is no longer condoned and prevalent in campus culture, do I think that branding associated with it will be less tarnished,” she says.
However, Harrington believes that “the way social works” means the name is no barrier. “If you go through your newsfeed, you go through Facebook, you don’t look at the name before you like something. You just like the content that is in front of you.”"

And there is no one to speak for me,” cries Effie in her moment of need. Appearances can deceive. For the previous hour Effie has been giving us the finger and giving us the gob, as the words pour out of her mouth – an open wound – like a torrent of vomit. Effie repeatedly calls herself a “stupid slag. Nasty skank.” She knows what we think about her by the way we can’t meet her gaze as she wanders the streets of Splott – in the south of Cardiff – a tiny fireball of sneering booze-filled aggression and self hatred disguised with a swagger.
Iphigenia in Splott: Gary Owen's protest letter to a hard-hearted state Read more
We’ve been here before in the theatre. Often. But in Gary Owen’s brawling, big-hearted, raging monologue Effie turns out to be different, gradually revealing her story via a dirty poetry and a blistering performance by Sophie Melville that has the fleetness of a Greek messenger delivering exceptionally bad news. On a night out, which seems doomed like so many others to end in chucking up at the Chicken Cottage and a three day hangover, Effie spots Lee. Describing the way she moves in on him “like a fucking cruise missile” Effie employs the language of war but when she reaches him she discovers that, like her, he’s already wounded: a victim of an IED in Afghanistan.
Effie thinks that their night together has changed everything and their meeting was fate. She no longer feels alone. She isn’t, but not in the way she thinks. One of the pleasures of Owen’s play is not just in the way it subtly changes our perception of Effie and gradually, almost lazily, builds to an explosive finish, but in its narrative drive. Owen tells a really good story and one involving cliffhangers which are brilliantly handled in Rachel O’Riordan’s tightly controlled production played out on Hayley Grindle’s design which conjures a world illuminated by bare strip lighting and sadness.
Iphigenia was Agamemnon’s daughter, sacrificed by her father to ensure a fair wind to Troy and to further the ambitions of men. But who are the Iphigenias of today, being sacrificed in the pursuit of growth and profit? Seeing the heart torn out of your community and services cut is like having your tongue put out. The ending is a little rushed, perhaps even a little too pat, but this is 75 minutes in which Effie finds a voice to remind that resilience is a sticking plaster, and what is required is revolution."
Classical music|Simon Rattle|Magdalena Kožená|Wigmore Hall|reviews,2016-01-31T13:08:05,guardian,Erica Jeal,Husband and wife showcase with a thrown-together feel sees Rattle and Kožená outperformed by their string quartet,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/31/simon-rattle-magdalena-kozena-and-friends-wigmore-hall-london-review-chamber-music-ensemble,Simon Rattle/Magdalena Kožená et al review - ensemble outshines the stars,en,culture|music,,"Simon Rattle’s debut appearance at London’s chamber-music HQ – as pianist, not conductor – was a kind of bring-your-husband-to-work day for mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kožená, who has her own series of concerts there this season. Presumably it was Rattle’s presence that so inflated the ticket prices; but the performance itself took a long while to come anywhere near justifying them.
Six other formidable musicians were onstage: a string quartet drawn mainly from Rattle’s Berlin Philharmonic, flautist Kaspar Zehnder, and Andrew Marriner, who will be Rattle’s principal clarinettist when he takes over the LSO. The first half was intriguingly programmed, mostly songs on a Shakespearian theme. Kožená wove gleaming, elastic threads around the muted strings and piano in Chausson’s Chanson Perpétuelle, but was less comfortable sparring with flute, viola and clarinet in Stravinsky’s three lean Songs from William Shakespeare.

Duetting with Rattle in Strauss’s Ophelia Songs, she was more confident; but still, her topmost notes stubbornly refused to bloom. It was good to hear Ravel’s sultry Madagascan Songs from 1926, the middle one a bold anti-colonial statement. But all these performances had a thrown-together feel, with Kožená reading off a music stand and only fitfully animating the words, Rattle melting into the background, and the others seizing their solos but not seeming part of a fully formed interpretation.
In the second half Brahms’s Two Songs with Viola, for which Kožená and Rattle were joined by Amihai Grosz, at last brought a buzz of energy to the platform. Kožená is reliably at her best in her native, Czech repertoire: Rikadla, Janáček’s succinct, strident nursery-rhyme settings, were vividly done, with Marriner and Rattle cheeky and incisive; and Kožená’s voice glowed in seven Dvorak songs, given in new arrangements involving the whole ensemble. And this was indeed an ensemble concert, not a star recital; of the final encore, Strauss’s Morgen, it’s Daishin Kashimoto’s violin solo that lingers in the memory more than Kožená’s singing or Rattle’s playing."
Newspapers|Peter Preston on press and broadcasting|The Observer|Newspapers & magazines|Guardian Media Group|Anthony Howard|David Astor|comment,2017-11-19T07:00:54,guardian,Peter Preston,The former Observer editor’s book tells how newspapers have an existence of their own – and sometimes their lives need saving,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/19/donald-trelford-book-children-history-observer,Reading Donald Trelford’s history of a public friend and companion,en,UK|media,,"Today’s print newspapers still, in one sense, wrap tomorrow’s cod and french fries. But there is a different way of remembering them. One of the things that prompted Donald Trelford, editor of this paper from 1975 to 1993, to write Shouting in the Street, his collation of reminiscences (Biteback, £25), was simply that. He had two very young children who, as he turned 80, would never really understand the life he had lived – unless he told them.
What will Ben and Poppy make of it all once they are fully grown? Perhaps that the great journalists who fill the book’s pages – David Astor, Michael Davie, Katharine Whitehorn, Anthony Sampson and many others – were more than names on a dusty page. Perhaps that there always was and always will be ambition and double-dealing in any human activity, including newsrooms: see Trelford’s feline dispatch of a conniving deputy, Anthony Howard.
But they will surely be struck most of all by their dad’s gallant efforts to sustain the Observer as, through his years in charge, he fought for its survival in a world of ever-changing ownerships. They won’t know Tiny Rowland from Lonrho, Sir Edward du Cann or Robert O Anderson of Atlantic Richfield: but they will know that editing so well for so long was victory snatched from the ever-snapping jaws of defeat.
They may also learn something profound about the business of journalism. Newspapers, first very rough drafts of history, may disappear with the fish and chips. But newspapers are living organisms, the constructs of time, vision and history that give them an existence. They live, too. They are stages where the curtain rises fresh each morning.
Trelford – often lonely, perpetually embattled – helped save the paper he loved. He sensed an instinctive duty to a historic friend and public companion. Will Ben and Poppy find that in the Facebooks and Googles of their lives when they’re grown?"
Newspapers|Peter Preston on press and broadcasting|Brexit|Newspapers & magazines|comment,2017-11-19T07:00:54,guardian,Peter Preston,"Brexit has drained Britain of its authority – and, it would seem, its competence.

Donald Trump doesn’t sit by his phone waiting for Theresa May to call. “We are no longer able to build a coalition in Brussels behind our foreign policy objectives. No one wants to be seen to be working with a member state about to depart” … “We have rendered ourselves irrelevant.”
Which is a condition for editors and broadcasters to take to heart, too. For years, from the pulpit of leader writing rooms and BBC studios, we’ve been advising the world how to behave. But see how that pulpit has fallen to bits.
Our foreign secretary can’t even get one imprisoned Brit’s backstory right, let alone get her out of Iran. Our long-serving defence secretary vanishes at the stroke of a knee. President Putin takes nil notice when the PM berates his sinister social media offensive. And, as those who read European newspapers may attest, our Brexit dilemmas are a source of polite bafflement.
The UK, when it’s mentioned at all, is treated as a fading friend suffering from some kind of awful, undiagnosed sickness. (Or, according to Rafael Behr in the Guardian, the continent sees “a country fast degenerating from trusted ally to nightmare neighbour”.)
All this has a clear impact. British news, day after day, means Brexit, Brexit, Brexit. We’re absorbed by our own irresolution. Overarching questions – the reform of the UN, a defined role for Nato, the global economy – are pushed to one side. We look inwards, rather than out at a troubled world.
It’s no help, of course, that the American press seems similarly stymied, doomed day after day to shoot at the open target called Trump, so that mockery and revulsion become the polar opposites of leadership. But don’t overlook the British problem. “Our politics is in turmoil,” says Powell, “the prime minister powerless, the minority government on the verge of extinction.”
Too bleak? Perhaps. For remember: optimism, vital optimism, doesn’t just keep nations going. It conditions what their chroniclers say.
The most powerful editorial I read last week was in Le Monde, following President Macron on a whirlwind tour of France’s industrial towns and sink estates. “For two days, the head of state has spared no effort to demonstrate that his reforming ambition would cover all the territories of the republic, including the most disadvantaged.”
And Kath Viner, editor-in-chief of the Guardian, gave a notable lecture: “If people long to create a better world, then we must use our platform to nurture imagination – hopeful ideas, fresh alternatives, belief that the way things are isn’t the way things need to be. We cannot merely criticise the status quo; we must also explore the new ideas that might displace it. We must build hope.”
Well, we’ll see. But energy and belief can walk hand in hand – not just for politicians but for the media that watches over them."

A few dozen gripes about a programme watched by millions can be relatively insignificant – especially in an era of mass tweeting and trolling. Edgy drama or comedy that is pushing the boundaries is bound to offend as well as entertain.
Why does Ofcom get involved in providing more easy headline fodder for the corporation’s foes? Transparency is the accustomed cry of an over-zealous regulator – but this, transparently, is just meddling for the sake of it.
Snooze? Or power nap?
Twenty-four hour news coverage is there to deal with a big story – say another terrorist bomb – when it happens. Maybe at 2am.

It isn’t obviously overmanning on the nation’s biggest news resource – more contingency planning for when all hell breaks loose."
Oil|Business leader|Commodities|Fossil fuel divestment|Oil and gas companies|Energy industry|Norway|comment,2017-11-19T07:00:54,guardian,,Experts are not predicting the end of drilling quite yet: but the decision in Oslo has sharpened the debate over the future profitability of the industry,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/19/norway-fund-sells-out-of-oil-fossil-fuels-starting-to-look-risky-norges-bank,"As Norway sells out of oil, suddenly fossil fuels are starting to look risky",en,business,,"Despite the rise of electric cars and stronger action on climate change, it’s still too early to write the obituary of oil. That was the verdict last week of one of the world’s leading energy experts, economist Dr Fatih Birol.
The International Energy Agency, which he leads, is expecting growth in appetite for oil to slow over the next two decades, but doesn’t see demand peaking this side of 2040 because the fuel will still be needed for trucks, ships, aviation and petrochemicals.
As the energy watchdog drily notes, such a scenario would mean a disastrous failure to rein in the worst impacts of global warming.
But there was a glimmer of hope last week from, ironically enough, one of the world’s biggest oil-producing countries. Unlike Britain, which squandered much of the wealth of its North Sea oil and gas boom, Norway has been sensible enough to squirrel away its hydrocarbon tax receipts – and now has a $1tn sovereign wealth fund to show for it.
Now, the Norwegian central bank, which manages the fund, is proposing that it ditch the investments in the very industry the fund was built on.
In a letter to Norway’s finance ministry, Norges Bank wrote: “We conclude that the vulnerability of government wealth to a permanent drop in oil and gas prices will be reduced if the fund is not invested in oil and gas stocks, and advise removing these stocks from the fund’s benchmark index.”
The recommendation rested “exclusively on financial arguments”, it added. Climate change and the environment did not even merit an aside – the advice is all about a fund manager maximising value for their client.
Oil prices have yo-yoed from below $30 a barrel in January to more than $60 now due to output curbs by the world’s biggest producers.
But some experts think that in the medium term it will be lower than in recent decades – Shell’s chief executive has warned of “lower forever” rather than BP’s “lower longer”. Dieter Helm, an influential energy economist, believes oil prices will carry on falling forever. That’s a risk that Norway’s central bank does not want to take.
The institution admits it may even be underestimating the risk from the fund’s £27.73bn oil and gas holdings, because oil firms’ current low operating costs – a response to the 2014-16 price slump – may not last.
“These [costs] may move differently to oil prices, which means that our analysis may underestimate the risk-mitigating effect of our recommendation on total oil risk in government wealth,” the bank noted.
It might be tempting to write off the significance of the move as parochial and relevant only to Norway, which is particularly exposed to oil price falls.
Indeed, some observers have belittled the wider impact of its ditching its oil and gas stocks. “Nothing is imminent and even if the advice is fully implemented we believe this will have limited impact on the oil and gas producers, as the holdings of Norges Bank are relatively small and no doubt will be disposed of over an extended timeframe,” said investment management firm Quilter Cheviot.
They’re right, to a degree. Norway’s holdings of $5bn in Shell and $2bn in BP are not huge given the scale of those companies, and the share prices of both firms have recovered some of their falls since Norges Bank’s proposal was published on Thursday.
But that is to miss the big picture. A $1tn fund has just decided that oil and gas is a sector that’s too risky to invest in. The decisions taken by Norway’s sovereign wealth fund will have ripples, and major investment funds will take their cues from it.
As activist group Share Action points out, institutional investors are already withdrawing capital from oil and gas firms whose business models look increasingly vulnerable. Norway’s fund isn’t the first to realise that, and it certainly won’t be the last.
Airbus A380 is bold and beautiful, but is it too much of a behemoth?
As auspicious places for Airbus to sell a few more of its A380 superjumbos go, this should have been a good one: on the home turf of its biggest buyer, which had signalled its intention to splash out.
Instead, the Dubai airshow appears to have left more clouds over the European superjumbo after Emirates, the only airline to have consistently championed the A380, decided to spend $15bn on 40 Dreamliners from rival Boeing. An anticipated order for 30 Airbus planes apparently foundered on the failure to offer guarantees that they would still be in production in 10 or 15 years’ time.
Airbus chief executive Tom Enders has publicly professed faith in the future of the world’s biggest jet aircraft, but neither its maker nor its main operator appears willing to bet the house on it. Airbus announced in 2015 that the A380’s development costs had finally been recouped, but only eight of the $437m planes will now be built each year. Whether, or by how much, the discounted price airlines pay exceeds production costs is a secret known only to the manufacturer’s accountants.
Airbus’s business hinges on far more than one model: in an order book that now surpasses a trillion dollars, the superjumbo plays an increasingly small part. The firm’s profits took a knock this year, but its share price is rising, and plenty of airlines are convinced by its single-aisle A320neo. Indeed, the triumph of Dubai for Airbus was a single order for 430 of the short-haul planes, its biggest ever deal for departing sales supremo John Leahy.
Yet even a record deal couldn’t deflect questions over the missing superjumbo order. Only in the Gulf has this giant found the sustained financial backing and strategy to keep it flying, while other airlines have cut their cloth to suit different planes and routes.
Emirates’s equivocation will test Airbus executives’ commitment. But it may have confirmed the demise of the A380: like all great dinosaurs, it’s monumental and awe-inspiring, but maybe just too big for this world.
Are wise men behind Greggs’s sausage roll nativity?
Plaudits to Greggs for generating a festive outrage last week that did not revolve around councils banning Christmas. The bakery chain made its pitch for the Daily Express front page by launching an advent calendar with a nativity scene where a sausage roll took the place of the infant Jesus. Cue an enormous social media backlash and the inevitable apology.
But without wishing to spread Scrooge-like cynicism, Greggs’ faux pas seems to have generated an awful lot of free publicity. Indeed, it is declining to pulp its calendar despite stating that it was “really sorry to have caused any offence” and “this was never our intention”. Yes. And core sausage roll ingredients might fly. After this outrage, it is highly unlikely that the tills at one of Britain’s most popular high street food chains will be having a bleak winterval.

Economics|William Keegan's In My View|Brexit|Budget 2017 (November)|Budget|Austerity|Economic policy|comment,2017-11-19T07:00:54,guardian,William Keegan,"Past generations of British politicians proved equal to the crises that faced them. This time, there is a strong whiff of panic in the corridors of power",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/19/brexit-lacks-credibility-remainers-lack-leadership-budget-2017,Brexit lacks credibility - but Remainers lack leadership,en,business|economics,,"To say that the lunatics have taken over the asylum would doubtless be termed politically incorrect. But the uncomfortable truth is that a bunch of ideological Brexit clowns have perpetrated a coup on the British government and the majority of the British people.
Seldom – or, to be more precise, never – in half a century of covering British economics have I encountered such a failure of leadership at a time of crisis. We came close to the abyss in 1976 but were saved by Jim Callaghan, the prime minister, and Denis Healey, the chancellor. On that occasion, after fraught talks, the two held the cabinet together and negotiated a loan from the International Monetary Fund which restored our credibility in the markets.
Callaghan and Healey were political giants. So were the dissidents such as Tony Crosland, Michael Foot and Tony Benn, whom they managed to win round. And their civil servants respected what their political masters were trying to do.
No such respect now, and not surprisingly. It is increasingly obvious that, in Brexit, the British public has been sold a pup. The negotiations with our EU counterparts and the debate in Westminster have reached satirical proportions for one simple reason: the government has embarked on Mission Impossible.
This, I think, is the principal explanation for the deepening nastiness in tone of the more vociferous Brexiters. It started with the execrable attack by the Daily Mail on the supreme court for concluding that parliament, not the executive, should have the ultimate say.
The irony that the Mail and their Brexit friends were campaigning for bringing back ultimate authority from European law to British lawyers whose judgment they objected to seems to have escaped them. Then they moved on to attack those of us who wish to call a halt to this Gadarene rush to the Brexit cliff as “saboteurs” or “traitors”. What a wonderful distortion of language it is to describe patriots as traitors! Then, last week, we had the Daily Telegraph, in former days renowned for the fairness of its news coverage, making the main news on its front page photographs of 15 Conservative MPs presented as a kind of rogues’ gallery, with the banner headline “The Brexit Mutineers”.
All this smacks of panic in the ranks of the Brexiters. And yet, if there is not exactly panic in the ranks of the Remain camp, the complaint I continually hear is that it still lacks a strong leader. Why, even George Osborne’s biographer, Janan Ganesh, was hinting in the Financial Times last week that it needs someone with the determination of Gordon Brown.
The recent publication of Brown’s fascinating memoirs reminds one, too, of his heroic exercise of leadership in 2008-09, in rescuing the world economy from the financial crisis. His memoirs contain a strong defence of the Keynesian measures he took and preached to others – an example of leadership that won the approbation of Presidents Obama and Sarkozy.
Unfortunately, the stimulus in this country was withdrawn prematurely by the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition, whose policies of austerity from 2010 onwards damaged not only the social fabric but also investment and the productivity on which it depends.
Indeed, as Remainer Philip Hammond has been drawing up the budget – due on Wednesday – the Office for Budget Responsibility has warned that the economy’s enfeebled productivity places a manifest constraint on his room for manoeuvre, as does the prospect of Brexit.
This does not, of course, deter the Brexiters: not at all. Both the ubiquitous Jacob Rees-Mogg and that long-time Eurosceptic John Redwood – one of John Major’s “bastards” – have told the Treasury to make its forecasts more optimistic, so that a cushion can be provided for the damage that will almost certainly occur if Brexit is not stopped. Redwood knows the score: in his capacity as an investment adviser he has been downplaying the prospects for Britain and advising clients to invest in, er, mainland Europe.
Redwood and Rees-Mogg seem blissfully unaware that, first, the Treasury no longer makes pre-budget forecasts, and, second, that it was precisely to discontinue the ancient practice of chancellors trying to fiddle the forecast that responsibility for it was put in the hands of the OBR.
Incidentally, I do not blame non-experts for being misled by Brexiters’ false claims in the referendum. The Cameron government should have explained how the whole of the UK benefits from the EU. We are essentially a region of Europe, and take for granted a daily supply system of goods, services and – especially – food that would be severely disrupted by “no deal” and the consequent huge bureaucratic problems at the ports.
Only last week the benefits of being part of a strong trading bloc were demonstrated when the European commission made it clear that it would be acting for the UK in the dispute between Boeing and Bombardier. Brussels has clout in trade disputes; on its own the UK would be crushed in negotiation by powerful US lobbies.
When we applied to join the EEC in the early 1970s, the negotiations were founded on common objectives: both sides wanted UK entry. On Brexit there are no common objectives; hence the shambles. All this stuff about “negotiating” a £20bn divorce settlement is so much hogwash. We are legally bound to pay some £60bn in the course of the rest of the decade anyway.
That is, whether or not we go ahead on this disastrous course. My impression is that people are gradually hearing the opposite message, not least the young. If the polls move markedly in favour of Remain, then whoever is prime minister should broadcast to the nation that it is time to think again."
Apprenticeships|The Observer|Manufacturing sector|Confederation of British Industry (CBI)|Brexit|Budget 2017 (November)|features,2017-11-19T12:46:13,guardian,Richard Partington,"Budget should include measures on training and skills shortages, with British firms set to lose easy access to migrant labour",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/18/apprenticeships-budget-hammond-skills-shortages-brexit,The Brexit clock is ticking - time for Hammond to boost apprenticeships,en,UK|education,,"Go to university and you get a head start on your peers. In a Britain of haves and have-nots, this remains a widespread perception. But Tom Ratcliffe disproves it. Unlike his history graduate friend, who is working in Sports Direct in their home city of Derby, the 23-year-old has had more luck as an apprentice to one of the world’s oldest clockmakers.
“I have friends coming out of university without a job. There just isn’t the work out there for them,” he says. Instead of graduating with a huge debt and no guarantee of work, Ratcliffe is among thousands of apprentices in Britain being paid to learn on the job.
In the Budget on Wednesday, Chancellor Philip Hammond will be expected to address the problem of skills shortages in Britain, as demands for more investment in schools and training escalate in an economy needing more workers like Ratcliffe. After years of underinvestment in workplace training, and faced with the prospect of firms losing access to migrant labour, the UK needs to bolster its domestic workforce. Companies are increasingly reporting shortages of key skills.
Ratcliffe is one of several apprentices at Smith of Derby. Established in 1856, the firm is responsible for famous timepieces the world over, from the tower clock at St Paul’s cathedral to ones on the customs house in Shanghai and Arsenal’s emirates stadium.
With just 57 staff and revenue of about £3m a year, it’s a small company. But it’s a big name in the world of horology, maintaining about 4,500 clocks around Britain. About 20 staff were dispatched to put clocks on public buildings back by an hour when British summer time ended last month.
Despite a government push on apprenticeships, few employers have responded. The number of apprentices starting in May, June and July was down by 61% compared with the same time last year, raising doubts over the government’s pledge of 3 million new apprentices by 2020.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Apprentice Sam Schoonderwoerd says he much prefers learning on the job – and getting paid
Smith of Derby has taken on apprentices for the first time in several years. The firm was founded by an apprentice, John Smith, whose descendants still own the company. “At the moment, we have a succession issue, so we have to bring new blood in,” says managing director Bob Betts.
More apprentices will soon be needed, as decades of access to flexible, skilled migrant labour looks set to be curtailed by Brexit. Some economists believe the availability of trained migrant labour has made firms complacent. Figures from the European Commission’s statistics body, Eurostat, show that British companies invest half as much per worker in vocational training as the EU average, and that investment in skills has fallen by 9% in real terms over the past decade.
Yael Selfin of accountant KPMG says: “Companies will need to invest more in their staff, because labour isn’t going to be as easily available. You need to start with schools, giving youngsters more opportunities, as well as more apprenticeships.” Accountant Deloitte estimates that a third of non-British workers in the UK are thinking of leaving within five years – equal to 1.2 million jobs.
Developments in technology are also putting a greater emphasis on skills, with 15 million jobs thought to be at risk from automation. And with the productivity of UK employees stubbornly refusing to rise, additional spending on training could boost efficiency levels.
Smith’s apprentices learn to work with industrial revolution-era kit, which may seem a strange fit for millenials comfortable with smartphones and social media, but they also get the chance to travel. The company has growing sales in the Middle East, and projects in Asia and North America.
“I enjoy working hands-on with old stuff,” says Sam Schoonderwoerd, another of the apprentices. “It was never something I considered when I was younger, but it’s fallen into place.” The 20-year-old from Derby is in his second year at the firm and spends a day a week at college studying for a higher national certificate – equivalent to the first year of a university degree.
With tuition fees at over £9,000 a year, many young people are put off higher education at a time when the cost of living is rising. Hammond’s budget will be expected to cater for this generation, as the Conservatives look to reverse a flight by younger voters to Labour.
More help with apprentices could be a remedy, if technical training is seen as a path to a good job, without high levels of debt. Mitchell Eaton, 20, another apprentice at Smith of Derby, says he found it hard to concentrate at school and prefers to learn on the job: “Rather than doing university, I’m learning and getting paid at the same time – which is a bonus.”.
But if Hammond wants more apprentices like these, he will need to show businesses that the government is ready to support their hiring plans.
The Confederation of British Industry has made protecting per-pupil funding in schools a key priority in its submission to the chancellor ahead of the budget. Skills, training and the country’s industrial strategy will also be key themes for the group. Director general Carolyn Fairbairn says investing in education and training is the “best economic growth strategy we have”.

Budget 2017 (November)|The Observer|Philip Hammond|Brexit|Public sector pay|Public sector cuts|Austerity|features,2017-11-18T16:00:36,guardian,Phillip Inman,"Does the chancellor upset some by loosening the purse strings, or imperil a government with no majority by wielding the axe?",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/18/chancellor-hammond-budget-big-five,"Hammond’s budget big five: cuts, pay, housing, roads and students",en,UK,,"Does the chancellor upset some by loosening the purse strings, or imperil a government with no majority by wielding the axe? Whatever he decides, some topics will have to be addressed
Philip Hammond will face his toughest test as chancellor on Wednesday when he stands up to deliver his third and most important budget statement. By comparison, the 2016 autumn statement and this year’s spring budget were exercises in treading water. Conservative MPs expect him to set the agenda for the rest of the government’s term and deliver a vision of how Britain will prosper outside the European Union.
The task is daunting. Without an overall majority, and with factions inside the party calling for his head, Hammond is in a bind. Loosening the purse strings will upset Tories who want to eliminate the deficit some time in the next 10 years; keeping austerity in place risks further cuts to politically sensitive public services such as the NHS, schools and the police.
Q&A Why is the November 2017 budget so tricky for Philip Hammond? Show Hide Philip Hammond’s November 2017 budget will reflect the tricky choices facing the chancellor as he seeks to balance the forces pulling him in opposite directions. Downgrades to the UK’s long-term growth potential by the Office for Budget Responsibility will complicate Hammond’s budget arithmetic, as will uncertainty over the impact of Brexit on the economy. Both would normally result in an ultra-cautious approach. But the loss of the government’s overall majority in the June general election has ramped up the pressure on the chancellor to spend money in areas where the Conservatives feel vulnerable: housing, the NHS, education and infrastructure. Hammond is short of cash, so the budget will be a mixture of tax-raising measures and giveaways. Photograph: Mark Thomas/REX/Shutterstock/Rex Features
Hammond wants to sidestep this debate and focus on measures to improve productivity, boost the housing market, help consumers and support high-growth firms. Here we examine five areas he must tackle to show that the government has, at the very least, an economic strategy – even though questions will remain over the existence of funds to implement it.
Austerity

Hammond is under pressure to alleviate the pain spending cuts have inflicted on public services and the welfare system over the past seven years. His aim is to reduce government borrowing to below 2% of GDP by 2020-21 and to eliminate the deficit – the gap between state income and expenditure – by 2025. These deadlines are sufficiently far away to give him room for manoeuvre on Wednesday.
Last week, a group representing 5,000 headteachers visited Downing Street to tell Hammond that the new national funding formula for schools in England, introduced by education secretary Justine Greening in September, had done little to alleviate “the funding crisis ... engulfing schools across the country”. While the new system included a £1.3bn investment, the National Audit Office had already announced that schools would face real-term cuts of £3bn by 2020, so they would still be £1.7bn worse off.
The budget for schools, like that for hospitals, was deemed “protected” during the coalition government. This was after David Cameron pledged in 2010 to increase funding for those departments at least in line with inflation, while other parts of Whitehall took real terms cuts of up to 40%. Both departments had, however, fared better under Labour. Schools had improved their results over the previous decade on the back of inflation-busting increases. Likewise the NHS had enjoyed budget increases of 4% in real terms on average since the turn of the century, compared with 1% after 2010.
The funding support of the Blair and Brown era has gone. Schools face real-term cuts between now and 2021, while the NHS is still on its growth path of 1%. Meanwhile rising demand in both creates a sense that departments are going backwards, and stokes public anger. Labour has pledged to increase funding for schools, restore police numbers and boost NHS and local government budgets, paid for by tax rises and a bigger clampdown on tax avoidance.
Hammond’s tax rises will probably mimic the “stealth taxes” favoured by Gordon Brown. In his spring budget, Hammond increased insurance premium tax, as a painless surcharge on the industry. Insurers have warned against a repeat, as have whisky makers after an increase in duty in spring.
Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, says Hammond could freeze income-tax thresholds after they reach the levels pledged in the Tory manifesto in 2021/22 – a tax-free allowance of £12,000 and a 40p rate threshold of £50,000. A freeze after 2021/22 would free up £8.6bn, which he could choose to bank now and promise as extra spending for schools and hospitals.
Public sector pay
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hospitals say the pay cap is making it almost impossible to fill ward vacancies. e Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA
Back in the summer, a report showed that teachers were £3 an hour worse off in real terms and police officers by £2 an hour over the past decade, while the wages of nurses had stagnated. A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found average public sector earnings had fallen by 4% in real terms since 2009-10, and said continuing pay restraint would take wages to “historically low levels” compared with the private sector. With a 1% pay cap in place, schools and hospitals across the UK are finding it difficult to fill teaching and nursing posts.
However, increasing public sector pay across the board in line with either prices or private sector earnings would be expensive, adding £6bn a year by 2019-20 to the cost of employing 5.1 million public sector workers .
Hammond’s message is expected to be sympathetic, as much to address the gender pay gap across the public sector as the average pay in Whitehall, local government and frontline services. He has already given the police and prison officers a 1% rise plus a 1% bonus for 2017-18, but there will be little extra in the kitty with teachers already set to remain on 1%.
Housing
Facebook Twitter Pinterest The housing minister says 300,000 new homes a year are needed. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA
Borrow to build is Sajid Javid’s favourite slogan. The secretary of state responsible for housing says up to 300,000 additional homes must be built in England each year, up from around 150,000 in 2015 and a little more than 220,000 over the past year.
Last month Javid said the aim was for “a big increase in all types of home”, including social housing, so-called build-to-rent properties and shared equity homes – where a buyers’ mortgage only covers part of the market value of the property.
“We are looking at new investments, and there will be announcements – I am sure the budget will be covering housing,” he said.
The Bank of England’s help to buy scheme is infamous for lining the pockets of developers rather than spurring house building, so the chancellor will be looking at fresh ideas. One is for local authorities to be able to borrow funds and to be given greater freedom to develop local housing schemes.
Last year Hammond promised £7.2bn to support the construction of new homes. The Local Government Association says planners are giving the go-ahead to 90% of applications made, but with plenty of Nimbys lobbying against new schemes, only greater powers for local politicians will break the logjam and allow the money to be spent.
Transport and investment
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Budgets always include road widening schemes. Photograph: Alamy
One section of every post-2010 budget speech is always dedicated to a list of road widening schemes, dual carriageway extensions and motorway repairs. Sometimes the introduction of a potholes hotline adds some levity to the chancellor’s list of planned capital projects. The same is expected this time, though MPs will be disappointed if they hear nothing about faster rail links between northern cities as part of efforts to increase productivity.
Hammond said last year: “If the UK raised its productivity by one percentage point every year, within a decade it would add £240bn to the size of the economy – £9,000 for every household in Britain.”
He has already handed out most of his investment funds to the transport department, which probably couldn’t handle any more cash without throwing it wastefully at consultants. The capacity of the railway system for change is also pushing at the margins of what is possible, especially now that private contractors including Carillion, which is working on the HS2 line from London to Birmingham, are in financial trouble.
A £23bn national productivity investment fund was launched last December with £2.6bn to improve transport networks. Digital networks are also on Hammond’s radar, and he will look to shift the debate from trains to broadband, especially for enhancing the connectivity of the northern powerhouse.
Students and young people
Facebook Twitter Pinterest A student march in London this month: a review of fees and loans is under way. Photograph: Marcin Wziontek/Rex
Pressure to match Labour’s pledge to cut university fees to zero has eased. The pledge, worth between £8bn and £12bn a year to students, might have won Labour a large rise in under-25 votes, but Tories are well aware that without matching Labour’s tax rises, it will send the deficit soaring.
Theresa May has already made an expensive commitment to raise the threshold at which students begin repaying their loan, from £21,000 to £25,000. She told the Tory conference that tuition fees would also be frozen at the current £9,250 until 2019, rather than increased with inflation by £250.
A review of student finance is under way, with ideas to reform the fees structure, possibly aligning fees more closely to the salaries graduates of a certain course can later command.
But Hammond is expected to say that his plan to increase housing stock is the best way to help young people, possibly allied to an income tax “age-allowance” for under-30s. The allowance could taper away as income rises.
David Kilshaw of accountant EY, said an alternative would be to reduce national insurance for under-30s: “One key theme is intergenerational fairness. Typically chancellors use tax breaks to help the elderly, but this time the break may tilt towards the next generation.”

Wrestling with Stelios has tended to be part of the job description when running the budget carrier, but that perk now comes on top of a mounting list of fiddly tasks. We will find out more about them at the company’s final results this week, when current chief exec Carolyn McCall sets the doors to manual before her disembarkation.
McCall will hand the controls to Lundgren just as the UK aviation industry is peering through the fog to work out what its future relationship with the EU will look like following Brexit. Analysts at Investec say that, given the significance of the UK to the European aviation market, they reckon a special case will be made, but add a note of caution that easyJet is the firm most at risk if something goes wrong.
Lundgren also needs to oversee the integration of parts of the recently acquired Air Berlin business, plus there’s the hunt to buy bits of Italy’s insolvent airline Alitalia, and collapsed rival Monarch Airlines. Meanwhile, there are concerns about the current state of the budget airline sector, on the back of a weaker pound and recent terrorist attacks. Developing.
Hill set to kick up about kicking the FOBT habit
Fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) are said to be the “crack cocaine of gambling” and some problem gamblers certainly find the machines extremely addictive.
But the gambling industry itself also finds FOBTs pretty moreish: companies have become hooked on the profits these machines have generated, and are effectively arguing that the industry as we know it could not survive without them.
Late last month it was announced that the maximum stake that can be gambled on FOBTs would be cut, after the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport admitted that existing limits, which allow gamblers to bet up to £300 a minute, were, er, inappropriate.
The maximum bet will be cut from £100 to between £2 and £50, and you’ll be astonished to learn that the bookies, who warn that shops will close if maximum stakes are cut, will lobby for the £50 option during a 12-week consultation period ending in January.
All of which brings us to the results of bookmaker William Hill this week – in its first outing since the announcement. Expect grumbling about its fix being taken away.
Cruddas recouped CMC losses. Punters may not
Entanglements with financial spread-betting firms have always proved more lucrative for the companies’ founders than their clients.
IG Group made Stuart Wheeler so rich that he could afford to spend millions restoring crumbling old relics (Kent’s Chilham Castle in 2002 and the Conservative party in 2001, the old gag goes), while even industry minnow London Capital Group made Simon Denham rich enough to buy the former home of a former music star (Liam Howlett of the Prodigy).
Peter Cruddas, the founder of CMC Markets, is the richest of them all, having supposedly once been a billionaire (although he’s scraping by on much less these days). His vast wealth took a bit of a hit after the company floated, with the shares now 30% cheaper than when they listed on the stock exchange in February 2016.
Even so, the firm has had a decent run during 2017, which means Cruddas has made back some of his losses. That recent upwards trajectory of the stock suggests investors are expecting cheery news when CMC unveils interim results this week – although it is probably sage not to bet on that.
What Cruddas and his ilk often forget to mention is this: only about 20% of spread-betting punters actually make money.

"Italy|The Observer|Silvio Berlusconi|Italian food and drink|Europe|Migration|Italy
(Football)|features",2017-11-19T00:05:46,guardian,Tobias Jones,"Dumped out of the World Cup, mired in political controversy, the country’s pride has been wounded. Time to take refuge in some traditional delights …",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/19/italy-self-esteem-takes-a-beating-world-cup-political-controversy,"Italy’s self-esteem has taken a beating, but I still wouldn’t live anywhere else",en,world|europe,,"Millions of Italians have been understandably despondent for the past few days. The results of the regional elections in Sicily proved that former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is back in the big time. With a face that looks more sinister with each passing year, the 81-year-old politician took the credit for a victory in which his rightwing coalition won more than double the votes of the left.
Then, on Monday evening, the Italian football team were dumped out of the World Cup in the qualifying stages, beaten in the playoffs by the humble but hard-working Swedes. For the first time since 1958, the Azzurri – four-time winners – won’t even be at the tournament. “It feels like not being invited to your own birthday party,” said a glum Italian friend.
Football was one of the remaining reasons Italians felt any national pride. With that gone, it seems that their self-esteem has hit rock-bottom. All’italiana has become short-hand for something done badly, with corners cut and, probably, a bit of corruption too. It’s a country, says everyone, allo sfascio – ruined or collapsed. Last month Andrea Camilleri, author of the Inspector Montalbano books, derided that well-worn phrase of national self-approval Italiani, brava gente (Italians – good people): “We Italians are racist,” he said, “why don’t we want to say it? Forget ‘good people’.”
No one would pretend that the country isn’t in a grave crisis: youth unemployment stands at 37.8%, some 11.9% of Italians are living in “extreme poverty”. The national public debt is at 134.7% of GDP (according to EU treaties, it’s supposed to be at 60%). Corruption is endemic and every year the various mafias seem to spread like black ink on blotting paper.
Perhaps most worryingly, more people are looking back nostalgically not to Berlusconi, but to the man who sometimes inspires him: Benito Mussolini. Italy’s far right is now vocally and visually present in every football stadium, with straight-arm salutes so normal they’re not even news. Last month, stickers of Anne Frank were put up in Rome’s Stadio Olimpico, a sign that to many fans the Holocaust is just a joke with which to taunt the opposition. In Ostia, neo-fascists recently won 9% of the vote.
And yet the reason the neo-fascists are winning votes is, paradoxically, the same reason Italians might stop their collective hand-wringing and feel proud of their country: Italy has offered refuge to more than three-and-a-half million immigrants in the last 15 years. In the space of barely two decades, Italy has gone from being an almost monocultural country to one with 10% of its population considered “foreign”. Last year more than 180,000 migrants arrived by ship alone.

Of course there are instances of racism, even murder, and it’s well-known that the mafias make money out of the mass migrations. The mooted jus soli legislation, granting citizenship to children of immigrants, is still a long way off (it was that which prompted Camilleri’s outburst).
But what Italy, and Greece, have done on the frontiers of Europe, while crippled by debt themselves and largely unsupported by the EU (only little Slovenia contributed to Italy’s noble Mare Nostrum sea rescues) is astonishing. Isolated incidents of intolerance and hatred make the news, but on the ground what you constantly see is Italians’ long tradition of hospitality: brusque, maybe, but unhindered by nationalism. There are many, tiny examples of it: the Calò family in Treviso who opened their home to six immigrants, or Francesco Tuccio, the Lampedusa carpenter so moved by the drowning of migrants that he started making tiny crucifixes from the wreckage of the boats, little relics to remind the world of others’ suffering.
It’s the same on the sporting front. Every year the country has a rival and grassroots alternative to the Fifa circus, called the “antiracist World Cup”. It’s so much more fun, and admirable, than the real thing. There’s an association called Matti per il Calcio, basically “mad for football”, involving psychiatric patients in great, inclusive games. For all its reputation for gamesmanship and whingeing, Italian sport has frequently been a means of enriching, even saving, lives: think of Gino Bartali, the great cyclist of the 1940s and 50s who, during the war, worked with the Jewish resistance, carrying clandestine documents in the tubes of his bicycle.
Bartali is a reminder of Giuseppe Garibaldi’s line that Italy would “never be short of people who can astound the world”. Life is almost unthinkable without Italian inventions: the barometer, the helicopter, the pianoforte, the radio, the typewriter, batteries, the microchip, the dynamo, pneumatic tyres and the nuclear reactor. That creativity is still in evidence today. Most Italian TV is as shockingly mind-melting as it ever was, but its cinema is enjoying a golden age, with directors such as Matteo Garrone and Paolo Sorrentino producing innovative and challenging works. Italian literature, too, has rarely enjoyed so much international esteem, not just thanks to Elena Ferrante and Camilleri, but also due to some sensationally good giallisti (thriller writers): Giancarlo de Cataldo, Gianrico Carofiglio, Massimo Carlotto and Giorgio Vasta.
Another constant gripe Italians have against their fellow countrymen is that they’re often imbroglioni, or conmen. It’s true, of course, that two of the world’s most famous swindlers are Italian: Carlo Ponzi (he of the pyramid selling scheme) and Giuseppe Balsamo, the self-proclaimed Count of Cagliostro, a Sicilian smooth-talker who, in a tiny way, helped cause the French Revolution. And yet, it’s very often Italians who have been victims.
Mussolini came to power in the aftermath of the first world war largely as a result of the sense of grievance that what the allies had promised the country had not been delivered by the treaty of Versailles. Plenty of Italians can lay claim to inventions for which they haven’t been credited: Garibaldi’s friend, Antonio Meucci, invented the telephone (or, as he called it, the telettrofono) but couldn’t afford the $10 to renew his patent and the glory went to others. To go back to the sore subject of Sweden and football: many Italians remember the suspicious 2-2 draw between Sweden and Denmark in the 2004 European Championships – exactly the result needed for both to go through and eliminate Italy. So much for upright northerners and dodgy Eyeties.
It’s one of the pleasures of living here that pompous patriotism is replaced by an attachment to your local town
But perhaps the reason it’s most difficult for Italians to be proud of being Italian is that they never, bar the football, think in nationalistic terms. It’s one of the pleasures of living here that pompous patriotism is replaced by an attachment to your local village, town or city. It’s what’s called, of course, campanilismo, attachment to the “belltower”. Even in tiny villages you regularly see graffiti proclaiming that this little settlement is caput mundi, the centre of the world, or that the next door one is merda. It often makes cosmopolitan Italians wince at the provincialism. And many understandably complain, as Dante did, that the country is ever divided against itself: think Guelph and Ghibelline, or the warring contrade (districts) in the Siena Palio horse race.
But there are charming and exquisite consequences of that rootedness. Italy has more grape varieties than the rest of the world put together. It has more surnames than China. In an ever more homogenised world, Italy has fiercely fought to maintain particularity and tiny traditions. No village is without its summer sagra, a celebration of local cuisine. Deriding Italy is a national pastime, but woe betide the heretic who insults the local town. The result is that if you travel just a dozen kilometres you come across new dialects, enticing wines, curious customs and, of course, fine food.
And it’s food, more now than football, that is the last refuge of that dying breed, the Italian patriot. For many, the act of eating is an almost sacred rite. Bread is something numinous: the highest compliment you can pay to someone is that they’re buono come il pane (as good as bread) and Italians are shocked less by English food than the fact that we eat it without bread. “It’s like,” says my same, glum friend, “not having half the cutlery.” In Italy, the table is a place outside time (hence the country’s “slow food” movement) in which capitalist greed is held at bay (you never tip in a restaurant, in fact they “tip” you, invariably putting bottles of liqueur on the table for free).
Come the spring, the country will almost certainly elect an alarming far-right government, and come the summer the World Cup will feel like someone else’s party. And yet most Italians will still begrudgingly feel, like Giuseppe Verdi, that “you may have the universe if I may have Italy”.

Evolution|The Observer|Archaeology|Genetics|Neanderthals|Anthropology|Biology|features,2017-11-19T00:05:46,guardian,Robin Mckie,Giant leaps in our understanding of the human journey are now being made by sifting earth samples for the DNA of our ancestors,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/19/human-evolution-dna-revolution-mapping-genome,How a DNA revolution has decoded the origins of our humanity,en,science,,"Mapping the genomes of our ancestors has allowed scientists to uncover secrets and discover new mysteries in our evolution
Scientists made a remarkable discovery at Trou Al’Wesse in Belgium earlier this year. Inside a cave that overlooks the Hoyoux river they found clear evidence it had been occupied by Neanderthals tens of thousands of years ago. Yet the cave contained no skull fragments, no teeth – nor any other skeletal remains of this extinct species of human being.
The team, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, were sure of their ground, however. Their genetic analysis of soil samples, scraped from the cave floor, had pinpointed the presence of Neanderthals through that most definitive of biological markers: their DNA.
In other words, without digging up a bone or a molar, the team, led by geneticist Matthias Meyer, had found – merely by studying a few microscopic strands of DNA – that tens of thousands of years ago Neanderthals had sheltered at Trou Al’Wesse. It was the scientific equivalent of “extracting gold dust from the air”, as one researcher put it.
Such hyperbole is understandable. The Trou Al’Wesse sediments would have been packed with DNA from plants, bacteria and other cave animals that had accumulated over millennia – as well as possible contaminating genetic material from the scientists themselves. Yet the Leipzig group, whose work was reported in Science in April, was able to pinpoint the few invisible scraps of Neanderthal DNA that had lingered there and enrich this material until they had enough to study its makeup in detail, a feat they later repeated at several other caves in Europe and Asia.
“We don’t know what was the exact source of this Neanderthal DNA,” Meyer told the Observer. “It could have come from Neanderthals who bled, or sweated, or left urine or faeces in the cave. However, once these cells had broken open, their DNA would have spilled out and would have become bound to minerals in the soil, where they were preserved.”
This is the genetic equivalent of uncovering the great library of Alexandria Johannes Krausse, scientist
Meyer’s project is an example of the astonishing advances that have been made in studying ancient genomes. Apart from detecting the presence of Neanderthals and other ancient people at sites devoid of any other remains, researchers are also using these techniques to uncover ancient population movements, pinpoint previously unknown human species, track the evolution of human illnesses and uncover the sources of human creativity. A new window has been opened on to our past.
“This is the genetic equivalent of uncovering the great library of Alexandria. All we have to do now is to learn how to read what we have found,” said Johannes Krausse, of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Tubingen.
The study of ancient genomes began 20 years ago when scientists first developed techniques for extracting DNA from fossils and for creating sufficient copies of that genetic material to allow them to study and characterise them. This week leaders in the field will gather at the Wellcome genome campus in Cambridgeshire to mark the anniversary and discuss key recent developments. These will include work by researchers who have followed up the discovery that Neanderthals, who evolved separately from modern humans for more than half a million years, later interbred with us on several occasions as we emerged from our African homeland.
Other researchers will outline recent studies of the Denisovans, a mysterious people whose existence was revealed only when scientists extracted DNA from a tooth and a few bone fragments from the Denisova cave in Siberia and found it belonged to a previously unknown species of ancient human. Only a finger bone and three teeth of these people have ever been found, yet we know from genetic studies that Denisovans also interbred with modern humans. Their descendants, carrying small amounts of Denisovan DNA, then went on to settle in Melanesia and Australia thousands of years ago.
“Essentially, we are finding – thanks to DNA studies – that our relatively simple picture of human evolution was insufficiently detailed,” said Professor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, London. “It is now clear there was a lot more interbreeding between ancient species, including early Homo sapiens and others, and that there was a lot more movement of populations both in the distant past – and relatively recently.”
Q&A What is DNA? Seven key facts Show Hide Our genes are made of deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, which forms double helix strands inside the nuclei of our bodies’ cells.
DNA contains information that is passed from generation to generation and directs the development of our bodies. Scientists began studying ancient DNA 20 years ago when Svante Pääbo used gene amplification techniques to extract and analyse genetic material from Neanderthals. At first only fragments of Neanderthal DNA could be studied, but by developing techniques to piece together small overlapping fragments, it was possible to recreate the entire set of genes, or genome, of a Neanderthal. Subsequent research showed that most people outside Africa contain small numbers of Neanderthal genes, the result of interbreeding between the two species as modern humans emerged from their African homeland about 70,000 years ago. In 2010 scientists discovered the genome of a completely new human species in bone and tooth fragments found in the Denisova cave, Siberia. These people are now known as Denisovans. Research published last year suggests that modern humans interbred with both Neanderthals and Denisovans on numerous occasions over the past 250,000 years.
One intriguing discovery is provided by the identification of the Ust’-Ishim man, a 45,000-year-old male whose remains were found in Siberia. DNA taken from his thigh bone indicates he was a member of Homo sapiens who possessed a distinctive genetic lineage that has since disappeared entirely from the human gene pool.
And a similar fate seems to have affected the Oase people of Romania. Named after a specimen found at Peştera cu Oase, Romania, this population of Homo sapiens contained fairly high amounts of Neanderthal DNA from recent interbreeding but also died out without leaving any further trace in the biological record.
In contrast to these lost lineages, scientists have also uncovered evidence that about 15,000 years ago, as the first farmers were developing in the Middle East, a group of people known as basal Eurasians added their DNA to the gene pool of these early agriculturists. Yet no one knows who these people were. The ghostly imprint of their genes in modern human DNA is the only evidence we have so far of their existence.
A major player in uncovering this picture of mysterious, shifting populations is the Swedish researcher Svante Pääbo, who led much of the effort to sequence the Neanderthal genome and the discovery of the Denisovans. Like most others in the field, he too has been startled by the rate of progress.
“I now think it is possible that we could sequence the genes of people and animals that lived up to 1 million years ago,” he said. “Already we have isolated genes from a horse that was 700,000 years old – though it helped that it was preserved in permafrost. However, if you had asked me 20 years ago what the limit would be I would have said we would be lucky to go back 100,000 years.”

The insights gained through the study of ancient genomes go far beyond the study of our past. “There is a great deal we can learn about modern humans from this work,” said Tony Capra of Vanderbilt University in Nashville. “For example, we know that around 2% of the genomes of modern humans is made up of Neanderthal DNA. However, some parts of our genomes are noticeable because they never contain Neanderthal DNA. That indicates these sections contain genes that are crucial to our success as a species. Individuals who inherited Neanderthal versions of these sections of genomes simply died out. That has given us a key focus to study these parts (of the genome) very closely – which is what we are doing – to discover how they brought us to global dominance.”
All of which suggests the study of genes is going to be of growing importance in understanding our species and that research on ancient bones will become a sideline of little interest. Why dig for years to find skeleton fragments when you can simply sift soil samples to reveal the presence of ancient DNA? It is a point stressed by one of the Wellcome conference’s organisers, Dr Chris Tyler-Smith of the Sanger institute. “I would advise any young scientist interested in this to give up the struggle to find bones of ancient humans and instead study ways to extract DNA from soil,” he said. “You will get a lot more science done.”
Not surprisingly, many other scientists disagree. “We wouldn’t have the Neanderthal genome today if palaeontologists hadn’t uncovered their skeletons and revealed the fossilised bones which contain their DNA,” said Pääbo. Stringer also disagrees. “Ancient genome studies are a magnificent addition to the tools we use to study our past. But we still need the physical evidence to tell us what they looked like. How they lived. Whether they buried their dead or painted caves. And there are many human and human-like species for which we don’t have DNA. We need to get the whole picture.”"
Grayson Perry|The Observer|Brexit|Sheffield|features,2017-11-19T00:04:46,guardian,Vanessa Thorpe,Bridging divides was the theme as the popular visual artist delivered the first of a new Orwell lecture series in Sheffield,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/19/grayson-perry-orwell-lecture-sheffield,Grayson Perry goes north to help make Britain whole again,en,culture|art & design,,"A mysterious and extravagantly coutured figure boarded the Sheffield-bound East Midlands Trains service at St Pancras station on Wednesday morning. Wearing a Victorian-style cape over a lavender satin minidress with a pleated collar, the visual artist Grayson Perry was leaving the capital to meet some more of his increasingly enthusiastic public audience.
Around him in the carriage were a mix of travellers from a handful of British social tribes that Perry so ably identifies, both in his art and in his television documentaries. The only thing they appeared to have in common was that they were not looking at him. It seems the pantomime eye makeup and the outlandish garb can serve as a protective forcefield. Although Perry’s dressing-up habit might seem attention-seeking, it also effectively fends off the duller outside world without any hint of aggression. (Typically, Perry was quick to joke about his incongruous appearance for the journey up north, tweeting his 100,000 followers a selfie of his “grande dame” get-up underneath the words: “Wearing this outfit boarding the train to Sheffield I can kid myself it’s the Orient Express.”)
Perry, 57, was heading for Sheffield University, where he was to give the first annual Orwell Lecture in the North that evening on the subject of social empathy. He would be facing a crowd of almost a thousand, carefully targeted from around the city, as well as from the university. Tickets had sold quickly. Perry is a reliable entertainer, and that is not something you can say about many artists. Or many lecturers for that matter.

The city was a good choice, post-Brexit. The split of the vote between Leave and Remain in Sheffield mirrored the national result. While financial hardship may explain much of the discontent behind the feelings of the anti-European contingent, many others have been left reeling by the prospect of losing the regular influx of enthusiastic foreign students.
So the pressure was on Perry the potter to offer some kind of national panacea. Since the success of his 2013 BBC Reith lectures, the country increasingly looks to him not just to analyse its mindset amusingly, but to offer a way forward.
The book version of his Reith lectures, Playing to the Gallery, set out Perry’s culture credo more clearly than the talks had themselves. It is, according to the Observer’s review, a new kind of artistic manifesto. Instead of offering guidelines for improved taste, it is rather “a polemic for inclusivity”.
Perry’s has been a remarkable rise from the murky lowland habitat of a marginal artist to the rarified atmosphere enjoyed by those few national personalities who are licensed to explain the world to the rest of us on television. Born in Essex, he suffered a miserable childhood in Chelmsford. (He says that when he and his siblings meet up they still refer to each other as “shrapnel”). That evening, on stage in Sheffield, he was to shake up younger members of his audience by revealing that there is only one existing photograph of his teenage self and that it was taken by a neighbour. “Dysfunctional families don’t really want to advertise,” he explained poignantly.
After graduating in fine art from Portsmouth Polytechnic, Perry worked away in the niche avant-garde pottery scene, but came to wider notice when he won the Turner prize in 2003. After that his flamboyant feminine alter ego, Claire, ensured he was regularly pictured in magazines and newspapers, often attending a swish party or a gala opening. As the artist is fond of noting: “I am part of the establishment now.”
His recent clever tapestries chart our national mores, but also touch with precision on the human emotional landscape and have garnered considerable praise. One of them, the eight-metre wide Comfort Blanket, now graces the Graves gallery in Sheffield. But even people who don’t like his art do now tend to admit he is a gifted communicator. His 2012 television series on taste for Channel 4 was followed by further acclaimed programmes on identity and on masculinity and were seen as landmark viewing in our changing times. The political divisions surrounding the Brexit vote were handled for Channel 4 in May in Divided Britain, a show widely hailed as a triumph. “By the end Perry … had defined the new divides in British society more succinctly and graphically than anything I’ve seen or read from any sociologist, economist, political scientist or, indeed, journalist. As a contribution to understanding what on earth is going on in Britain these days, it’s not been bettered,” wrote Sean O’Grady in the Independent.

For Wednesday evening Perry had picked out the ironic title “I’ve read all the academic texts on empathy” to point up his academic insecurities. “I have read the spines of many books,” he quipped later. Yet his lecture swooped usefully on nuggets from the work of the controversial psychiatrist RD Laing and the social anthropologist Kate Fox, as well as from the long history of visual art. He also used a popular term culled from the Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci to account for his place on the lecturer’s platform. “I am an organic intellectual,” he said, wryly looking out at a hall containing more than its fair share of conventional professors.
The thrust of Perry’s message was this: people don’t like being told what to think, so if you want to influence them, you should talk to them as equals. He began provocatively by flashing a huge “trigger warning” sign. “You like trigger warnings now at universities, don’t you?” he said. There would be, he added, content that might offend someone. As his long legs gleamed above his huge, stacked heels, he pointed out: “You can’t ‘no platform’ me.”
The artist’s target, if there is one in such a benevolent world view, is the growing tendency for opinions to be entrenched in identity politics: those people who start to speak by defining their own minority perspective, or victim status, are not helping, he believes.

The argument, with Perry, is always laid out like a jigsaw, sometimes visually. And it is often all the more persuasive for it. The second and third rows of the lecture hall were taken by 40 sixth-form students from local schools who had been attending an Orwell youth prize workshop for young writers that day. Instructed by Michael Callanan and Marina Lewycka, the Orange prizewinning author of A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian, they had already been told that getting a point over to your reader is a question of first getting them to engage – perhaps by surprising them with an unusual viewpoint, rather than by directly stating your opinions. They could not have watched a better example of that special skill.
Student Esme Kenny, 16, who goes to nearby Tapton School, was impressed. “It was really interesting. I was always wondering what was going to happen next and he covered a lot,” she said.
The body of Perry’s plan for recovery from the social shock of the Brexit vote is to tackle the rampant “diaphobia” he has detected. This is a technical term he purloined from Laing via his psychotherapist wife, Phillipa, and it describes the problematic fear of being changed by other people. It builds divisions quickly, he argued.
Our complex individual identities are only relevant, he suggests, in as far as they can be shared. In a moving moment of the lecture Perry discussed the pain of separation whenever a close bond between a couple is broken by death or illness. His own large woodcut, Reclining Artist, seems to express this fear of separation. The facial features and the nude bodies of Perry and his wife are shown merging together.
Perry’s parting shot was a return to home territory. As the new chancellor of the University of the Arts London, he was honour-bound to point out that culture, in both its broadest and its most particular sense, can bind us and aid empathy.
For one woman in the audience, Abigail Scott Paul, of the social thinktank the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Perry’s thoughts about the way arguments should be communicated were crucial. “We’ve realised at the foundation that facts and evidence about poverty, ‘statistical truth’ as Grayson described it, is not enough to shift public attitudes or to get the policy change we need to see,” she said. “With poverty levels staying pretty much the same for the past 25 years, that strategy has not worked. Just telling people ‘you’re wrong – here’s the evidence’ turns people off and doesn’t change minds.”
This weekend Perry is back to being a contemporary artist, with a show opening at Colchester’s First Site gallery. But it is clear it will not be long before this forthright transvestite ceramicist from Chelmsford is called upon once again to set us all straight.

Technology sector|The Observer|Amazon|Retail industry|Consumer spending|E-commerce|Internet|news,2017-11-19T00:05:46,guardian,Zoe Wood,"The online giant will have a real store in London for Black Friday. In this topsy-turvy retail world, innovation is now a necessity",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/19/amazon-high-street-shop-london,"As Amazon opens a guerrilla store, has the internet beaten the high street?",en,business|retail,,"The online giant will have a real store in London for Black Friday. In this topsy-turvy retail world, innovation is now a necessity
On London’s Oxford Street a row of glittering snowflakes guides shoppers along the golden mile of fashion and department stores. The 750,000 lights floating above Selfridges, John Lewis and Debenhams are a decades-old tradition but events like Black Friday have changed Christmas shopping for ever.
The UK high street has just experienced something of a watershed, what some have called its “Tesla moment”. Online fashion website Asos overtook Marks & Spencer in market value terms for the first time despite not having a single store to its name. The comparison with the automotive industry comes because electric carmaker Tesla moved ahead of the 114-year-old Ford Motor Company in market value earlier this year.
The growing might of the internet will be writ large when the £10bn battle for sales in Black Friday week is tapped out on websites rather than from bargain hunting in stores.
“Online has been a catalyst that has reinforced the fact that we have too many shops in the UK,” says Matthew Hopkinson, director at retail consultancy Local Data Company. “Around 10% of the UK retail stock is surplus to requirements, which equates to about 50,000 stores.”
Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news Read more
It’s a frightening statistic for an industry where jobs are already disappearing at an alarming rate. The retail workforce has shrunk from 3.2 million in 2008 to around 3 million today with the British Retail Consortium predicting another 900,000 jobs will disappear by 2025 as companies end their leases on unprofitable stores.
That pace of job reduction has accelerated this year, with the BRC’s most recent figures showing the biggest drop in hours worked and employment since it started keeping records in 2008, as the technological revolution in retail reduces demand for labour.
“The internet is the most powerful marketing channel we have ever seen,” says Hopkinson. “It brings with it a massive amount of convenience so you only have to go shopping for the things that you actually want to. You no longer have to do mundane shopping.”
Recent industry data shows retailers fighting a losing battle to lure customers into their stores with shopper numbers down more than 9% in October, according to the most recent figures from Ipsos Retail Performance’s shopper tracker.
One retail analyst likens the diverging fortunes of the physical and digital high street to Netflix sci-fi show Stranger Things where a malevolent alternative dimension, the “upside down”, is encroaching on everyday life. “Retail seems trapped, with a real world showing online sales booming and an upside down world showing increasingly scary results for high street stores,” says David Jinks, of ParcelCompare.
In a further inversion of the norm, some internet-only stores are selling their wares via seasonal pop-up shops. Amazon will open a guerrilla store in central London that will last as long as one of its Black Friday deals. The pop-up shop will showcase bestsellers in mock room sets as well as offer shoppers tutorials from “social media influencers” Lottie Tomlinson and Gizzi Erskine.
By the end of the year Britons will have spent nearly £60bn via their phones and tablets – a figure that equates to more than £1 in every £6 spent on the high street. The trend is expected to continue, with online sales predicted to hit almost £100bn by 2021, according to consultants at Retail Economics.
With the retail market barely growing, the web is sucking sales out of high street stores, making life more difficult for traditional stores such as M&S, Next and Debenhams, which have long dominated the high street. It also comes at a time when Britons are carefully monitoring their budgets because inflation is eroding their spending power.
Some chains have begun to take tough decisions about the future of their stores. M&S has said it will close 30 stores, while a further 45 are being downsized or converted into food-only outlets. But many analysts think retailers will have to go further given the pace of high street change. Mothercare, for example, plans to halve the size of its 150-store UK chain after more than 40% of its sales shifted online.
Retailers are following the consumers’ lead after watching online retail sales double over a five-year period. The growth in online spending also holds a mirror up to how we spend our free time. In 2010, 60% of adults went online every day. That figure is now 84%, according to the Office for National Statistics.
“It is the structural change in the way people interact with digital technology that is altering the retail industry,” says Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, who also points to a shift in spending to the so-called “experience economy” as Britons spend more on leisure, travel and entertainment.

Steve Howard, Ikea’s head of sustainability, caused ripples last year when he suggested households had reached saturation point. “If we look on a global basis, in the west we have probably hit peak stuff,” he told a conference. “We talk about peak oil. I’d say we’ve hit peak red meat, peak sugar, peak stuff … peak home furnishings.”
Until the Brexit blow to sterling, Britons had benefited from 20 years of falling prices as canny retailers imported vast quantities of goods produced cheaply in Asia. There is now an abundance of material possessions,” says Lim. “For the past two decades British shoppers have enjoyed persistent deflation so the economic value they attach to purchases is diminishing.”
He gives the example of people buying their first iPad, which was a much bigger deal than when they upgraded to their fourth or fifth model. This purchase fatigue is changing what we spend our money on as we relish holidays or treat ourselves to days out. In the early 1960s retail accounted for close to a third of Britons’ spending, but that figure is 24% today and is expected to fall further still.
Shifting priorities have seen retailers invest heavily in creating more dynamic store experiences to pull shoppers away from their screens. A recent example of the trend is John Lewis’s new Oxford store where more than a fifth of the 120,000 sq ft of selling space is devoted to 21 “services and experiences”, ranging from style advice to personalised Christmas baubles.
Some analysts argue the internet should no longer be seen as the enemy of the store. Amazon put a cat among the pigeons earlier this year when it swooped on organic food chain Whole Foods Market. The move showed that even the biggest of the online giants saw value in a physical store network.
Closer to home, supermarket chain Sainsbury’s swallowed Argos last year for £1.4bn as it looked to borrow the catalogue chain’s successful model, which marries stores, the web and super-fast delivery.
Argos chief executive John Rogers explains a new topsy-turvy retail landscape where 60% of orders originate online but two-thirds of those shoppers turn up in store to collect their toys, kettles and toasters. Despite a plethora of delivery options, 80% of its orders end up being fulfilled the old-fashioned way through the now combined Sainsbury’s and Argos store network.
Rogers says that it is no longer possible to “delineate” between online and physical sales as customers move seamlessly between the two worlds. “The majority of orders start online but are fulfilled in our stores,” he says. “I can’t overestimate the importance of that flexibility. I’m a big believer in stores but there is no question that online will continue to grow.”
In the coming days retailers will wage a fierce battle for Black Friday sales, an event that will be a litmus test for the key Christmas period, when many bank the lion’s share of their annual profits. Rogers is determined that Argos will be one of the winners from these first skirmishes, insisting that if you have the right products at the right prices, the demand is there.
“I think Christmas will be big this year, but it will come later,” he predicts of the nail-biting trading days ahead. “I would not write off stores.”

Until now.
In a development that will delight both music lovers and reform-minded Catholics, one of the church’s gender taboos has finally been broken. Cecilia Bartoli, one of Italy’s most celebrated classical singers, has become the first woman to perform inside the chapel with the all-male Sistine Chapel Choir, as part of a unique musical project which draws on ancient, neglected musical archives of the Catholic church.
On Friday night the mezzo-soprano joined the 20 men and 30 boys who make up the choir, among the oldest choral groups in the world, to sing Beata Viscera, by the Renaissance composer Pérotin.
A few days before, the five-time Grammy award-winner told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that she was “in seventh heaven” about the prospect of performing in the chapel, and [possibly] before Pope Francis.
“It’s a huge privilege,” she added. Bartoli’s dream of meeting Pope Francis was not fulfilled – he was unable to attend the performance – but the singer made a huge impact on the choir.
“She was incredible,” Mark Spyropoulos, the first British full-time member of the choir, told the Observer after the show. “She’s well known for her interpretations of early music and it was great for us to be recording with someone like that. Women sing with a different timbre to men, so to hear that sound, the wonderful richness that women sing with on that piece, is very unusual in the Sistine Chapel … because, of course, it’s an all-male choir.”
Spyropoulos, a former flower presenter at the Royal Opera House in London’s Covent Garden, was particularly enamoured by her presence, especially having presented flowers to her at the end of shows she performed there.
“And now to have sung with her – it was amazing.”

Bartoli’s voice also features on the pontifical choir’s 16-track Christmas CD, Veni Domine: Advent and Christmas at the Sistine Chapel, which was released in Italy in October and worldwide this month. The recording, made up of a repertoire of scores from manuscripts by the greatest composers of the Renaissance era, which are contained within the vast archive of the Vatican library, was produced in the chapel in part because of its unique acoustics, but also because three of the compositions had originally been produced to be sung there for papal celebrations and had never been performed in modern times.
“This new production, focusing on the liturgical time of Christmas, is based on the unique characteristic of translating into sound the manuscripts present in the Sistine Chapel archive, a truly precious treasure chest,” said Archbishop Georg Gänswein, prefect of the papal household, during a press conference at the Vatican on the day the album was released.
It is the third album produced in partnership with Universal Music Italia and the German classical music label Deutsche Grammophon, with proceeds from sales going to the papal charities.
“It’s ancient music, with its simplicity,” Bartoli told Corriere. “And to sing that music in the place it was conceived was fascinating.” She described the acoustics of the chapel as “generous, and ideal for this type of repertoire; the voice travels naturally”.
Federico Capitoni, a journalist and music critic for the daily newspaper La Repubblica, said that the inclusion of a woman in the choir was a “significant gesture of openness by the Vatican”. Once the decision had been taken, the 51-year-old Bartoli was an obvious choice. “Her voice is especially predisposed to the music from that period, as well as her character – the lightness and subtlety,” he told the Observer. “And she is probably the most famous Italian mezzo-soprano; it’s inevitable they chose her.”
The choice marked a monumental shift in a choir which formed in the 15th century and enjoyed a golden period during the Renaissance before suffering a decline in the second half of the 20th century, when it earned the unfortunate nickname of “the Sistine screamers”.
More recently, under the leadership of Monsignor Massimo Palombella, a Salesian priest appointed choirmaster by Pope Benedict in 2010, the group has been enjoying a revival, even undertaking its first tour of the US in 30 years in September. Nowadays, men no longer have to be ordained, unmarried or Italian to join the choir. So it was probably only a matter of time before a woman was allowed in, although it’s unlikely to be a regular occurrence.
“The problem is, our repertoire is written for men, with the bulk of it being written in the pre-15th century and 16th century,” said Spyropoulos, who joined the choir in 2015.
“As a choir in the Sistine we have to sing with a very aesthetic precedence, so it’s difficult to include women in this particular choir. Personally I’m a great advocate of women singing choral music – it’s fantastic. But this is really a question of the right timbre for this kind of music.”
In her interview with Corriere, Bartoli, who became artistic director of the Salzburg Whitsun Festival in 2012, spoke about the lack of women in orchestras. “There is still so much to do [in that respect],” she said.
Capitoni disputes this observation: “Her experience of things is no doubt different, but it’s a question of changing times. A few generations ago, there were few women but today I come across many who are studying music, singing and performing.”"
Russia|The Observer|Vladimir Putin|Europe|news,2017-11-19T00:04:46,guardian,Mark Townsend,Allegations seen as latest attempt to discredit hedge fund manager who has led global campaign for justice in the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/19/bill-browder-putin-accuses-three-murders-campaigner-sergei-magnitsky,Putin accuses British anti-corruption campaigner Browder of three murders,en,world|europe,,"Allegations seen as latest attempt to discredit hedge fund manager who has led global campaign for justice in the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has accused prominent British businessman Bill Browder of being a “serial killer” – the latest extraordinary attempt by the Kremlin to frame one of its most high-profile public enemies.
Court documents seen by the Observer reveal that Russian state investigators have named Browder, a London-based hedge fund manager, as the suspect behind the mysterious murders of three men.
All three deaths are linked to a £174m fraud believed to have involved Russian officials – a crime that was uncovered by Browder’s Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, in 2008. Magnitsky was subsequently imprisoned on charges widely considered to be false, and died in jail amid claims he was tortured.
Browder, once the largest foreign portfolio investor in Russia, has infuriated Putin by lobbying western governments to punish those responsible for Magnitsky’s death. A number of countries have imposed sanctions on individuals believed to be involved.
Drawn up by the Russian state’s powerful investigative committee, the court papers reveal that the three dead men are linked to the massive tax-fraud scheme in Russia discovered by Magnitsky, but name Browder – described as a “citizen of the UK” – as responsible for their deaths.
The documents, which contain details of the investigation into the murders, which happened in the aftermath of the fraud, state: “The determination of the circumstances of death of victims is directly connected with the examination of facts of commitment [sic] by Browder.”

Browder said the latest in several recent attempts to undermine him indicated Putin was becoming “delusional” in his anger over the repercussions that have arisen from the case. “Putin is so rattled by the Magnitsky sanctions that he has completely lost touch with reality,” he said.
The court documents outline an update into the investigation of the three linked deaths, which investigators have “found grounds to believe were of violent nature and occurred as a result of deliberate acts”.
The papers, written by a lead state investigator in April 2016 but which have only now come to light, name the three men as Octai Gasanov, 63, Valery Kurochkin, 55, and clothing salesman Sergei Korobeinikov, 67, who were killed between 2007 and 2008. Browder has not visited Russia since 2005, when he was banned as a threat to national security.
All three men have been linked to the organised crime group said to have helped facilitate the tax fraud and to have helped transfer the proceeds to a network of global bank accounts.
Details of the murders are scant but the court papers reveal that Gasanov was found dead at his Moscow apartment in October 2007, with the cause of death a mystery because no postmortem was carried out.
Kurochkin was found dead near Boryspil airport, outside Ukraine’s capital, Kiev, in April 2008. His death certificate says he died from cirrhosis. Travel records have previously revealed that Kurochkin travelled to the Ukraine in March 2008 with other members of the syndicate believed to be involved with the theft of the “Magnitsky money”. The return journey was made by all the group members except Kurochkin.
Six months later, on 24 September, Korobeinikov died after falling from a tall building “under construction during unidentified circumstances”. The court papers refer to “coercive forces” as possibly being behind the “spontaneous fall”.
The Magnitsky case gained significant prominence this summer after it emerged that a lawyer supporting the Russian government’s position had met senior figures in Donald Trump’s US presidential campaign, including Trump’s son and son-in-law.
Magnitsky’s death had previously prompted Browder to work with the US Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act, which levied targeted sanctions against powerful players in Russia and was most recently adopted by Canada."

But despite – or perhaps because of – the film’s musicality, Dreyer was dissatisfied with any score provided for it, and since his death in 1968, countless composers have struggled to produce that elusive perfect soundtrack.
Joan of Arc: striking the right note for a silent film classic Read more
The latest to take up the challenge is the Orlando Consort’s baritone Donald Greig who has assembled a score from the vocal and choral music of Joan’s own own day, which the Consort performs live, under the title Voices Appeared, with screenings of the film. Much of it works wonderfully well. Plainchant unfolds in tandem with Dreyer’s tracking shots round the Rouen courtroom. Babbled litanies suggest the surreptitious whispers of Joan’s judges, and a spattering of hard Latin consonants is timed exactly to the moment when one of her persecutors spits in her face.
Greig fully understands the fluctuating nature of cinematic tension, and nothing is allowed to detract from Renée Maria Falconetti’s harrowing central performance as Joan, or the beauty of the young Antonin Artaud as her comforter Massieu. Only towards the end does Greig deploy disjunction: the music slows in anticipation of Joan’s final spiritual release, as Dreyer picks up speed in the climactic montage that cuts between her burning and the violent response of the onlooking crowd. It feels a bit self-conscious after what has gone before, but otherwise this is an exceptional achievement that reminds us just how potent the combination of silent film and live music can be."

Steven Wilson: Hand. Cannot. Erase review – sonic and spiritual modernity Read more
The first half of this three-hour marathon consists of 2015 Top 20 album Hand. Cannot. Erase., inspired by the terrible story of Joyce Carol Vincent, a popular young woman who lay dead in her apartment undiscovered for three years. The songs – accompanied by powerful films featuring a girl wearing a Love Will Tear Us Apart T-shirt – pick at the dystopian alienation in modern life. Routine, Transcience and Happy Returns are so heartbreakingly beautiful that the interval is presumably to allow people a quiet weep.
The second half draws on recent mini-album 4 1/2 and his treasure box back catalogue, including Porcupine Tree songs such as the catchy Don’t Hate Me and 2005’s lovely Lazarus, touchingly dedicated to David Bowie.
Should the intensity threaten to become relentless, the unfeasibly youthful, long-haired, barefoot, bespectacled 48-year-old makes a droll raconteur. He jokes about sending a photo of the cheering crowd to the “chicks that worship me” and tells toilet-goers of his fears about audience incontinence. In a rare serious moment, though, he pinpoints his considerable appeal: “I’ve always felt that the saddest music can be the most uplifting.”"

They throw the instructions away.

As it happens, the fireworks they set off are more beautiful than perilous. Triggered by moments of greatest crisis in the true stories of George, who ditches a dream job that is making him ill, and John, who swaps the daily grind for a foreign adventure, the pyrotechnics create billowing clouds of colour that stand for the characters’ hidden emotional states.
Such moments are both striking and poignant. A jar of yellow smoke magically turns into candyfloss, which Smith eats as if consuming her own inner turmoil. Watt, meanwhile, gives new meaning to the words “smoking jacket” when she hooks herself up to a machine that sends wisps of smoke seeping through the fabric of her coat like streams of repressed angst.
The most powerful image is self-generated. Taped into a boiler suit, Watt places a funnel in her mouth, loads it with paint powder and blows. As she splutters and coughs, she creates a picture that is at once gorgeous and full of jeopardy. It’s a contradiction that sums up the uncertainty behind every life-changing decision we make.
How You Gonna Live Your Dash (the dash being the line that connects the dates of birth and death on a gravestone) reflects and refracts this theme, bouncing it around imaginatively and playfully, half-comic, half-serious. If there’s a downside, it’s that it toys with the ideas rather than take them to a deeper level. For all its dazzle and spark, it doesn’t quite convince you of the importance of the changes it describes."

• Your editorial recognising the courage of those who refused to fight failed to mention the most lion-hearted of them all. In the first world war, Lance Corporal William Coltman’s awards of the VC, DCM and Bar, and MM and Bar, made him the British armed forces’ most decorated other-rank, a distinction he still holds.
Deep religious convictions would not allow him to kill, so he served throughout the conflict as an unarmed stretcher bearer. Personal modesty and the authorities’ problem with the contradiction of a hero who would not take up arms means that today he is the bravest soldier most people have never heard of.

• Over five decades of activism on the left I’ve come across Maoists from time to time. Hardly a numerous trend in Britain, they were for the most part good socialists, albeit one could hardly agree with their view of China. The case of convicted sex attacker Aravindan Balakrishnan is a reminder that unlike “official” British communism, in which Moscow showed some interest, Beijing had little concern for its supporters elsewhere in the world. Consequently they could, and sometimes did, claim all manner of views, and in the case of Balakrishnan much worse than that, to be somehow “Maoist”. A better guide was not what they said but what, if anything, they did.

How the left uses them is up to us. The London mayoral elections could turn into a referendum on housing: no other issue in any other city could unite so many people across such a fundamental question. What is the concentration of wealth in ever fewer hands doing to the way you live, the future you can look forward to, the way your children will live? Do you see life getting easier or harder? Do you accept it as inevitable? And if not, what avenues for change are you ready to explore?
The EU referendum could, like the Scottish referendum, become a conversation about what a good Europe – and, by extension, a good United Kingdom – would look like. It could be a debate about the very purpose of international cooperation: what it could mean for wages and tax, privatisation and commonly held assets. Were we minded to discuss a post-capitalist sharing economy, in which renewable energy moved freely across borders and the fruits of technological advance moved beyond appropriation by monopolies, this would be the place to start.
Slowly but surely, Corbyn has taken control of Labour. So, what next? | Rafael Behr Read more
Trident could trigger new thinking about foreign policy, if we could only allow ourselves to say out loud one blindingly obvious fact: that the cold war conditions that made the threat of mass annihilation look like a sensible compact between hostile nations no longer pertain.
This is, in short, a time when we could overturn sclerotic norms and replace them with genuinely modern, ambitious thinking. The left could do that. Or we could allow ourselves to be diverted down paths to nowhere, chasing sticks thrown by gleeful opponents: is Sadiq Khan as big a leftie as Jeremy Corbyn? How will they ever work together when they don’t think exactly the same thing? What’s the constitutional basis for a Labour coup? How can the left support an EU that stiffed Greece and has lost its humanitarian heart? If there is one thing easier than leveraging lefties’ natural anti-authoritarianism, it is opening up the fissures between them to turn them into chasms.
In 2003 Britney Spears said of George Bush: “Honestly, I think we should just trust our president and every decision that he makes, and support that.” I was fascinated by the remark, and remember worrying at it, like a scab, Googling it to check the wording (the search terms “Britney” and “Bush” led to a while in the wilderness, let me tell you). I thought I was interested in how good conservatives are at yielding to authority, but I was really interested in my own sense of revulsion. To support anybody in every decision that he made would, to me, be indivisible from being dead.
We need to find our own harmony that can accommodate audible difference
In normal times, the naturally subversive person never has to confront the question of whether he or she is capable of obedience, because the sort of person he or she would obey would never be in power. These are not normal times: Corbyn, avowedly anti-establishment, is the leader of the opposition. The prevailing convention is to pretend that he’s just a comical sideshow, and normal opposition will resume in due course. But sooner or later, reality will catch up with this self-styled “realistic” view.
Corbyn’s more pressing problem is that the only place he will find support is among people who far prefer to critique. How he deals with that – accounts of how long it takes him to fire someone, unable to do so until they’ve agreed that he’s right, point to a person who is less comfortable with authority than anyone – has been the subject of endless scornful commentary. Yet everyone on the progressive side – whether in the parliamentary Labour party, the constituency party or not a member at all, merely sympathetic to the ideas – needs to consider how we deal with it. Is a natural reluctance to cheerleading allowing us to be neutralised?
Who doesn't want to see Jeremy Corbyn elected? It would be a glorious six-day reign | Frankie Boyle Read more
And without question, there are Labour MPs whose opposition to the leader is implacable, who disagree with him profoundly on matters of principle. Whether or not we call those people Tories or closet Tories or misdirected Lib Dems is irrelevant. The salient point is that they do not describe the full party range, which also includes MPs who agree with many of Corbyn’s ideas but worry about his electability, who cleave to the same fundamentals but worry about the delivery.
These are the MPs who worry about how it plays when Corbyn refuses to endorse shoot to kill, rather than considering whether shoot to kill is a large enough or pressing enough issue to divide on; MPs who support Trident because they don’t want to be associated with peaceniks, not because they are deeply wedded to weapons of mass destruction.
It is likely – indeed, I’d say it was a certainty – that there are Conservative MPs who oppose Trident but wouldn’t dream of making an issue of it. The ability of the right to gloss over its internal differences is, frankly, awe inspiring: in a recent debate about social housing, Cameron accused Corbyn of being a small-c conservative. That’s probably what most of his party has written on their CVs, and he was using it as an insult. Nobody uttered a squeak.
It’s impressive, but it’s inimitable: the left cannot mimic the obedience of the right, and nor can we copy their pursuit of unity for its own sake. We need to find our own kind of loyalty that doesn’t preclude critical distance; our own harmony that can accommodate audible difference. We are in a time of unique opportunity, brought not just by the new Labour leadership but a constellation of flashpoints that could light up politics. This doesn’t need all of us to agree; it just needs all of us to be in."
US elections 2016|Opinion|Hillary Clinton|Donald Trump|US politics|Iowa|Ted Cruz|editorials,2016-01-31T19:27:44,guardian,,Editorial: Both of America’s main political parties need to ask themselves big questions that reflect changed times not old battles. Only the Democrats seem capable of doing so,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/31/the-guardian-view-on-the-us-election-today-iowa-tomorrow-the-white-house,"The Guardian view on the US election: today Iowa, tomorrow the White House",en,opinion|editorials,,"In a more perfect democracy than America’s dysfunctional system, it might be possible to depict the 2016 US presidential election process that finally begins in earnest in Iowa this week as an opportunity. The six months before the nominating conventions could enable two contrastingly bruised parties to reflect on their past, to look to their future and to plot paths and priorities for America and the world that will engage a majority of voters. Both Republicans and Democrats have much to reflect on: the Republicans on why they so often have failed to win recent presidential contests; the Democrats on why victory in four of the last six White House races has not been matched by congressional success but instead marked by serious reverses.
Hillary Clinton goes into the process as the favourite to emerge in July with the Democratic nomination. She has a formidable record. The opportunity to elect her as America’s first female president is historic. But she is also a lacklustre campaigner, a divisive figure whom many mistrust, and an establishment candidate in an era in which voters across the world are looking to outsiders as never before.
Mrs Clinton is also the candidate of continuity with a more prosperous era in which her party embraced corporate America, not least when her husband was president. Those days are in the past now, and America feels more threatened and unequal than it did in the boom years following the cold war. The country is still big, powerful and rich; but median household income is almost $4,000 lower than eight years ago and college leavers are on average $35,000 in the red. The legacy of her support for unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan still lingers, as it did in 2008.
Hence the appeal of the leftwing Bernie Sanders. He is mounting a strong challenge and may do well in the early contests. But at least Mr Sanders forces the Democrats to focus on the right big question raised through the Obama years: how to equip their party to try to build a fairer and more inclusive America in the face of the continuing radicalisation of American conservatism.
The Republicans, by contrast, are not even close to asking the right questions. For at least 50 years, as the Republican writer Henry Olsen puts it, the party has wrestled with whether to be the vehicle for the conservative movement. That question has dominated the run-up to Iowa. But it is the wrong question. As the liberal writer EJ Dionne says in a recent book, many Republicans remain in thrall to a narrative of failure and betrayal, yearning to return “to the government and the economy of the 1890s, the cultural norms of the 1950s, and, in more recent times, the ethnic makeup of the country in the 1940s”. The front-running candidate of this wing of the party is Ted Cruz, a Texan conservative who terrifies much of the Republican establishment.
Donald Trump, who has dominated the contest and who may now be poised to convert his poll ratings into nomination pledges, terrifies the establishment for a different reason. For Mr Trump, conservatism is secondary to populism. His platform is to attack migrants, Muslims, political correctness, the establishment (of left and right) and to put the grievances of disgruntled white working- and middle-class male voters first. The Republican establishment, from conservative to very conservative, loathes this. But the party’s larger problem is that neither Mr Trump nor Mr Cruz offers a route back to the electorate from long years of collective conservative psychodrama. For that reason, Senator Marco Rubio is one of a handful who may yet emerge as a compromise candidate.
The two parties need to use the coming months to ask themselves the right questions. Yet if the sparring of the past few months in the run-up to Iowa this week and New Hampshire next is any guide, only one of the parties seems able to conduct anything close to what is needed. That party is the Democrats. The Republicans, by contrast, continue to fall far short, often scarily so."
Social care|Opinion|Local elections|Local government|NHS|Local politics|Health|editorials,2016-01-31T19:27:32,guardian,,Editorial: Politicians in Whitehall and the town hall are heading for conflict over the costs of looking after the elderly,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/31/the-guardian-view-on-social-care-and-the-nhs-cant-pay-wont-pay,"The Guardian view on social care and the NHS: can’t pay, won’t pay",en,opinion|editorials,,"For the NHS, 2016 is regarded as a “year of opportunity”. That is because it is the start of the five-year electoral cycle, a time for the kind of difficult choices that will only be sanctioned by a health secretary not yet worrying about the next election. But for local government, 2016 is the very opposite. In every part of the United Kingdom there are elections. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, all the devolved bodies face a vote. There will be a new London mayor; and many of England’s local councillors face re-election. That gives the budget-setting season, which will preoccupy most councils for most of this month, a particular significance. In particular, it will have an impact on the NHS: generally the link between what councils spend and the health service is opaque. This year, it should be spelled out in headlines.
Social care catastrophe won’t be solved by integration with healthcare services | Letters Read more
Around 150 English councils have responsibility for social care and last autumn the chancellor, George Osborne, introduced a 2% social care precept into the council tax. Levying it is optional, but without it the elderly or disabled people who rely on social care will face, say, fewer, shorter visits from care workers, or lose their day centre. And while the link between overstretched social care and extra cost for the NHS is not exact, over the past five years, spending on social care has been cut in real terms by 8.7%, while – to take just one figure that emerged last week – the number of A&E admissions of people over 90 has gone up by 61%. Lack of social care means patients ready to go home have to stay in hospital; that in turn often means a bed crisis and cancelled operations. The impact on hospital finances is heavy – a wicked combination of unnecessary spending from inappropriately occupied beds and lost income from cancelled surgery. Those are the biggest factors behind the financial crisis engulfing NHS trusts which is heading fast towards £2bn. So what councils decide to spend, and whether or not they pass on any increase in spending to their council tax payers, is likely to have a profound impact on the fortunes of the NHS too.
But in an election year, raising council tax is a tough option. In Scotland, where the SNP is hoping for a second outright victory, John Swinney, the finance secretary, has taken out the big stick. For the eighth successive year, he has demanded a tax freeze across the 32 councils, or they face losing £400m of funding that is earmarked for key objectives like progress towards integrating health and social care and paying the Scottish living wage of £8.25 to all care workers.
In England, according to preliminary findings from a survey by the Local Government Information Unit, almost all councils responsible for social care will levy the 2% precept. But that is only the beginning of the struggle to find enough cash to meet the cost of the ageing and disabled population which, the King’s Fund estimates, increases at around 3% a year. On this thinktank’s estimates, every council needs to increase council tax by both the 1.9% that is permitted without triggering a referendum, as well as the 2% of the new social care levy. And, in order to meet the rapidly rising costs of caring for older people, they need to go on doing that every year for the next four years.
A crisis in funding for the health service now seems highly likely to collide, within the next five years, with a crisis in funding for local councils. Because social care is either paid by individuals directly or by councils, while healthcare is funded by Whitehall out of taxes, when individuals – or their local authorities – lack the resources, the NHS is left to pick up the pieces. There are alternatives: first, budgets for health and social care could be combined, as successive inquiries have recommended. But that has been parked in the too-hard tray; the second, to integrate the services so that older people only end up in hospital when that is where they need to be, is a work in progress. But it’s slow, difficult and, above all, costly."
Mental health|The first fight|Croatia|Europe|Health|features,2017-11-19T00:04:46,guardian,Tracy Mcveigh,It was the oldest asylum in the Balkans. Now the doors are unlocked and patients are living new lives in the community,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/19/croatia-mental-health-pioneering-centre,‘We give people their humanity back’: inside Croatia’s pioneering mental health centre,en,world|europe,,"It was the oldest asylum in the Balkans. Now the doors are unlocked and patients are living new lives in the community
High walls still surround the oldest asylum in the Balkans, an 18th-century building pocked with the artillery scars of last century’s civil war, but the gates are no longer locked. Handles have been replaced on internal doors and bars removed from windows.
“The jail,” said Darko Kovaoic, a 53-year-old poet with schizophrenia who lives here, “has broken open.”
The institution in Osijek, eastern Croatia, is run by Ladislav Lamza, a former social worker who is taking on the government, the health minister, and his own staff to transform the lives of his “beneficiaries” – the patients of what was until recently an old-style asylum.
It was in May 2015 that Lamza ripped down the sign outside – replacing “Home for the Insane” with “Centre for People Like Us” and began moving people out.
“We express many things in that small sentence,” said Lamza. “Because what we have done for the past two centuries is the opposite. We’ve said: ‘You are not like us, you are ugly and mad and I’m not like you.’ This is where we exclude, stigmatise and restrain people for the rest of their lives.
“We have people in need and we provide inappropriate help and the result is catastrophic. I never knew anyone who was rehabilitated. We make equality between criminals and people with disabilities.”
Lamza’s transformation of the centre caused shock and upset: one member of staff pointed out that these were people who should have been “exterminated”.
In four years, 172 out of 200 people have been successfully moved into shared flats dotted around the small city, with carers from the centre visiting them as needed.
As his institution emptied, Lamza ditched the metal bed frames and stained mattresses. Although the paint still peels and the furniture is scratched and sagged, he has turned the bleak, soulless wards into rooms for day classes, a library and a bright cafe where former patients demonstrate how to make pancakes and brew tea for other ex-patients who come by daily to grow cabbages in the gardens or to chat with staff. Staff are no longer janitors, nurses, cooks or cleaners, but all re now “care assistants”. The transformation, says Butkovic Jadranka – formerly a hairdresser here, now running sewing classes and shopping and theatre trips – is amazing.

“When we first heard of the director’s plans, I was fearful, everyone was fearful, we thought perhaps he had gone a little crazy. But now everything is completely different. Before it was like they were objects, slightly out of focus objects. Just numbers. Like on a conveyer belt. I never asked anyone’s name. Now they are my friends. People are not dangerous lunatics, they have become citizens, they have become neighbours.”
It is 10 years since Croatia signed the UN’s Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities but Osijek is the only one of Croatia’s 24 mental health institutions, which house a total of 6,700 people, implementing its spirit. “We signed this with our fingers crossed behind our backs. The government still wants people locked up, locked away. People with disabilities, whether mental health or physical, have rights. There are four reasons why inclusion is better than exclusion,” said Lamza. “It’s better for a person, it’s better for the community, it’s legal, it’s cheaper.” He says the cost per person per month in an institution is $1,260 (£950). “In the community, even with the maximum 24-hour support, it is $1,020.
“The first day I let people go I didn’t sleep: will she hurt someone, will he cope? But there have been no problems. People have thanked us for giving them the best neighbours they have ever had!”
After 12 years in institutions, Branka Reljan, 55, has spent three years living in the community, in a shared flat with her partner Drazenko Tevlli. She speaks fluent German and English but has suffered mental health breakdowns since university and has let go of old ambitions. Now the couple take great delight in visiting cafes and shops. “We met in the institution but love is not allowed so we lived a secret for 11 years. I say I was in prison before. Now I love to make apple pies and buy spices and oils for cooking. It is wonderful for us to have our own keys, to buy fresh juice and to take a bus. We are satisfied with our neighbours. We are happy.”

If other asylums in Croatia had any desire to follow Lamza’s care in the community model it would be more difficult. Most were built far from towns.
Rada Matos is the director of Ljeskovica home for mentally ill adults, deep in the Pozega forest, an hour’s drive from Osijek. Lamza describes it as “a warehouse for lost souls”. Matos says she does her best for the 284 people here but points out that Croatia is a poor country and mental health is both under-resourced and stigmatised. “We have no psychologists and no psychiatrists, no professional is interested in coming out here to work, yet perversely we are the main employer in the area for unskilled workers. It’s too far for relatives to visit and there is no community for people to live in even if I had the resources to try. There is a tiny village of uneducated people to whom this is the madhouse.”
There is a long waiting list to come here but few leave. “Maybe two a year,” she said. “We try to explain mental health is an illness, we invite in families, school groups. But what I’d really need to do is move this building somewhere else, somewhere where there is a community.”
Around the grounds and in the corridors, people stand or wander in shabby clothes too big or too small. Miryama Nikoli, 38, is new to Ljeskovica but has been institutionalised for 18 years. Eyes glazed by medication that hasn’t been changed in all that time, she talks to everyone about her daughter, taken away as a baby. “I was sick because of my nerves but now I suffer because of my baby,” she says. “I drink the medicine but I want to see her again.” Matos pulls out her file; her background is heart-breaking and abusive. One line mentions the child, who will now be 18. The file contains four A4 pages.
In Osijek the belief is that lives are better on the outside. Care assistant Vlatka Griner said the hardest task in moving people into the community was to make them use chairs: “At the asylum, they squat in the corridors, smoking. Squat, smoke, move a bit and squat again. What else did they have to do? In only slippers, just slippers because they never went out. When they are in the apartments the hard thing is to get people to sit in chairs. It can take a good two months.
“Then they go to the shops, buy their own food, buy their own clothes, run their own lives. Brush their hair. They’re unrecognisable.”
‘Love was not allowed in the institution. Now we are outside we have our own keys and take a bus. We are happy’
It is not a solution for everyone. Back in Osijek, Zdenko Kovac, 64, is a convicted murderer and, although he claims the scars on his head are from an axe wielded by his wife and he is not deemed dangerous enough for a secure hospital, he has failed to cope outside and is back in the institution where he wants to stay “until I die”.
“He is someone I worry about,” admits Lamza, “he wants to stay and ideally he will.” For others, it was never the right place. Luka Bobanovic, 36, caught a fever aged seven that left him brain-damaged. His mother handed him over to state care and he has been bounced around from institution to institution. “When he came to us he was very disturbed,” said Lamza. “Eight times Luka went through a door or window, either him chasing staff or them chasing him. The doctor told staff to tie him to his bed. I found him like that, tied to his bed, crying for his mamma. The staff shrugged and told me ‘we are scared of him’.”
Now he lives in a small bungalow with three other beneficiaries and round-the-clock care.“Our work doesn’t end when people live outside the institution,” said Lamza. “We are supporting them to live like every citizen of this town, to fall in love, dance, eat pancakes. I want to give people back a reason to live. That is what we have been taking from them, their humanity.
“I’m ashamed of how people lived before, but I’m happy,” Lamza said, “because they’re happy.”"
Roy Moore|The Observer|Alabama|US politics|Donald Trump|Republicans|US Senate|features,2017-11-18T14:04:31,guardian,David Smith,Many Alabama Republicans remain loyal to the embattled Senate candidate – but others resent the way Moore’s behaviour reinforces the cliches about their state,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/18/alabama-roy-moore-dispatch,Dispatch from Alabama: 'Roy Moore plays into the stereotypes the rest of the world has about us',en,world|US,,"Two young boys in suits and ties, and two young girls in dresses, sang about the love of God. A woman turned to the person next to her and asked: “How can you look at these children and not believe?” On the back wall of the gym hung a huge stars and stripes; on the sides were two basketball hoops; and at the front a sign proclaimed: “GOD SAVE AMERICA.”
Opinions clash in Roy Moore's home town: 'There's a lot of rumors in small-town Alabama' Read more
About 400 people had gathered for the religious revival in Jackson, deep in the countryside of southern Alabama, on Tuesday night. A male trio hymned “back to the old-time Christian way”. American and Christian flags were carried in as a choir of about 50 children sang of faith from sea to shining sea, punctuated by appreciative exclamations. Then a slick Texan preacher, tanned and without a hair out of place, warmed up the audience with some flattery: “Anybody who’s got a Walmart this close to church is not a small town.”
The main act was Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for the US Senate in Alabama. Facing accusations of sexual misconduct toward women in their teens when he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s, his name is now anathema to the Washington political establishment. Moore denies the misconduct allegations. But here, in a rural outpost of the faithful south, he was seen as a martyr. “After fortysomething years of fighting this battle, I’m now facing allegations, and that’s all the press want to talk about,” said Moore, wearing a dark suit and red tie. “I want to talk about the issues. I want to talk about where this country’s going, and if we don’t come back to God, we’re not going anywhere.”
This was the Observer’s first stop on a road trip through one of America’s poorest states, where mile after mile of grassy plains, woodlands and rivers are punctuated by modest towns and churches of every shape and size. The currents that swept Donald Trump to victory by 28 percentage points in last year’s presidential election here are keeping Moore afloat too. It is a fusion of patriotism and religion combined with contrariness, grievance and desire to repudiate meddling elites.
It comes as a shock to people that I can speak in complete sentences, I have teeth and I’m not married to my cousin Larisa Thomason
David Webb, pastor of the Walker Springs Road Baptist church, which hosted Tuesday’s event with Moore, said: “I’m sure there’s a lot of stereotypes about Alabama; I had them when I moved here from Texas. But it’s beautiful country and people are wonderful. We have faith, we believe God, we believe our Bible and we stand for truth. Just because somebody rises up, we get attacked and people think that we’re hatemongers, but we’re not. We hate sin but we love people and sometimes that gets misunderstood in society.”
Moore has taken a hit in the polls but local Republican officials are standing by him, giving him a fighting chance of holding off Democratic rival Doug Jones on 12 December. For many here the maverick candidate, opposed to abortion and homosexuality, represents a courageous defender of values they regard as under siege from the liberal classes. William Wright, helping with logistics at the church, said: “We see this as a scapegoat, a group of people that have come together because they’re scared of what he’s going to do, and that includes Republicans.”
Wright, 49, a former millwright, had an appearance from central casting: long grey beard and checked shirt beneath denim dungarees, finessed with a red carnation. “The state of Alabama is in the middle of the Bible belt; there’s a church on every corner,” he continued. “It’s easy to judge from afar. Stereotyping has been going on since the civil war and we’re looked down on as second-rate citizens.”

Wright voted for Trump and describes himself “ecstatic” at the president’s performance so far. His hardline interpretation of the Bible did not shift when his daughter, Laci, now 28, came out as gay. “We went through a long mourning period. You have hopes and dreams for your daughter, like marriage and children. She knows I love her and will always support her. I would die for my daughter in a split second. I love her girlfriend but that doesn’t mean we have to agree: I’m totally against lesbianism and homosexuality and would oppose them getting married.”
Moore, 70, has long been a divisive figure. He was twice ousted as chief justice of the Alabama supreme court for defying court orders, first in 2003 over his insistence that a Ten Commandments monument be placed on the grounds of the state judicial building, and then last year for trying to defy the US supreme court ruling that legalised gay marriage. Even Trump endorsed his rival, Luther Strange, in the Republican primary. The avalanche of sex allegations – including that he abused a 14-year-old girl when he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney – has led Republican central command to ostracise him.
Quick Guide Gay bans and praise for Putin: the world according to Roy Moore Show Hide Homosexuality should be illegal In 2005, Moore said: “Homosexual conduct should be illegal.” In an interview televised on C-Span, Moore added: “It is immoral. It is defined by the law as detestable.” During a debate in September 2017, he went out of his way to bemoan the fact that “sodomy [and] sexual perversion sweep the land”. September 11 attacks as divine punishment In a speech in February, Moore appeared to suggest that the terrorist attacks of September 11 were the result of divine retribution against the United States and prophesized in the Book of Isaiah. In comments first reported by CNN, Moore quoted Isaiah 30:12-13, saying: “Because you have despised His word and trust in perverseness and oppression, and say thereon ... therefore this iniquity will be to you as a breach ready to fall, swell out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instance.” Moore then noted: “Sounds a little bit like the Pentagon, whose breaking came suddenly at an instance, doesn’t it?” He added: “If you think that’s coincidence, if you go to verse 25: ‘There should be up on every high mountain and upon every hill, rivers and streams of water in the day of the great slaughter when the towers will fall.’"" Praise for Putin In an interview with the Guardian in August, Moore praised Putin for his views on gay rights. “Maybe Putin is right. Maybe he’s more akin to me than I know.” The comments came after Moore suggested the United States could be described as “the focus of evil in the world” because “we promote a lot of bad things”. Moore specifically named gay marriage as one of those “bad things”.
'Reds and yellows’ At a rally earlier in September, Moore talked about “reds and yellows fighting” while discussing racial division in the United States. Moore justified this on Twitter by citing lyrics from the song Jesus Loves the Little Children. He wrote “Red, yellow, black and white they are precious in His sight. Jesus loves the little children of the world. This is the Gospel.” Tracking livestock is communism In 2006, Moore condemned a proposal for a national ID system for animals as “more identifiable with communism than free enterprise”. The proposal received attention after a cow in Alabama had been diagnosed with mad cow disease. Moore, who was then running for governor, was skeptical that the outbreak was real. Instead, Moore suggested it was a ruse intended to promote the tracking system.
Yet Alabama Republicans, some local evangelicals and many voters there remain loyal. On Friday, his wife Kayla spoke at a “Women for Moore” rally, describing the Vietnam veteran as “an officer and a gentleman”. Supporters have blamed a witch-hunt and, drawing from Trump’s playbook, sought to blame the media. In a crude attempt to discredit journalists, a fake robo-caller named “Bernie Bernstein”, complete with Jewish New York accent, claims to be a Washington Post reporter seeking women “willing to make damaging remarks” about Moore in exchange for money.
It is a baffling business to much of the nation and does little to challenge cliches of Alabama as redneck, backward and bigoted. Indeed, in the Trump era, the state has become something of a punchbag for frustrated liberals. Last weekend the TV comedy show Saturday Night Live’s opening sketch featured a parody of Moore and Jeff Beauregard Sessions, Trump’s attorney general, who told him: “I’m Alabama, but you – you, sir, are too Alabama.” Sessions then pulled out a stuffed possum that he called “papa” and sought its advice.
Ambrosia Starling, an Alabama drag queen whom Moore named as his nemesis over LGBT rights, caught the sketch. “I laughed the first time I watched it and I cried the second time I watched it,” she said. “It hit me they were telling the naked truth about how these people behave.
“We have a lot of insecure people who desperately need someone to look down on and they will support any politician who gives them a licence to hate. Alabama’s problems are indicative of the America’s problems. I’ve always said discrimination in America will not end until it ends in Alabama.”
But Starling, 45, is living proof of what Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie called “the danger of a single story”, whether applied to a state, country or continent. She lives in Dothan in the county where Moore performed best in the Republican primary. But she often goes out in “half-drag” and “can count on one hand in 23 years the number of times someone has given me a dirty look and only once has someone said anything”.
Starling, who is Christian, added: “There are a lot of Christians in Alabama who believe the same I do, but I feel that people like Roy Moore drown them out. He has made a very good living for a very long time feeding off the insecurities and motivations of hatred and bigotry.”
Since its humiliation during post-civil war Reconstruction, Alabama has had a reputation for rebelliousness and defiance of Washington. It was a Ku Klux Klan stronghold where, in 1963, demagogic governor George Wallace called for “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever”. But it was also the crucible of the civil rights struggle. Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man on a crowded bus in Montgomery in 1955; “freedom riders” protesting Jim Crow laws were attacked in Anniston in 1961; four young African American girls were killed in the bombing of a Baptist church in Birmingham in 1963 (Jones, as US attorney for North Alabama, brought murder charges against the last two living suspects); hundreds braved police violence to march for voting rights in Selma in 1965.
Diane McWhorter, who grew up in Birmingham and is the author of Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, the Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution, noted the city’s history as the industrial centre of the south and the related rise of trade unionism. “What made Alabama different from other deep south states is that it did have this pesky progressive tradition,” she said.
For the state to have gone through so much agony and now be in this position is “deeply heartbreaking”, McWhorter added, describing Alabama as something of a bellwether for the nation. “Looking back at George Wallace, we thought he was a fading and terrible relic, but he’s now in the White House, effectively. After Trump, we’re all Alabamians now.”
Today Birmingham – named after the UK city – has shaken off its reputation as “Bombingham”, though not the legacy of racial segregation. It is enjoying cultural and economic rejuvenation with downtown loft developments, a new baseball stadium and thriving restaurant scene. Like Austin in Texas or Nashville in Tennessee, it is an island of urban Democratic blue surrounded by rural Republican red.
Drinking in the Atomic Bar & Lounge, which opened earlier this year featuring a Sgt Pepper collage incorporating local personalities, and a “jungle” section complete with sounds from the wild, Brent Boyd reflected: “We’re cannon fodder. Unfortunately our politics get talked about more loudly than the positive things that go on here. People love the sensationalism that goes on in the south: attitudes that seem so foreign to the rest of the nation, but I’m not sure the last election didn’t prove those attitudes persist across the nation and just need to be seen under the microscope.”

Boyd, 51, is all too aware of the way Alabamians – with their distinctive southern drawl – are regarded by the rest of the country. “Many of us resent it because many times it’s based on the way we sound. I worked after college to train my accent because of the perception that, if I talk more slowly, I’m not as intelligent as other people.”
Boyd’s past job for a candle manufacturer took him to 24 states. “Almost everywhere I would go in the late 1990s, early 2000s, I would say I’m from Birmingham, Alabama, and they would either apologise or go: ‘What was that like?’ When I decided to start my own business, that question stuck in my head. I decided to change the perception of what Birmingham is for those visiting.”
In 2004 Boyd set up a media company including a TV station, city guide and annual magazine distributed to 13,000 hotel rooms. “It really was my small attempt to take control of the narrative and shine a light on the amazing culinary scene here.”
Boyd and others are frustrated that Moore’s behaviour reverts the narrative to type. Larisa Thomason, owner and administrator of the Left in Alabama blog, said: “Roy Moore represents the very worst of Alabama: not everybody here is like him. It’s really embarrassing to us all. He plays into the stereotypes the rest of the world has about the state and he knows he’s doing it.”

But she understands the appeal of figures such as Trump and Moore to voters who lack services, such as broadband, that many Americans now take for granted. “People in the rural areas don’t have opportunities for decent jobs and the schools are not good. You watch TV and see the world passing you by and the next moment you’re voting for Donald Trump.”
Thomason has also been on the receiving end of prejudice when she travels out of state. “It comes as a shock to people that I can speak in complete sentences, I have teeth and I’m not married to my cousin. They say, ‘You don’t sound like you’re from Alabama’, as if that’s a cool thing. They see the stereotypes on TV and, unfortunately, those stereotypes are a real thing in the sense that politicians play on them to get elected.”
If there’s one stereotype that seems a good bet, it’s that Christianity (along with American football) is all pervasive here. Thomason lives near Huntsville, where “you can’t swing a pillow case without hitting a church”. But again, it’s not so simple. She is Jewish and on the board of a synagogue. And over in Gadsden, Moore’s hometown, Chad Gowens, is a non-believer. “That’s usually a no-go in this part of the country,” the 33-year-old acknowledged. “People look at you like you have horns coming out of your head the moment you say you’re an atheist. They don’t have much to say to you.”
This state produced Wallace and Moore but it also produced Harper Lee, author of To Kill a Mockingbird, set in the fictional “tired old town” of Maycomb, Alabama. Barack Obama cited the classic novel in his farewell address as president earlier this year. “If our democracy is to work in this increasingly diverse nation, each one of us must try to heed the advice of one of the great characters in American fiction, Atticus Finch,” he said. “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view … until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.”"
Harvey Weinstein|The Observer|Sexual harassment|Film industry|Rape and sexual assault|Celebrity|news,2017-11-18T21:57:30,guardian,Mark Townsend,Producer hired team to investigate 91 film industry figures in attempt to stop harassment claims going public,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/18/harvey-weinstein-secret-hitlist-sex-scandal,Harvey Weinstein had secret hitlist of names to quash sex scandal,en,culture|film,,"The Observer has gained access to a secret hitlist of almost 100 prominent individuals targeted by Harvey Weinstein in an extraordinary attempt to discover what they knew about sexual misconduct claims against him and whether they were intending to go public.
The previously undisclosed list contains a total of 91 actors, publicists, producers, financiers and others working in the film industry, all of whom Weinstein allegedly identified as part of a strategy to prevent accusers from going public with sexual misconduct claims against him.
The names, apparently drawn up by Weinstein himself, were distributed to a team hired by the film producer to suppress claims that he had sexually harassed or assaulted numerous women.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest An extract from Harvey Weinstein’s hitlist.
The document was compiled in early 2017, around nine months before the storm that blew up on 5 October when the New York Times published a series of sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein.
Individuals named on the list were to be targeted by investigators who would covertly extract and accumulate information from those who might know of claims or who might come forward with allegations against the film producer. Feedback was then to be relayed to Weinstein and his lawyers.
The size of the list – 85 names appear on one document, with an addendum identifying another six individuals – appears to corroborate claims that sexual misconduct allegations against the 65-year-old were an open secret throughout Hollywood.
Prominent stars were among the first tranche of individuals on the list to testify publicly against Weinstein. Among those named were the actress Rose McGowan, who days after speaking out accused the producer of raping her. Another was Laura Madden, who told how Weinstein pestered her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London, beginning in 1991. McGowan and Madden were among the first to speak out against Weinstein last month.

A typed note on the document appears to suggest that by February 2016, Madden had already been targeted by one of Weinstein’s hired investigators. Her view of the producer is, says the note, “very bitter”.
Another name is Zelda Perkins, a London-based production assistant for Weinstein’s Miramax film company, who left the firm’s London offices on Brewer Street in Soho in 1998 after, she says, enduring years of sexual harassment by her boss. Last month Perkins revealed that she had broken a confidentiality agreement to describe alleged sexual harassment by the Hollywood producer.
Also on the list is the English actress Sophie Dix, who has described how her career trajectory was “massively cut down” after an alleged sexual assault by Weinstein in a London hotel and who was among the first to come forward.
Although at least 10 individuals are based in London, the majority live in New York, with others from Los Angeles. They include individuals working in acquisitions, marketing and distribution, along with producers, publicists and human resources staff, as well as actors. Forty-three men are named and 48 women.
Weinstein, the list confirms, was aware that the New York Times was gathering testimony from his victims long before it first ran the story. A public relations professional is named alongside a note stating that “HW [Harvey Weinstein] in contact w/him. Friends w/Jodi Kantor”. Kantor is the New York Times journalist who broke the story that immediately engulfed the producer and the film production company he co-founded with his brother.

More than 50 of the names have been coloured red to highlight those who should be prioritised by investigators – individuals Weinstein most keenly wanted to target. The names of the actresses McGowan, Dix and Madden are all coloured red.
Following an initial list of 85 names, another six individuals were identified during August 2017, including the actress Annabella Sciorra, who two months later publicly alleged she was raped by Weinstein after he barged into her apartment in the 1990s.
Also named on the later list is the US actress Katherine Kendall. Weeks later she revealed how a naked Weinstein “literally chased” her around his New York apartment in 1993.
Another is a former Weinstein employee, Lauren O’Connor, who documented several allegations against the producer in a 2015 memo in which she described a “toxic environment for women” at Miramax.
Interestingly, the document includes the filmmaker Brett Ratner, who has been accused of sexual harassment or misconduct by six women in the wake of the Weinstein allegations.

It is unclear whether Weinstein intended subsequently to approach any of the individuals on the list with a non-disclosure agreement. Evidence has emerged which shows that over the past three decades Weinstein reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on condition of anonymity, after he was confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact.
Not surprisingly, considering the psychological abuse and bullying allegations emerging from his former film studio Miramax, more of the film studio employees are also named. Among them is Kathy DeClesis, former assistant to Weinstein’s brother Bob, who has revealed that she told him about Harvey sexually harassing women over a period of 25 years.
So far, more than 50 women have come forward with allegations of rape, harassment and inappropriate behaviour, prompting police investigations in the US and UK.
Weinstein “unequivocally denies” all claims of non-consensual sex, a spokesman for the producer has said. The spokesman dismissed reports that the producer hired spies to stop claims, saying: “It is a fiction to suggest that any individuals were targeted or suppressed at any time.”
The producer’s alleged targets were often young, aspiring actresses. Among the high-profile names who have spoken out against Weinstein are Angelina Jolie, Cara Delevingne and Kate Beckinsale."
Bullying|Opinion|Transgender|Gender|comment,2017-11-19T00:03:45,guardian,Catherine Bennett,"Whether abuse is in the classroom, the media or the trans debate, it represses free speech",https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/bullies-everywhere-take-delight-in-coming-up-with-new-insults,Bullies everywhere delight in coming up with new insults,en,UK|society,,"Among the highlights of the just-concluded Anti-Bullying Week, a schools event since 2004, was the launch by Prince William of a taskforce on the prevention of cyberbullying and its first video – What to do in the event of a banter escalation scenario.
“Stop, speak, support”, is its advice to young people who witness online bullying, with an emphasis, as Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, explained, on encouraging their peers to seek help from a trusted adult, “because bullying doesn’t go away on its own”.
Still, for safety’s sake, it might be worth adding in parentheses, after, Stop, speak, “though not to the Daily Telegraph”. Last week, its trusted adults produced a front page that all but besought hostilities towards 15 “Brexit mutineers”. One, Anna Soubry, called it “blatant bullying”. In fact, any young people inspired by the taskforce to stamp out bullying in their own communities might want to study the speed with which the Telegraph’s escalation scenario got anonymous cyberbullies joining in the fun. “Stop, speak, support.”
After receiving threatening tweets, Soubry asked John Bercow, in his capacity as trusted adult, to stress the individual duty to “use language that brings our country together and makes sure that we have a democracy that welcomes free speech and an attitude of tolerance”.
Online, in what Monica Lewinsky, a bullying victim turned anti-bullying campaigner, describes as a “culture of humiliation”, Bercow’s powers are plainly limited. She, too, featured in anti-bullying week, publicising a campaign, #clickwithcompassion, and urging victims not to bully back.
“We should look,” she said, “at why someone [wants] to hurt and wield power over someone else.”
Maybe it helps if the bully is actively backed by trusted adults – at the Daily Telegraph, say, or the Daily Mail, which came up with the “Enemies of the People” front page: a clear message to three troublesome judges, one “openly gay”, about who’s in charge. As Lewinsky points out, organised online bullying shuts down debate, or confines participation to the most robust. “We will eventually – whether we realise it or not – start censoring ourselves,” she said last week. “We’ll think about how we are expressing our opinions through the lens of ‘will I be lambasted?’ That’s a very dangerous place for us to go as a society.”
If so, the potential damage doesn’t conspicuously trouble many of the trusted adults associated, on the left, with Corbyn’s “kinder politics”. Some prominent supporters of proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) have been wondering, for instance, whether, if there really are diminishing returns in writing off as a “terf” anyone who disagrees, there might not be a better slur. What’s mean enough to mute the nervous, without actually being hate speech? Feminazi? Too Daily Mail. Nasty woman? Also taken. Transmisogynist? A popular option, but it uses up so many characters.
Progressive head scratching as to what word might project the same corrective menace as terf (originally a small group’s chosen acronym, now applied at random), seems to have ended officially with this offering from my Guardian colleague, Owen Jones. “If,” he mused last week, “TERF’ [Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist] is unacceptable, let’s just use ‘transphobe’ and ‘transphobic’, problem solved.” Given that this guidance comes from the man who admirably closed down “chav” because it “demonised” the working classes, there seems every chance that “transphobe” will become the approved term for people who think, for instance, that there might be one or two arguments for preserving certain women-only spaces.

Yes, given the heightened imputation of backward irrationality to women who might question, say, the value attributed by the proposed legislation to cultural norms of gendered behaviour, transphobe could well be the more effective insult.
And given that phobic is probably more widely understood than “terf” – even on the left – as being shameful, it could well be a better means of muting anyone who wonders, for example, whether if more and more children find their bodies and gender to be mismatched, it could be worth trying to ask what and where they are learning about gender.
Where the advance of terf, as a bullying tool, has already succeeded in repressing speech – and maybe even research – “transphobe”, while being less snarl-friendly, has the advantage of implying that any child-related caution – about, say, lack of research on the longer term outcomes of early transition – could never be reasoned, only pathological. To many campaigners, even to dispute that would be tantamount to ignoring trans suicides, and therefore tantamount to transphobia.
True, different views on the surge in female-to-male transition were reported brilliantly last week by the Times’s Janice Turner, one of the strikingly few women willing, in the face of concerted abuse, publicly to examine complex social and medical changes the authorities seem disinclined to explore. That such women are frequently and correctly described as “brave”, for all the world as if they were war correspondents, only underlines the extent to which conventionally abhorrent exhibitions of bullying and hate-speech have been allowed to flourish here – with some of our most trusted adults leading by example.
When noted equalities campaigners endorse the use of “terf”, events such as the recent walkout of Labour officials in Bexhill and Battle, following allegedly uninhibited bullying of a women’s officer, Anne Ruzylo, must be the predictable consequence. “If we can’t talk about gender laws and get shut down on that,” says Ruzylo, “what’s next?”
Trans people already face a hostile world. Now the media is making it worse | Paris Lees Read more
One thing that followed was an online compliment to one of her alleged denigrators, saying he looked, compared with her, “the more feminine one”. Sometimes, irked pioneers of gender inclusiveness can recall, more than anything, the instincts of a David Davis when denied a hug: “I am not blind.”
Even if one agreed, which I don’t, that the expression of any doubts about the GRA instantly identifies the speaker as a member of what our mentors call the “doomed anti-trans lobby”, the degree to which this debate has legitimised intolerance, targeting and recently, the physical harassment of women surely indicates a responsibility, on the part of undeviatingly debate-averse progressives, to do more than offer synonyms.
At Speakers’ Corner, a woman was punched last month as she filmed women gathering for an event called “What is Gender?”. More recently, at the Anarchist Book Fair, Helen Steel was surrounded, she writes, by “around 30 trans activists who shouted misogynistic abuse in my face and at others, and who would not leave me alone. This included: ugly terf, fucking terf scum, bitch, fascist and more.”
To suggest that transphobe makes the more acceptable insult is like saying the Telegraph should have written slightly different words over its target practice; that the Daily Mail should have called its three pilloried judges something a wee bit nicer than enemies: the intent to bully remains.
“Stop, speak, support”, then. Though not if the banter has only escalated as far as transphobe. That’s just the progressive way of telling women to shut up."
Robert Mugabe|Opinion|Zimbabwe|Africa|comment,2017-11-19T00:05:46,guardian,Ranga Mberi,"Most of us have known no other leader, and now hope that this young nation can realise its potential",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/zimbabwe-is-not-the-banana-republic-of-western-fancy-after-mugabe-it-can-thrive,"Zimbabwe is not the banana republic of western fancy. After Mugabe, it can thrive",en,opinion,,"On Friday, an office worker at a government building took down President Mugabe’s portrait to dust it, as she has done every day for years. Then she paused, unsure whether to put it back up. The portrait is everywhere, from supermarkets, offices and banks. There he is – Mugabe, sitting stiffly in his dark suit, peering down through thick-rimmed glasses, as the stern father looking down at us.
Much like the portrait, Mugabe has been an ever-present influence in every Zimbabwean’s life. But yesterday, as strangers hugged and stopped to dance with each other when I made my way to an anti-Mugabe rally, it seemed that he was finally leaving, with Zimbabweans looking to the future with a mix of anxiety and hope.
Everyone has imagined what they would do the day Robert Mugabe goes. They have replayed it in their minds, over and over. They would go into the streets, sing and dance and honk their car horns. They would, over a beer, toast the end of a rule that has denied opportunity to an entire generation. But his end has not been that sudden. The last days of Mugabe have, instead, been something of a soap opera. Is this really how it is all going to end, we’ve asked each other over the last days.
Many of us have known no other leader. He was sold to us as the father of the nation. Our guardian. The one who led our struggle for independence and protected us from imperialists. Watching the reign of such a dominant figure end in such a farce is not what we imagined.
The military action against him was made in plain sight. Zimbabweans stared at their phones as incredible pictures of army vehicles rolling into Harare flew around social media. That Tuesday night, few slept. The army had taken over the state broadcaster, someone said. No. It was all fake news, we said. But then, in the early hours of Wednesday, two men in military uniform appeared on the screens. We are here just for the criminals around Mugabe, they said. This is not a coup.
For a full day, there were no further updates. We scrolled through the foreign news channels desperate to find out what was happening in our own country. In the vacuum, we did what we do best. We created memes online and joked away the anxiety. Soon we grew tired of the jokes. For years, state media had sold us the image of an invincible man. Now we watched, mouths agape, as the young ZBC presenter said the words we never thought we would hear on national television: “Zanu-PF has asked President Mugabe to step down.”
This was when we knew we had to start thinking of life without him. He has built for himself the image of a father figure who the country cannot do without. Many Zimbabweans had even come to see him as the country and now wonder what life will be without him.
In the western media, he has often been touted as the good leader who somehow turned bad midway, especially when he started taking over white-held land. Only after the land takeovers did the world start to see him as an ogre.
Zimbabweans know better. As Mugabe himself told an interviewer in 1981: “What I was, I still am.” In the 1980s, a military brigade that reported directly to Mugabe killed thousands of civilians in the south of the country. Through the 1990s, Mugabe expelled party officials who opposed his plan to establish a one-party state and make himself leader for life. Protests by unions were brutally crushed as the economy collapsed.

Now, a generation that has lived under no other leader must dare to hope. Zimbabwe is often portrayed as the standard African banana republic. We face-palm when we read distorted western portrayals of the country we live in; we side-eye the talking heads on CNN as they call us a failed state. Zimbabwe has suffered greatly, but we remain a young nation still bursting with unrealised potential. We are relieved, but cautious. The changes are a chance to start over, even though we are not quite sure what change exactly this is. Despite all the years of decline, Zimbabwe’s infrastructure – from roads to communications – is largely intact. Banks are without cash, but the financial sector is modern.
The population is young, well educated and desperate to use its idle skills. From the rolling hills in the east to the game parks in the west, Zimbabwe has some of the best tourist attractions in Africa. The country is rich with minerals, from gold to lithium, with demand for latter growing as it is used in rechargeable devices.
Yesterday morning, before Zimbabweans marched for Mugabe’s resignation, I went to the place where it all began for him. Stodart Hall is in Mbare, Harare’s oldest township. There is nothing here that suggests it is a place full of history. The light bulbs have been stolen and, at the entrance, there is a sign announcing the start times for the next prophetic healing service.
On Pazarangu Avenue, which runs past the hall, jobless youths sit on piles of bricks and prop their feet up on boxes to avoid the slime flowing from a broken sewerage pipe. Across the road, at what used to be a sports complex, a crew is preparing for a show, later that night, of Kinnah, a popular artist of the dancehall music that has become the refuge of many poor urban youths.
Nothing says that this was where Mugabe, almost 60 years ago, began his political career when a fiery speech he made sparked weeks of protest. Mugabe has come back to Stodart Hall frequently, but only to preside over the funerals of his dead war comrades. The hall is used for such occasions. At the National Heroes Acre, the burial place for heroes of the struggle, a sculpture of Mugabe stands fixed to a towering wall. Many who lie here sacrificed more, but it is Mugabe alone who stands immortalised in bronze, chest thrust forward, flag fluttering behind him.
On one visit, Kingston Kazambara, the curator, looked up at the massive piece of North Korean art, and gushed: “That’s none other than His Excellency, Comrade Robert Gabriel Mugabe, majestically, triumphantly, bravely guiding his flock forward to a new future.”
Now we must imagine a new future without him, and without the portraits of a big man looking down on our every move.

Michael Gove|Opinion|Strictly Come Dancing|comment,2017-11-19T00:04:46,guardian,Victoria Coren Mitchell,The environment secretary has shown a flash of his old character but I can’t forgive his betrayal,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/fell-out-of-love-michael-gove-betrayal,"Michael Gove, where did our love go?",en,opinion,,"Did you wake up on Thursday morning expecting to feel a wave of affection for Michael Gove? I didn’t. I’m not sure anyone did. Possibly not even Mrs Gove, who wrote a very interesting joke in her Daily Mail column the day before.
“Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein are reportedly languishing in rehab at an upmarket sex addiction clinic in Arizona,” it began. “No sex for eight weeks, apparently – although quite why they needed to fly to the desert for that is beyond me. Most of us find getting married does the trick.”
I’m intrigued by this joke. It suggests that getting married is quicker and easier than flying to Arizona from Los Angeles. Why bother flying to the desert when you could just get married? asks the joke. Falling in love, proposing, arranging a wedding, taking your vows, waiting for time to pass, letting the sex grow stale and then living out your life in companionable celibacy, would save you all the hassle and expense of that 57-minute aeroplane flight.
It also ignores the fact that Harvey Weinstein – self-confessed abuser and alleged rapist – is married already.
What a weird joke.
I know the joke doesn’t really tell us anything about Sarah Vine’s marriage. (That’s Mrs Gove; she kept her maiden name. As a result, pretty much every column for her first two years at the Mail had to include the phrase “My husband, the education secretary Michael Gove”, tucked into the text like a golden hare. It was fun looking for it, I used to think, as I read the papers with my husband, the comedian David Mitchell.)
Anyway, although the joke’s premise is peculiar, its suggestion of passionless married life is a standard one. We learn nothing about the Goves’ real sex life, though I did enjoy being openly invited to imagine it.
What I enjoyed even more was the front page of Thursday’s Times, which reported that Michael Gove is subtly “auditioning” to be the next chancellor.
Colleagues have revealed that, in cabinet meetings, the now environment secretary keeps turning the subject to economic matters, “including references to the obscure Markets In Financial Instruments Directive”.
This may just be a sign that he’s desperate to talk about anything other than the environment. But if colleagues think he’s angling for the exchequer, I defer to their better knowledge of the man. I want to think it’s true because (a) it’s hilarious and (b) it reminds me of a lost, happy, innocent time when I felt affectionate about Michael Gove.
I mean, it’s so geeky, so socially awkward. Turning the conversation to financial regulation because that’s what you’ve revised? It’s like men who read about claret before a posh dinner. (“Oh, rioja … I actually prefer claret, from the second-largest wine growing area in the world, and of course it was the national drink in medieval Scotland.”)
I don’t say this from a position of superiority. If I’m going to a social occasion that makes me nervous – in other words, a social occasion – I make lists of possible topics in advance.
When you hear that Gove is visibly shoving the chat round to financial matters, you may see the naked self-interest of an ambitious Brexiter with his eye on promotion. I see the vulnerability of a studious type trying to be smooth – and failing utterly.
That is the Old Gove. That’s the Gove who got to Oxford after an unlucky start in life, wrote columns and books, loved quizzes, won spelling contests; who truly seemed to care about social mobility and the fact that (as he once put it) “rich thick kids do better than poor clever children”.
We might not have been political twins, but I liked the cut of his jib. He seemed like an Only Connector. That was all Before.
Before he said: “The people of this country have had enough of experts.” Ow, the pain! The betrayal! It was the Clarkson card, the “Shakespeare is boring” card. From the secretary who said education should be about the three Rs, rote learning and exams!
When people don’t want experts, Michael, they want charisma, physical fitness and cool! Where does that leave you, Michael?! Me? Us? You were one of us! And then you sailed away, giving us the finger! You became the cynic, the anti-intellectual, the smasher of ancient icons. Bovver boots don’t suit weeds. This isn’t about politics, it’s about soul. What happened to yours?
So, I felt a wave of nostalgia as I pictured Michael Gove clumsily working his small talk round to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive.
And then I remembered: Britain is sick of experts.
Perhaps if Michael Gove wants to audition for chancellor, he should just smash up an abacus and shout: “I’ll never get my head round it!”
Because that’s all Britain wants, Michael, isn’t it?
Joking aside
Congratulations to Have I Got News For You on topping the complaints list (with 234 official grumbles, after their 3 November episode) in the first week that the BBC was forced to publish numbers.
I assume that brilliant production will know what an accolade this is, after 27 years of shaking things up. The fact that the massive and much younger Strictly Come Dancing came second, with 206 objections, shows complaints are just a measure of public interest.
I hosted the next episode of HIGNFY, on 10 November, and received a lot of complaints directly to my Twitter feed. It was a precise 50/50 split between those who thought I made too many jokes at Jeremy Corbyn’s expense (this being an “establishment show” on the Tory BBC) and those who thought I made too few jokes at Jeremy Corbyn’s expense (this being an “alternative comedy” show on the leftie BBC).
In a mood of nervous pitter-patter, a nation terrified to speak its mind for fear of giving offence to one side or another, I was proud to be part of it."
Budget 2017 (November)|Opinion|Philip Hammond|Brexit|comment,2017-11-19T00:04:45,guardian,Andrew Rawnsley,Hammond’s colleagues are setting him up to fail so that he can be blamed for all their problems and deficiencies,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/the-state-of-the-tory-party-is-the-only-grand-reveal-of-this-budget,The state of the Tory party is the only grand reveal of this budget,en,opinion,,"Budget day used to mean something. It was one of the big ceremonial occasions of British politics, second only to the Queen’s Speech as parliamentary theatre and very often much more significant in the hierarchy of importance. The event was vested with unique rituals and the contents of the chancellor’s briefcase were reverenced with elaborate secrecy until the grand reveal to expectant MPs.
Philip Hammond will go through the motions this Wednesday. His gaunt and gangling figure will brandish the red box from the steps of Number 11 before he heads down the road. The traditions will be honoured, but they will be performed by an encircled chancellor in straitened circumstances who knows that much of his own party are out to get him. A man who has spent the weeks running up to the event telling Tory MPs that there are no “magic bullets” in his armoury would probably prefer not to be delivering a budget at all right now.
Some of the shrinkage in the status of the occasion can be put down to its erosion by long-term forces. Globalisation deprived governments of the ability to pretend that they were supreme masters of their own economic universe. The shrivelling of public reverence for its rulers has also had its effect. Gordon Brown handed operational control of interest rates to the Bank of England because chancellors were no longer trusted not to seek partisan advantage by fiddling with the cost of borrowing. George Osborne set up the Office for Budget Responsibility to mark the Treasury’s homework because chancellors were no longer trusted not to duke the figures. All the same, mention of those two past holders of the office is a reminder that even in recent and challenging times budgets could pack a punch. A powerful chancellor such as a Brown or an Osborne would exploit the occasion to play a decisive role in setting the direction of government and nation by launching substantial and enduring reforms.
Many are the Tories whose unsolicited, pre-budget advice to Mr Hammond is to be “big and bold”. They urge him to seize the moment as a chance to vest this flailing government with a coherent and convincing purpose. They make that demand in the expectation not that their hopes will be fulfilled, but that they will be disappointed by the man and the measures. This chancellor was not supposed to be flattered when his officials gave him the nickname of “Box Office”. The friendliest things said by colleagues is that he is a technocrat who can add up and that he approaches the hazards to the economy posed by Brexit with a more grown-up attitude than some of his quarrelling companions in the cabinet. Flair and ingenuity are not words that come attached to this chancellor. Nor is he associated with a fingertip feel for the public mood or the sensitivities of his colleagues. His horizon is too narrow, his position is too precarious and the future is too clouded to meet the demand for him to be the agent of a rejuvenation of this government. He didn’t acquire his other nickname, “Spreadsheet Phil”, for nothing.
This makes it convenient for colleagues to blame their party’s problems on deficiencies in the chancellor’s political personality, but that is mainly displacement activity. Even were the Treasury occupied by a more visionary and inspirational figure, this budget would be constipated by the context in which it is delivered. The event is a meagre affair compared with Brexit, the eclipsing enterprise that looks more difficult than ever. The outcome of that perilous experiment will be many multiples more important for the future of the British economy than anything the chancellor does or does not do on Wednesday. He will say things about growth in the knowledge that the forecasts will be more than usually dodgy because of the swirl of Brexit-induced uncertainties. For any company pondering whether or not to pull investment and jobs from these shores, whatever the chancellor has to say about productivity will matter far less than where businesses will be left once Britain has departed the EU. And that he won’t be able to tell them.
The run-up to the budget has served one useful purpose. It has illustrated how collective sense and discipline have fragmented within the governing party. From different quarters, Conservative MPs clamour for more spending on this politically sensitive area and more cash for that personal enthusiasm. From other parts of Toryland, there is the demand to use any surplus funds for tax reductions. Tory MPs can glibly chorus that the chancellor should be “big and bold”. Saying that is a lot easier than managing to agree among themselves about what radicalism should amount to. The chancellor cannot possibly meet the combined weight of their competing expectations. Even if he were a political conjuror of the highest class, Mr Hammond could not magic up a budget that would satisfy so many contradictory demands. Bold usually means controversial and anything tricky will be a nightmare to negotiate through a parliament where the government lacks a reliable majority.

The prelude to this budget has also been accompanied by a further disintegration of cabinet cohesion. The prime minister was sent a “secret letter” by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove – a missive so “for your eyes only” that it swiftly found its way on to the front page of a newspaper with its barely disguised call for the prime minister to sack the chancellor for lacking their Brexit zealotry.
Before any budget, spending ministers have always made “submissions” to the Treasury. Bolder characters would occasionally make coded bids for extra funding for their areas of responsibility. What I don’t recall is ministers being so brazenly open about it. The old rules of “budget purdah”, which dictated that not a word about it was said in public before the event, have given way to a new anarchy of “budget souk”, in which its contents are publicly haggled over in advance.
Sajid Javid has made a weekly event of tabling his demands for more spending on housing. Jeremy Hunt has led a cabinet rebellion against the public sector pay cap and bid up anticipation of what he will secure for the NHS. I expect there will be more attention to housing in the budget, but the measures will not be radical enough to address a crisis that Mr Javid calls “unprecedented”. I am told there will be more for health, but it won’t be sufficiently generous to appease the government’s critics. The overall effect of all the Tory clamour around the budget has been to raise expectations that cannot be fulfilled, pre-ordaining that it will be regarded as a let-down by campaign groups and present an easier target for the opposition. This breakdown in the traditional budget disciplines has been encouraged by the weakness at the top of government. The prime minister does not have much strength in reserve to buttress her chancellor even if she wanted to. And she does not want to deploy whatever residual authority she might possess in support of a chancellor she does not believe in. Her former chief of staff and continuing confidant, Nick Timothy, pulled aside the curtain on the state of their relationship when he recently wrote: “Instead of being bold in seeking solutions, Philip Hammond’s instinct will always be to maintain existing policy, regardless of its quality. He lacks a burning desire to change people’s lives for the better, and imagination to see possibilities beyond how the world works today.”
The old rules of budget purdah, dictating that nothing be said in public, have given way to the anarchy of budget souk
The temperature gauge of the relationship between the neighbours in Downing Street fell to zero during the election when the prime minister locked her chancellor in a cupboard for the duration of the campaign. She did so because she planned to sack him afterwards He knows she wanted to sack him and would have done so had the voters not saved his bacon by depriving the prime minister of a parliamentary majority.
They wouldn’t, of course, be the first prime minister and chancellor to have a sour relationship. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had many titanic confrontations, but they were generally careful not to have too many of the rows in front of the children. The bad blood between the current unhappy partnership on Downing Street is an open secret in Whitehall and is reliably reported to have been made worse by endless wrangling about the contents of this budget.
When he gets to his feet on Wednesday, Philip Hammond will do so conscious that his most dangerous enemies will be sitting alongside and behind him. The hardline Tory Brexiters, they who disparage him as “Eeyore”, have been after him for months because he is the most influential advocate within the cabinet for a softer form of departure. They are deliberately setting high expectations of the budget that they know he cannot meet, the better to position themselves to demand his head when he does not deliver. A substantial number of Tory MPs, among them prominent members of the cabinet, are willing him to flop. They want the budget to be a disaster to give them an excuse to move against the chancellor. That tells you what you need to know about how bizarre the internal pathologies of the Conservative party have become. That is the big reveal of this budget."
Saudi Arabia|Opinion|Middle East and North Africa|Trump administration|Yemen|editorials,2017-11-19T00:05:46,guardian,Observer Editorial,"While Yemen starves, Trump moves ever close to its tormenter, the headstrong ruler of Saudi Arabia",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/the-observer-view-on-saudi-arabia-the-us-and-yemen,"The Observer view on Saudi Arabia, the US and Yemen",en,opinion|editorials,,"Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, is a young man in a hurry. So, too, is Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Together, they make a dangerous combination. By all accounts, the two men have become firm friends, forging a strong bond melding youth and power. Kushner, 36, made his third visit to Saudi Arabia this year at the end of October. He reportedly talked late into the night with Salman, 32, at the latter’s desert ranch.
Shortly after the meeting, three things happened: Salman began a sweeping purge of wealthy royal rivals; he launched a silent coup in Lebanon; and the Saudi armed forces imposed an aid blockade on Yemeni ports, which (though now partly eased) threatens a humanitarian catastrophe. The White House, supportive of its Saudi friends, made no criticism. Trump tweeted support for the purge. Thanks in part to Kushner, his first foreign trip was to Riyadh, where he was feted by the autocratic regime. He feels a connection.
The strong links between Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler, and the influential Kushner, Trump’s personal overseas troubleshooter and Middle East envoy, are nevertheless a big worry for American diplomats and the Pentagon. Officials told the New York Times they were not briefed on the Salman-Kushner talks. Such secretiveness is apparently the norm. “Jared is a bit of a black hole. There is no sense of the positions he has advocated. We can only guess, based on what he has done and where he has been,” an official said. “The Saudis have been very careful to cultivate him and bring him along.”
How the US under Trump runs its foreign policy is its own business. But when reckless, impulsive and confrontational actions, destabilising the world’s most volatile region, are the result, it’s a problem for everyone. That is what is happening now. As defence minister in 2015, Salman launched the military intervention in Yemen. Its aims were to defeat Shia Muslim Houthi rebels and reduce Iranian influence. It has failed miserably in both. What is has done is turn one of the world’s poorest countries into a killing ground, ravaged by violence, disease and malnutrition.
UN relief organisations warned last week that millions could perish. Save the Children said an estimated 130 Yemeni children are dying every day. More than 50,000 children are believed to have died this year alone – an horrific figure that, coming on the eve of World Children’s Day tomorrow, is deeply shaming.
As Clive Myrie’s graphic BBC television reports last week suggested, the disaster in Yemen is as unacceptable as it is avoidable. But Saudi actions, including alleged crimes against humanity, pass unchallenged by Kushner and a collusional Trump administration.
Visceral Saudi fear of its great regional rival, Iran, lies at the heart of Salman’s many foreign policy miscalculations and mistakes – the cause of growing alarm among western allies, oil buyers and arms suppliers. A furious row has erupted with Germany over Riyadh’s alleged role in forcing the resignation of Lebanon’s prime minister, Sa’ad Hariri, over his refusal to crack down on Iran-backed Hezbollah. Hariri, who his supporters claim was kidnapped by the Saudis, has now taken refuge in Paris.
Circumventing the White House’s silence on Lebanon, Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, warned last week the country must not become “a venue for proxy conflicts”. His implied criticism of Riyadh as well as Tehran was significant. France and Germany, mindful of the blockade against Qatar that Salman imposed earlier this year over its links to Tehran, have expressed similar concerns about a widening arc of instability. As Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s foreign minister, reportedly put it: “Another troublespot is the last thing people in the Middle East need now.”
Salman’s campaign of attrition in Yemen even provoked a mild rebuke from Britain’s foreign office last week, which called for “immediate access for commercial and humanitarian supplies”. This was unusual, given the British government’s habitual subservience to Riyadh. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, may have ulterior motives. He is in deep trouble over his mishandling of the case of the wrongly imprisoned British-Iranian woman, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Johnson is due to visit Tehran soon. Perhaps he hopes to curry favour before he arrives.
The sclerotic House of Saud has been viewed historically in the west as a necessary if unattractive force for stability in the Middle East. The biggest criticisms concerned its undemocratic governance, its appalling record on human and civil rights and the ultra-conservative nature of the regime, notably its role in the propagation of Sunni fundamentalism and jihadist ideology. But Salman’s Saudi is increasingly viewed in quite a different light: as an unpredictable, dangerous loose cannon proficient at starting or fuelling conflicts it cannot finish. Its many failings now look less tolerable.
Saudi Arabia is under pressure not just from Iran’s ambitions but also from falling oil revenues, shrinking national wealth and mounting demands for reform. Big changes are undoubtedly required – and in train. Salman’s foolish, headstrong behaviour, sanctioned by his unaccountable pal in the White House, risks it all."
Budget 2017 (November)|Opinion|Philip Hammond|George Osborne|Theresa May|Tax and spending|Universal credit|editorials,2017-11-19T00:03:45,guardian,,The chancellor must finally banish the ghost of George Osborne and help the poor,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/hammond-november-budget-banish-ghost-osborne-help-the-poor,The Observer view on Philip Hammond’s budget,en,UK,,"At every opportunity, Theresa May has emphasised how much she wants her premiership to represent a break from the pre-Brexit past. From her first public words as prime minister on the steps of Downing Street, to her speech on housing last Thursday, she has consistently articulated that she will govern in the interests of ordinary working people. We are to believe that she does not just want to deliver Brexit, she wants to address the economic and cultural factors that helped bring it about.
But May has turned down every opportunity to make things better. The deindustrialisation and loss of employment and identity that helped foment the conditions for Brexit are decades old.
Their effects have been worsened since the financial crisis by the economic policies of David Cameron’s government. And since May has become prime minister, we have had an autumn statement and a spring budget that have barely deviated from George Osborne’s spending plans.
May did not change course back when she was in a position of relative strength and authority before June’s general election; it seems even less likely now. So 16 months after he left No 11, Osborne’s stamp will in all likelihood remain heavily imprinted on Wednesday’s budget.
It is to the nation’s detriment. Osborne’s signature approach was one of badging flashy initiatives – a higher minimum wage; more cash than ever for the NHS; help to buy for those struggling to get on the housing ladder – as symbols of a Conservative government committed to ensuring that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden of austerity.
But underneath the disingenuous PR lay a much sharper reality. An NHS facing its tightest-ever financial settlement, with a big chunk of its cash increase coming from cuts to health training budgets. A housing scheme that helped a handful of the most affluent renters over the line into home ownership, while inflating prices and taking it further out of reach for everyone else. And, most perniciously, modest increases in the minimum wage, whose benefits for low-income families with children were far outweighed by the cuts to tax credits and benefits that Osborne set in train.
Hammond has made no mark of his own: he has simply continued down the path sketched out by Osborne. He might argue that he has no headroom to soften the blow. But even on the chancellor’s own terms, that’s a deceit. There is a robust case for borrowing to invest in housing, infrastructure and public services when the economy is so sluggish and interest rates so low. But even within Hammond’s own fiscal rules, choices exist. He has chosen to follow Osborne in opting for cutting support for poor families with children and the disabled, using it to pay for further income tax cuts that benefit the more affluent.
The results are staggeringly unjust. Low-income families and disabled people stand to lose eye-watering sums: the poorest fifth of working-age families with children will be more than £3,000 a year worse off on average by 2020 as a result of tax and benefit changes. In sharp contrast, some of the most affluent families with children will find themselves £500 a year better off.
These are parents often trapped in low-paid work, struggling to make ends meet, who simply cannot afford to lose thousands of pounds a year. The consequences are already in evidence: families who can’t afford to eat pushed to seeking out food banks; people getting into spiralling debt; individuals who can no longer afford their rent finding themselves living on the streets. This is a government that pretends to have the interests of the struggling at heart.
Yet on its watch, child poverty is forecast to reach its highest level since modern records began: almost one in four children will be growing up in poverty by 2022. This, in one of the world’s richest countries.
Hammond’s top priority must be to cushion the blow on low-income families. Conservative chancellors will have delivered £80bn of tax cuts by 2020, including £22bn of income tax cuts and £13bn of corporation tax cuts.
He must go beyond cutting the six-week wait for new claimants of universal credit, which by itself would be far too incremental: he must halt further tax cuts and use the proceeds to restore the generosity of benefits to their old levels.

Cuts to public services are also wearing away at the fabric of the state in a way that hits the poorest families hardest. The NHS is so stretched that operations are getting arbitrarily rationed using criteria such as obesity and smoking, disproportionately affecting the less affluent. Further education budgets have been slashed, while higher education, still too much the preserve of the middle classes, has enjoyed healthy funding increases. The poorest areas have been most hit by police cuts and cuts to local council budgets.
There are two knock-on effects of the government making the poorest even poorer. First, it makes the regional inequality that contributed to the Brexit vote even worse. There is more to come: the government is insisting that councils become more reliant than ever on local tax revenues.
But it is more affluent areas with the biggest tax bases who will be able to spend more on their infrastructure and public services, attracting further business investment. This will catalyse even bigger gaps in prosperity between different parts of the country.
Second, the gap between the generations is getting bigger. From the young people locked out of home ownership, to new parents stuck in low-paid jobs, to the current generation of children that will be scarred by child poverty: the young are suffering the most.
Hammond must once and for all address the housing affordability crisis on Wednesday, scrapping the expensive price-inflating subsidies for first-time buyers, instead investing radically larger sums in house building, and improving the security of tenure for those who are renting.
The economy is also suffering from long-term structural problems that will make it even more vulnerable to the sharp economic shock of Brexit when it happens.
Productivity and investment remain far too low, resulting in sluggish growth that remains heavily reliant on consumer debt and rising house prices. There is a large number of low-paid, low-skill jobs in the service sector offering poor progression prospects, which necessitate significant government spending on in-work benefits.
Conservative chancellors have done far too little to address these issues since the financial crisis. Ten years on, they have got worse.
The country is in desperate need of a budget that parts ways with the spirit of Hammond’s predecessor. If the chancellor insists on stubbornly sticking to the course already plotted, Britain will become a meaner, more unequal society in which to live in the next decade. There is too much at stake. Hammond must once and for all banish the ghost of George Osborne that still haunts the Treasury."
Leonardo da Vinci|Opinion|Art|Damien Hirst|Painting|comment,2017-11-19T00:05:46,guardian,Tiffany Jenkins,"When a mediocre Leonardo breaks all records, it’s confirmation that today’s buyers have no eye for the art itself",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/leonardo-billionaires-taste-wealth,Great collectors used to have great taste. Now they simply show off their wealth,en,opinion,,"If you walk around Mayfair or Manhattan at twilight and look up, you could glimpse a Damien Hirst spot painting through an apartment window. The simple circles of colour on a grid and a white background are recognisable and everywhere. There are more than 1,000 in existence, and they have been exhibited all over the world.
The spot paintings are visually inoffensive; if one catches your eye, it does not hold it. One works as well hung in the living room as it does in the boardroom. But whichever wall it does grace, even a child knows it’s a Hirst, though painted by his assistants, even if they can’t differentiate one work from another.
That is the state of modern-day art collecting: safe, boring and expensive. According to a recent UBS/PricewaterhouseCoopers report, the world’s billionaires have seen their net worth climb by more than $900bn in the past year, collectively topping $6tn.
What's inside Ivanka Trump's male-dominated $25m art collection? Read more
There is a new rich class swimming in liquidity that can afford art with a high price-tag, which serves as both an asset, if an unreliable one, and a display of status. Chinese, Russian and Ukrainian billionaires have entered the market. Hedge fund managers trail behind them. A pricey artwork is just what you need after remodelling your billion-pound home: you splash your cash to display your wealth, if not your taste.
All of this goes some way to explain the astonishing price tag of Salvator Mundi, the most expensive painting ever sold at auction. The 500-year-old painting of Christ is thought to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci. It sold for a record $450m (£341m) in Christie’s auction rooms in New York last Wednesday evening. The identity of the buyer has not been revealed.
Though Leonardo da Vinci was a masterful artist, Salvator Mundi is not a great work of art. Christ faces the viewer in a conventional composition, with one hand raised, the other holding a glass sphere. His eyes are blank; his hair is limp. Cleaned and repainted so often, and layered in varnish, there is little left of what was original. It probably was by Leonardo, but not many of the brushstrokes can be his. He used assistants a lot at the time it was painted, and now much of it is reconstruction.

The inflated price was the result of a brilliant marketing campaign. The auction house conjured up a spectacle of smoke and mirrors. They named the work the “male Mona Lisa”. Pre-sale viewings in London, New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong drew 27,000 people. They commissioned a video – entitled The Last da Vinci: The World is Watching – more visually pleasing and dramatic than the painting, chronicling the emotional response of viewers. The buyer purchased a celebrity, something famous.
Critics of the sale have trotted out the usual complaint, that the incredible amount of money could have been spent on hospitals and playgrounds. But I’d argue that there is nothing wrong with spending this much on art per se, just on this piece. More shocking than the price tag is that great works of art are available for a fraction of the Leonardo, but few collectors are interested.
The most telling move is that Salvator Mundi was sold in the auction houses’ post-war and contemporary sale, rather than in an Old Masters sale, where you expect to find paintings from the period between the 13th and 18th century. The Leonardo, thought to have been painted in early 1500, sat alongside the currently hot Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol, from the 1980s and 1960s respectively, though the jaded may joke that much of the paint on the Leonardo is so recent that it qualifies.
In a few weeks’ time, there will be other far more worthwhile sales, but no bidding billionaires will be in attendance. The new money usually only sits in the auction room when something 20th century turns up. They leave when the old stuff arrives. Yet what is on offer at the December Old Masters sales at Christie’s and Sotheby’s, including one of Joseph Wright of Derby’s best-known works, An Academy by Lamplight, is breathtaking and, in context, extraordinarily cheap.
One of the first paintings listed, The Betrayal of Christ from the School of the Lower Rhine (circa 1510-15) is projected to go for £200,000 – £300,000. A late portrait by Titian should fetch £1m to £1.5m. Here you can get a decent Old Master, something museum-worthy, for a fraction of the cost of an unremarkable house in London.

What’s concerning is that in the past these would have been snapped up by collectors who were keen to demonstrate not only their status and wealth – vanities that have always driven the art market – but their erudition and social conscience. I’m thinking of the likes of the Anglo-Austrian art collector and art historian, Count Antoine Seilern, an old-school collector, one driven by scholarship, who devoted himself to the study of art history. He enrolled at the University of Vienna to study art history, and the subject of his doctoral dissertation was the Venetian influences on the ceiling paintings of Peter Paul Rubens. So loved was his collection of oil paintings that he rarely opened the blinds to his home in London’s South Kensington, where he lived after the second world war, to protect them; he largely refused to turn on the lights because he said it distorted the colours.
Seilern was one of a coterie of rich collectors who tried to buy great and important pictures, rather than, as now, chasing what was obvious. The men, and they were often men, did their own research, took risks, and bought what was unknown, unrecognised, and unfashionable. Among them was the American art historian Bernard Berenson, who worked for Joseph Duveen, a key dealer who bought art from European aristocrats and sold it to rising US robber barons in search of status. Duveen famously attributed his success to noticing that “Europe has a great deal of art, and America has a great deal of money”.
The public benefited from those connoisseur collectors in a way that it doesn’t from modern-day ignorant billionaires. They shaped taste and furnished great museums and galleries with tremendous art work: Duveen helped build the great collections of Mellon and Kress, now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington; he funded the Duveen Gallery in the British Museum designed to house the Parthenon sculptures. Even Seilern’s paintings eventually came down from his darkened walls and were hung in broad daylight as the bulk of his collection was bequeathed to the Courtauld Institute of Art. Go there to see a true masterpiece.

John Lewis Christmas ad|Opinion|Illustration|Children and teenagers|comment,2017-11-19T00:04:46,guardian,Chris Riddell,Advertising agencies should credit the illustrators and writers whose work they plunder,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/moz-monster-john-lewis-xmas-advert-illustration,John Lewis’s Moz was under my bed years ago - but they haven't credited me,en,opinion,,"It was the eyebrows that mesmerised me. They were luxuriantly bushy and rose and fell in an endlessly expressive way. I’m not talking about Moz the Monster, the star of the John Lewis Christmas advert I watched with the rest of the nation this week. No, the eyebrows in question belonged to the publisher Klaus Flugge of Andersen Press. It was 1984 and I was a young art school graduate doing the rounds of the publishing houses, showing my illustrations in the hope of a commission. Flugge raised then lowered those eyebrows and fixed me with a penetrating stare. “These illustrations are perfectly fine,” he said, a little too dismissively for my liking, but I was still mesmerised, “but where are your stories?” I wanted to be an illustrator, not a writer. I had no stories, so I played for time. “I do have a story,” I said falteringly, “but it’s at home.” “Bring in this story of yours tomorrow!” he ordered, his eyebrows furrowed, “I want to read it.”
So I went home and, in a blind panic, dredged up a memory from my childhood, common to many, of being convinced that there was something scary lurking beneath my bed. I wrote a reassuring story about a benign cuddly monster and took it in to Andersen Press. “This is perfectly fine,” said Flugge. “We will publish it.”
Mr Underbed became my first picture book, published in 1986 and reissued with new illustrations in 2009. Then I met Moz the monster this week. Just like Mr Underbed, Moz is big, hairy and blue and lives under a little boy’s bed, which he shakes and shudders when he emerges, snores loudly enough to require the boy to wear earmuffs and deprives him of sleep. The similarities are striking, so I posted a thank you to John Lewis on social media for devoting their Christmas advertising campaign to promoting my picture book.

The response has been overwhelming. My fellow children’s book illustrators and writers have been outraged on my behalf, for which I heartily thank them. Talk of legal action has flooded my Facebook feeds, but I won’t be pursuing that. Instead, I hope that advertising agencies and the big companies they work for, take care to credit creative people whose work they might reference. We have the finest children’s book writers and illustrators in the world – their work should be cherished and credited properly.
Next year? How about a John Lewis advert, set in a school library where children are encouraged to read for pleasure by a trained librarian – with beautiful taste in furniture and a stylish cashmere cardigan?

Now he has become the latest US actor to light up British theatre
The American actor Bryan Cranston received rave reviews last week for his performance at the National Theatre in Network, the stage adaptation of the Oscar-winning film from 1976 that starred Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway. Just as American film and television can’t seem to get enough of British theatre-trained actors, so we return the favour, with no one lighting up the London stage quite as much as an American screen star.
Although most of his acting career has been spent in either obscurity or overlooked supporting roles, and although he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Lyndon B Johnson in Robert Schenkkan’s All the Way, Cranston is indeed a screen star – thanks to his celebrated role as Walter White, the chemistry teacher-turned-drug lord, in the cable hit Breaking Bad.
He has the Breaking Bad logo tattooed on his ring finger to remind him, as he’s said, that “any opportunities I have now are because of that show”. Network is the latest of those opportunities and it’s a smart piece of casting. Cranston showed in Breaking Bad that he is a master of transformation, moving, as the show’s creator Vince Gilligan memorably put it, “from Mr Chips to Scarface”.
Profile The Bryan Cranston file Show Hide Born Bryan Lee Cranston on 7 March 1956 in Hollywood, California, the son of Audrey Peggy Sell, a radio actress, and Joseph Cranston, an amateur boxer and actor.

Worst of times The break-up of his family when he was a young child, the anger from which, he says, he channels into his acting. What he says “Even the meekest person in the room can become dangerous, if they’re desperate.” “Luck, luck, luck. You have to be a good actor, a good musician. But you also have to be ready for luck.” What others say “I used to tell him he’d be as good as a kindergarten teacher as he would be as the president of the United States. He has a skill set that is so vast, I’ve never known anyone else who was so good at so many things.” – Jane Kaczmarek, his co-star in Malcolm in the Middle.

The transformation of Howard Beale, the news anchor in Network, is speedier but no less dramatic. One moment he’s a reliable veteran of TV news, the next he’s having a breakdown during a live broadcast, threatening to kill himself and then becoming a kind of crazed celebrity guru.
The original film, written by Paddy Chayefsky, was a satire – in many respects a prescient one – on the commercialisation of news and the mindless malleability of the viewing masses. Although a great film in many ways, it was overburdened with speechifying of the kind more often seen on stage than in cinema.
So a theatrical adaptation makes more sense in this case than in others, even if the advent of Fox News, fake news, a former reality TV star as president and seemingly weekly mass shootings by notoriety-hungry lunatics has rendered its message a little out of date in America.
But another reason why Cranston makes sense in the part is that, just as Beale becomes an unlikely star, Cranston knows what it’s like to encounter unexpected fame.
He’s justly praised for his acting skills today, but they were far from universally recognised when, for example, he was appearing in adverts for haemorrhoid cream in the 1980s. Even when he managed to secure a more high-profile gig with the part of the father in the comedy series Malcolm in the Middle, he wasn’t by any stretch a name.
And with a name like Bryan Cranston, almost a platonic ideal of forgettable, you really do have to stand out for anyone to remember it.

Still, in Malcolm and in Cranston’s occasional appearances on Seinfeld as Dr Tim Whatley, “dentist to the stars”, the interested observer could tell that he had a gift for anxious comedy. There was a restless, frustrated quality that he brought to his parts, something of a ticking bomb that would eventually explode with Breaking Bad.
It was Jane Kaczmarek, his screen wife on Malcolm, who noticed the actor Cranston most resembled in style. “He always reminded me of Jack Lemmon,” she said, noting that he was very funny but also “the real thing dramatically”.
Certainly, there was a lot more going in his work than the nice guy everyman roles his pleasant, but unremarkable, looks tended to attract. That note of underlying angst that he shared with Lemmon could, without need of a psychology PhD, be traced to the destabilising experiences of his childhood.
He grew up in the San Fernando Valley, the huge, rather bland suburb that lies beyond the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. His father, a boxer and failed actor, quit the family home when Cranston was 11, completely disappearing for a decade.
As he recounts in his autobiography, A Life in Parts, his mother then took to drink, the house was repossessed and the young Cranston and his brother were sent to live with their grandparents on a poultry farm in the middle of nowhere, while his sister and mother lived with another grandparent. All this, he said, left him with “a reservoir of anger and resentment and abandonment issues”.
He’s spent a good deal of time in therapy, and still occasionally visits a couples therapist with his wife of 28 years, Robin Dearden. “Our agreement is, if either of us feels like we want to go, the other can’t object,” he told one interviewer.
As a teenager, he harboured ambitions of becoming a detective, and joined a police explorer group, a programme that gives youngsters a chance to explore a career in law enforcement. But he caught the acting bug when, during a delay in a road trip with his brother, he read Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler and came to a realisation. “The idea was to do something I love and become good at, rather than something I was good at and hoped to love.”
He’s said many times since his late fame arrived that he only ever wished to make a living out of acting, that he was perfectly content with being a successfully employed character actor operating under the celebrity radar. It may even be true, but why get a tattoo to remind you of your lucky break if you’re content for the spotlight to be occupied by your peers? After all, in Los Angeles, actors who are unbothered by their middling status in the industry are as rare as snow.
Perhaps he was closer to the reality when he told me during an interview for this newspaper: “In order to be an actor, you really have to be one of those types of people who are risk-takers and have what is considered an actor’s arrogance … the type of person who wants the ball with seconds left in the game. The masses don’t want the ball. They don’t want to be responsible for not making the shot. Actors need to want that chance. Give me that chance.”

Vince Gilligan, who’d written an X-Files in which Cranston played a paranoid antisemite back in 1998, offered the actor that chance 10 years later, with his drama about a frustrated teacher diagnosed with terminal cancer who launches a new career as a producer of crystal meth.
Cranston has not looked back since, except with a hint of regret. He says that fame has changed him, and he’s not sure if it’s for the better. He has “a tendency to hide away” nowadays, he says, often having to settle for socialising with other famous actors such as Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro. These are people, he explains in his book, who don’t need anything from him or vice versa. “We can relax in each other’s company.”
Relax, of course, is not the word one associates with Howard Beale. His most famous line is “I’m as mad as hell and I’m not going to take this any more,” which probably understates his fury. Finch’s performance was so feverishly manic that it may have shortened his life – he died of a heart attack while promoting the film, and won a posthumous Oscar.
Cranston’s is arguably a more nuanced interpretation, and unquestionably less ranty in delivery. The play is directed by Ivo van Hove, the ultra-cool Belgian director who wowed critics with his productions of A View From a Bridge and The Crucible.
Van Hove has said that Cranston has the “perfect look” of a news anchorman. “That was immediately clear that he was the perfect man. I think I can perhaps totally misdirect the whole thing, but Bryan cannot do anything wrong. It feels that it’s so natural to him.”
One obvious point that Network makes is that fame authorises opinion, and Cranston is no stranger to that process. It’s unlikely anyone sought his view on politics, for example, when he was doing daytime turns on Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
But, leading up to the last presidential election, he vowed to move to Canada if Donald Trump won. A few weeks ago, with Trump in the White House and Cranston still living in Ventura County, he said that to people who hope Trump fails, he has a message: “Fuck you. Why would you want that? So you can be right?”
Beale, you feel, would be proud of both opinions and in particular the language of their expression. Having found late middle-aged stardom, wealth and acclaim, Bryan Cranston, it seems, is as mad as hell and he’s not going to take it any more."
Parents and parenting|Opinion|Children|Family|Social media|Digital media|Jamie Oliver|comment,2017-11-19T00:05:46,guardian,Barbara Ellen,"Jamie Oliver has banned his daughter from posting ‘porno’ selfies, but kids will be kids",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/jamie-olivier-ban-teenage-selfies-social-media,Teenagers will always find ways to outwit parents,en,lifestyle|family,,"I’ve got time for Jamie Oliver – at least he tries to stand up for more than his own-branded crockery. This week, the father of five was commenting on teenagers posting provocative selfies online. He’s banned his 14-year-old daughter Daisy from posting selfies, and says that some of the photos he’s seen of other girls are “quite porno, luscious, pouty, pushing boobs out”. Oliver notes that this is the first parental generation to deal with social media, and wonders: why are the girls allowed to do it? Oliver says: “I’m like: Really? Aren’t their parents all over that like a rash?”
Well, I have news for Oliver – it’s quite probable that parents aren’t “letting them do it”. And it’s almost certain that they’re not looking at their daughters’ “porno” photos, saying: “You look great there, licking your lips suggestively in that tight top – why don’t you put it on Instagram?”
The point being that parents either don’t realise that their children are doing it (or at least the extent of it), or they do realise, but they also twig that there no way of stopping it altogether, short of confiscating all phones and tablets, and locking the children in a padded cell between the ages of 11 and 19. And, believe me, there may be times when that latter option doesn’t seem completely out of the question. Many a battleworn parent of a teenager has travelled the trajectory from “Fly, my child, fly fearless and free”, to a version of “Off to the tower, Rapunzel, and, if you let down your hair, all Netflix rights will be suspended.”
What sometimes seems to be going on is self-willed parental myopia – an often-unconscious reluctance to realise that, while there are always exceptions, their kids are most probably up to everything their friends are up to, or a version of it – either some, or all of the time, either right in front of their faces, or sneaking around behind their backs. It’s part of the Secret World of Teenage, and in that designated age-restricted zone, operating within their own circles, it’s usually (not always, but usually) harmless and short-lived enough. And, of course, it’s not “porno”. They’re playing – testing boundaries, experimenting with their image – which has always gone on to an extent.
While most parents wouldn’t have taken selfies in their youth, let’s be honest, it’s only because we didn’t think of it. Personally, I did a fair bit of prancing about in front of other people’s cameras, and, from the looks of it, my self-obsession was in rude health, with rude the operative word – in some photos, the look I appear to be going for is Trafficked Goth.
While it’s a bit excruciating, it’s also screamingly funny. However – and this is the generational dividing line – back in my day, my cringeworthy cavorting was kept more or less private. As Oliver points out, there’s now social media to deal with. Photos have the potential to drop a cluster bomb of far-reaching consequences – ranging from the degradation of revenge porn, problems with future employers, to young kids just not registering that, quite often, it’s not just their target peer group that can see the images.
So, Oliver is right, there’s plenty to worry about – in terms of short-term behaviour and long-term consequences. As any half-bright celebrity could tell you, the thing they miss the most is their anonymity. Many young people are losing this great privilege, tossing it away for a few “likes”, at a time when they’re too heartbreakingly young to realise the full implications.
Even sadder, there’s no stopping it. Tech-wise at least, most kids would be far savvier than their parents. Too often, this isn’t about parents “letting them do it”, or failing to stop it – if certain kids want to do it, the truth is they will usually find a way."

It can get quite parky up Yorkshire way, so it’s good that they’re preparing early for the snow and ice to come. The winning names would join a fleet of gritters with names such as Gritney Spears, Brad Grit, and Usain Salt. The only proviso was that people kept it clean and steered clear of the perhaps inevitable Gritty McGritFace, or, less obviously, and certainly less pleasantly, Gary Gritter.
The field looked open throughout, with zingers such as Spready Mercury and Basil Salty – even US singer Curtis Stigers pitched in with Grit Balls of Fire. However, the worthy winners were David Plowie and Gritsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Anti-Slip Machinery. While Gritsy Bitsy had to duke it out with Spready Mercury, I was always rooting for David Plowie. Not only because of Bowie’s festive connection with The Snowman – I could just visualise David Plowie scattering fragments of sedimentary rock (’n’ roll) on the icy pavements on behalf of the good folk of Doncaster.
By now, perhaps some people are getting weary of these periodic naming fests, but, as your correspondent, Barbie McBarbFace, I’m still loving it. The naming is great fun, but what I really enjoy is the mass outbreak of what I presume to be work-based skiving. At least I like to imagine that most of the people voting so enthusiastically were bored at work, say, in offices and call centres, tipping back their chairs, chewing pen tops, putting their brains to great seasonal use, dreaming up what were actually pretty decent snow, grit, and salt puns.
Well done, Doncaster council, and everyone who voted. This was truly the best of Britain in action, or, should I say, in inaction. It’s enough to make you come over all patriotic."

Some might say that it’s odd to give animals medals (so they can brag about their heroics to their military dog mates down the boozer?), but there’s something to be said for it.
While I don’t like the idea of animals being put in harm’s way, at least this highlights just how important they are to the military, as they are to others, such as the police – playing key roles and saving lives.
In a wider way, it’s just special to see an animal being shown such deep respect, which isn’t always the case. So, well done, Mali, and let’s hope that they chucked a bone in, too."

Europe’s largest lender, HSBC, is imposing a hiring and pay freeze across the bank globally in 2016, two sources told Reuters.
An email was sent to staff on Friday detailing the latest cost-saving measures, according to the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
HSBC suffers online banking cyber-attack Read more
Like numerous other global banks, HSBC is in the midst of a cost-cutting drive to boost profitability and returns to shareholders, and is pushing through with plans for annual cost savings of up to $5bn (£3.5bn) by 2017.
Europe’s biggest bank said in June that it planned to slash nearly one in five jobs and shrink its investment bank by a third in response to sluggish economic growth and tighter global regulation of bank balance sheet risk.
“As flagged in our investor update we have targeted significant cost reductions by the end of 2017,” a spokeswoman for HSBC told Reuters, confirming the content of the staff email.
In October, contractors at its investment banking division in London had their pay cut by 10% in line with the bank’s efforts to rein in costs, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time.
News of the pay and hiring freeze follows a significant week for HSBC, after its board met last week to consider moving its headquarters to Hong Kong and to focus on the bank’s strategy.
A decision on the domicile issue could come early next week, a senior source at the bank told Reuters on 27 January."

Productivity, often measured as the amount produced for every hour worked, has grown only slowly since the financial crisis, placing Britain even further behind its peers.
The gap prompted the business secretary, Sajid Javid, to declare last year that “boosting productivity is the economic challenge of our age”. The government launched a productivity plan in July 2015.
But in a report on Monday the Commons business, innovation and skills committee questions whether the plan is worthy of its name and urges the government to be bolder.
How to boost British productivity and save the NHS all at once Read more
The report is being published after the committee heard from big businesses that “not one of them had been consulted on the content of the productivity plan before its publication”. Another of its key criticisms is a lack of targets. “We question whether the document has sufficient focus and clear, measurable objectives to be called a ‘plan’,” the report says.
The committee’s chair, Labour MP Iain Wright, said that as it stands the plan risks “collecting dust on Whitehall bookshelves”.
“In recent years other countries have stormed ahead with productivity gains and we need to catch up,” said Wright. “As a committee we welcome the government’s focus on tackling this crucial issue for the UK economy. However, rather than being a clear and distinctive roadmap as to how Britain will close our productivity gap, the productivity plan is a vague collection of existing policies.”
On the latest figures output per hour from UK workers was 20 percentage points below the average of other leading industrialised nations. Economists say that the size of the economy and living standards would be significantly higher had pre-crisis growth rates for productivity been maintained.
Britain’s failure to boost productivity since the downturn, known as the “productivity puzzle”, has also been a focus for the Bank of England as it seeks to work out how much businesses can raise output without piling up inflationary pressures.
Financial markets are keenly awaiting the Bank’s outlook for inflation and economic growth published on Thursday amid turmoil on financial markets and signs of a slowdown in the UK and other big economies.
A business survey published on Monday contains fresh signs that the gloomy global backdrop is knocking confidence among UK companies.
Alongside a drop in confidence there was an increase in the number of firms operating below capacity over the last three months, indicating a further deterioration in productivity, as measured by the poll from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales with accountants Grant Thornton.
UK economic growth slows in 2015: what the economists are saying Read more
The survey of 1,000 chartered accountants found that while exports were currently “very weak” they were expected to improve thanks to a strengthening eurozone and a weaker exchange rate with the euro.
After official data last week showed GDP growth edged up to 0.5% in the final quarter of 2015 from 0.4% in the third quarter, the ICAEW predicts growth will slip back again this quarter. “The decline in confidence points to only modest growth in GDP in the first quarter of 2016, at 0.4%,” it said.
The gloomy outlook could cause headaches for chancellor George Osborne ahead of his mid-March budget, said ICAEW chief executive Michael Izza.
“Growth is expected to slow and will mean less income into the Treasury. If that happens, the chancellor simply won’t meet his deficit reduction target. It will become a three-parliament problem,” said Izza.
“After a particularly bullish autumn statement, the chancellor has had to row back on the immediate prospects for the UK economy. This presents new challenges for him and how he responds in next month’s budget.”

A separate report from the CBI, which represents British businesses, also signalled that economic growth weakened in the three months to January, with modest expectations for the next quarter.
The pace of growth dropped to its slowest rate since May 2013, according to this weekend’s CBI Growth Indicator, which collates the views of 759 businesses cross the manufacturing, retail and services sectors. But the outlook for the next three months was more positive, with an above average rise in output expected.
“The overall domestic outlook still looks fairly secure, and a rise in output across all sectors is expected in the coming three months. Low inflation, strong employment growth and rises in real pay also put households in a good position,” said CBI director of economics Rain Newton-Smith.
“But we’ll need to keep watch on whether slower growth in parts of the service sector is the start of something more prolonged, particularly in light of global financial market volatility.”"
Interest rates|Economics viewpoint|Economics|Bank of England|Global economy|Chinese economy|European Central Bank|comment,2016-01-31T15:30:28,guardian,Phillip Inman,Mark Carney has been dealt a weak hand and his forecast that borrowing costs would soon rise exposed as a bluff. A move into negative rates is more likely,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/31/bank-of-england-governor-bluffing-interest-rates,Has the Bank of England governor been caught bluffing on interest rates?,en,business|economics,,"It will probably be “no change” at the Bank of England this week, with policymakers expected to keep interest rates at their historic low again.
The monetary policy committee meets on Thursday and in all probability will sit on its hands for the 83rd straight month. Most likely the MPC will keep the base rate at 0.5% for the rest of the year.
Andy Haldane, the Bank’s chief economist, has said the central bank might be forced to cut rates if the global economy, brought low by China’s faltering manufacturing sector, keeps sliding backwards.
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it’s Super Thursday Read more
Just nine months ago it was all so different. Governor Mark Carney was warning City investors not to bet against a rate rise. His message was as much for Britain’s mortgage payers as it was the bankers. Don’t go on a spending binge with the proceeds of unnaturally low rates, he implied, higher borrowing costs are coming down the track.
A generous view of Carney’s speeches at the time would be that he understood the world economy was too weak to raise rates and the only way for him to overcome a sense of complacency among borrowers was to deliver a message that would, over time, be revealed as hollow, but did the trick at the time.
If it was a ploy, it was one he repeated in autumn when he almost derided Haldane’s concerns that the post-crash global economy was in difficulty and might need a cut in rates to boost investment and spending.
Wise heads nodded and muttered about Haldane’s alienation on the monetary policy committee. Carney’s voice was cool, and above all positive.
He was forced to change his stance in the new year when figures from China that were expected to show a bottoming out of its 18-month slowdown instead revealed a further descent. That triggered another collapse in commodities, for which China is the biggest market. Oil prices hit $27 per barrel, after starting 2014 above $115. Copper, zinc and steel have likewise tumbled in price.
This leaves Carney in the same position as every gambler who succeeds by luck and bluffing. You must ask yourself how long before someone twigs.
There were a handful in the City and the academic community who said the Bank’s forecasting was deeply flawed. Like James Bond in Casino Royale, they detected an opponent who was bluffing. Arch criminal Le Chiffre thinks he has everyone fooled, but a twitchy finger on his temple tells the MI6 agent his hand is weak.
Carney doesn’t twitch or stroke his ear when rattled. Yet he has been bluffing for so long it’s a wonder the British public still pays him any attention. All last year he told us that interest rates were going to rise sooner rather than later. And now he says the opposite.
He would say the facts changed. But have they really? Apart from the US, all major central banks have talked about coping with a deteriorating situation for at least the last year.
His defence can also count on the small group of economists who argue he was not bullish enough then and even now should just get on with lifting borrowing costs.
This group looks narrowly at the UK’s rising employment levels, rising wages (relative to zero inflation), healthy corporate profits and vigorous banking system and argues that the recovery is complete. Normal service from the Bank of England, in the form of higher interest rates, should now resume, they argue.
Yet this analysis ignores the outside world and the fact that around a third of Britain’s GDP relates to trade with the outside world. This has many knock-on effects, meaning the UK catches a cold when others sneeze. That metaphor once belonged to our relationship with the US, but now applies to Europe and east Asia, which has become the fulcrum of the world’s manufacturing.
This brings us back to Haldane’s point and the likelihood that the next change in policy is the announcement of a cut, not a rise.
The MPC could cut the base rate to zero, or even go further and charge depositors for parking their money in Threadneedle Street. That would put it in good company; the European Central Bank already imposes negative interest rates and since last week, so does the Japanese central bank.
Both the ECB in Frankfurt and Tokyo’s Bank of Japan aim to generate consumer and business demand with a costly disincentive to save. It is a message to domestic firms and shoppers alike to spend. It is also a message to foreign savers to take their money elsewhere, with the crucial side-effect that a fall in demand for the host currency will make its value fall.
That is the express aim of the Japanese move to negative interest rates and the disguised motive of Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB.
A lower value currency increases the cost of imports and domestic prices. This increase in inflation will counteract the drag on prices from falling oil prices. Most importantly, it also cuts the cost of exported goods, which should increase demand abroad, raise production and employment, wages and consumer demand.
If Japan and Europe have chosen this route to boost their domestic economies, who is Britain to stand aside? When we resisted currency depreciation in the five years ahead of the 2008 crash, the pound was almost worth $2 and hampered large areas of manufacturing industry.
Carney knows this. A sense of embarrassment will stop the MPC from cutting rates, but there will be plenty of hints to that effect. Carney will be bluffing again in his speeches when he talks about the possibility of following Draghi and his Tokyo counterpart, Haruhiko Kuroda. But bluffing is what he does best.
And all the time he will hope the cards are kind to him. He knows cutting rates will have only limited benefit and raising them risks choking off what recovery there is.
These are desperate times for central bankers. They are the guardians of prosperity."

Freshly published minutes of a November meeting of the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which includes train operators and Network Rail, show that executives discussed privatising the rail infrastructure along the lines of utility firms.
Unions fear Network Rail facing privatisation amid budget crisis Read more
The government commissioned an independent review of Network Rail’s structure and financing to be conducted by Nicola Shaw, the chief executive of HS1, after spiralling costs led to the shelving of promised rail upgrades in its £38.3bn five-year plan last June. Shaw is due to report in time for a potential announcement by George Osborne in the 2016 budget.
In discussing its own submission to Shaw’s work two months ago, train companies suggested that the privatisation of utilities companies was a precedent to follow, arguing that routes needed to be removed from Network Rail’s control.
However, moves to privatise the infrastructure would be highly controversial given the experience of the late 1990s, when a series of disasters occurred under the Railtrack regime.
Shaw’s initial scoping report set out options that ranged from “full privatisation to full nationalisation”. Network Rail’s chief executive, Mark Carne, has proposed devolution of many functions to regional route managers. But others at the RDG favoured a full breakup, arguing that his plan could fail to “attract investors if the centre was still holding control”.
The minutes say that the group – which included the bosses of most UK train operators, as well as Carne – “explored the issue in more detail, considering the privatisation of utility services and London Buses, and the UKFI, as alternative models, and the various funding options available”.
Lilian Greenwood, Labour’s shadow transport spokeswoman, urged the government not to repeat the mistakes of Railtrack.
“There are areas where Network Rail needs to improve but more fragmentation and more privatisation are the last thing that passengers need. Selling off our rail infrastructure shouldn’t even be on the table but the government is actively deciding whether to press ahead,” said Greenwood.
“Such a policy risks dragging us back to the dark days of Railtrack when passengers’ safety was endangered and the country’s network ground to a halt. The Conservative party tested the theory to destruction 20 years ago but it seems that they have learned nothing from the mistakes of the past.
“If rail services are to improve then we need more public ownership, not less. Ministers must reject these calls from train companies and rule out the privatisation of Network Rail.”
The RDG’s eventual submission to the Shaw review did not take a formal position and said there was a range of views expressed by members, but it included a proposal for a partial sell-off of a section of the rail network in England to test the water.
It stated: “There are options for early sale of an English route … Such a sale would introduce an alternative source of finance and greater local focus on customers, clients and stakeholders as well as creating a truly independent comparator which could help to create more effective incentives for improvement in the remaining routes. Following any initial sale, it would be possible to sell further routes but a decision on this could be made in the light of progress and results.”
Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the RDG, said it was right to consider how best to manage the railway infrastructure.
“Nicola Shaw has set out the sale of Network Rail routes as one of many options she is considering as part of her review and our members have therefore discussed its merit.”
“Train companies support the plans for devolution already set out by Network Rail as a way to increase accountability, but also believe it’s important to retain the benefits of a single national network. There is a broad range of views among our members about the appropriate pace and extent of any further change beyond those already set out by Network Rail,” Plummer added.
While the privatisation of utilities such as water and electricity, which were split up into private sector firms in the early 1990s, caused controversy over higher tariffs, the safety record associated with similar moves in rail has made it potentially even more politically fraught.
Network Rail was established after the brief and disastrous tenure of Railtrack between 1996 and 2002, which went into administration after a series of fatal accidents culminating in the Hatfield disaster in 2000. Railtrack was also criticised for mismanagement that was most spectacularly shown in the £9bn upgrade of the westcoast mainline, more than three times its original budget."

The Financial Conduct Authority is expected to face criticism on Monday when MPs debate a motion on whether it is up to the job of regulating behaviour in the City.
The debate, tabled by Conservative MP Guto Bebb, will discuss “that this House believes that the Financial Conduct Authority in its current form is not fit for purpose; and has no confidence in its existing structure and procedures”.
George Osborne appoints Andrew Bailey as FCA chief Read more
Speaking ahead of the debate, Bebb, who has campaigned for better treatment for small business, said he was motivated to table the debate after the FCA pulled its review into banking culture at the end of last year.
“Anybody who knows banks will find it impossible to say that bank behaviour was [not] motivated by financial inducement,” the MP for Aberconwy said.
“We need to have a proper debate about what is going on with the FCA, how independent are they,” said Bebb.
The decision by the FCA to abandon a review into the culture of banks sparked a series of accusations that the Treasury had intervened – strongly denied by both the regulator and the Treasury – as part of a softer approach to the City.
The motion will be heard just days after George Osborne stunned the City by naming Andrew Bailey, a deputy governor of the Bank of England and the head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, as the chief executive of the FCA.
New year, same old story as FCA lets bankers off hook by dropping review Read more
Labour MP John Mann is co-sponsoring the motion and said he has no confidence in the regulator. “It is not fit for purpose,” said Mann, who sits on the Treasury select committee. He is concerned the FCA’s focus is shifting from so-called conduct issues to prudential regulation.
“On Monday I will reveal in the House of Commons a new scandal which the FCA is trying to sweep under the carpet, providing further proof that we need a strong, independent regulator, not another lackey for George Osborne and the banks,” said
Mann.
Mann is expected to accuse the FCA of failing to regulate foreign exchange firms tightly enough, to ensure they don’t offer misleading exchange rates to consumers.
The FCA has only been in existence since April 2013 when the coalition government disbanded the-then City regulator, the Financial Services Authority. The FCA was given responsibility for overseeing the behaviour of the City and the PRA, inside the Bank of England, was charged with regulating whether banks and insurance companies were strong enough to withstand market turbulence.
The FCA and the Treasury declined to comment ahead of the debate. When Bailey was appointed, Osborne had said his appointment was “an important next step in the establishment of the FCA as a strong regulator, independent of government and industry”."
Retail industry|Crime|news,2016-02-01T00:01:12,guardian,Rebecca Smithers,British Retail Consortium blames rise on criminal gangs stealing luxury and hi-tech goods to order with cyber-crime now making up one-third of the cost,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/01/cost-of-uk-retail-soars-to-a-record-613m,Cost of UK retail crime soars to a record £613m,en,business|retail,,"British Retail Consortium blames rise on criminal gangs stealing luxury and hi-tech goods to order with cyber-crime now making up one-third of the cost
The annual bill for UK retail crime soared to £613m last year – the highest level since records began – driven by sophisticated criminal gangs stealing luxury goods such as designer clothing and hi-tech gadgets to order.
That was a 2% increase on the cost to industry in 2014, according to the annual retail crime survey published on Monday by the British Retail Consortium, while the average value of goods stolen leaped by over a third to £325 per incident - also a record.
Not only is the direct cost of crime now at its highest level on record, but it is more than three times higher than in 2007-08, the BRC warned.
The total number of offences has dropped for the second year running, retailers reported, to 750,144 incidents. But the high value of items stolen compared with the drop inincidents shows that crime against retailers is increasingly being carried out by sophisticated criminals stealing to order. Customer theft still accounts for the majority of incidents of retail crime, at 83% of the total.
Survey respondents – which account for 51% of the retail sector by turnover – pointed to the rise in the use of specialist equipment such as de-taggers and foil-lined bags to avoid detection, with 40% of crimes attributed to gangs, often working in groups.
Fraud, including the burgeoning waves of online cyber-attacks, is also on the rise, the report said – up by 55% and, significantly, now accounting for more than a third of the cost of crime against retailers (36%).
The human cost of retail crime has also grown. Data collected revealed a 28% increase in offences involving abuse or violence against shop staff, rising to 41 out of every 1,000 crimes committed, compared to 32 out of 1,000 reported last year.
“These figures demonstrate the growing cost of crime against retailers – both human and financial,” said BRC chief excecutive Helen Dickinson. “At a time when retailers have been cutting the cost of food and clothing to reduce the average price of our weekly shopping baskets, a small number of criminals are using ever more sophisticated techniques to seize luxury items and to target retail employees with abuse and violence in their place of work.”
Dickinson added: “Tightening police budgets inevitably presents difficult choices about policing resources and priorities. This makes the case for police and businesses to tackle retail crime together even stronger.”"

The National Audit Office is to investigate George Osborne’s decision to scrap a £1bn prototype carbon capture scheme which cost the taxpayer at least £60m, a letter seen by the Guardian shows.
The spending watchdog said it would be looking into the expenses incurred in running, and then prematurely halting, a CCS auction. It will also examine how the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) plans to secure the country’s future energy needs.
“In the coming weeks we will begin work looking at particular areas: the costs that government has incurred in running the competition; and the department’s understanding of how the decision to cancel the competition impacts on its aims to maintain security of supply and reduce emissions,” writes Sir Amyas Morse, the auditor general at the NAO.
Cameron faces questions over scrapping of carbon capture scheme Read more
Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy and climate change secretary who originally called for an investigation, said she hoped a light could now be shone on Osborne’s decision, taken in last November’s autumn statement.
“The chancellor’s sudden decision to abandon support for this cutting-edge technology after 10 years of promises hasn’t just damaged investor confidence at a time when we desperately need investment in our energy sector. It also means that millions and millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has been simply wasted,” she said.
“The costs to families and businesses of his short-sighted decision could yet be bigger still because without CCS it will be more expensive to cut emissions. This NAO probe should uncover the full cost to the taxpayer of George Osborne’s broken promise.”
Ministers have also admitted that £222m of public money has been spent overall on carbon, capture and storage (CCS) but they have still not decided what, if any, role it will play.
CCS is a system in which CO2 from a coal- or gas-fired power station can be removed and stored, most likely within an old North Sea oilfield. Carbon is one of the greenhouse gases held responsible for global warming.
The CCS auctions were meant to open the way for an eventual winning consortium to build a prototype that would pave the way for others to follow with commercial schemes.
Shell was developing a trial scheme at Peterhead in Scotland alongside one of the big six energy suppliers and power station owner SSE. A separate White Rose project was being developed by Drax at its coal-fired plant in Selby, North Yorkshire.
Decc said the latest government spending cuts meant difficult decisions had to be made.
“We did not take this decision lightly and it remains the case that CCS has a potential role in the long-term decarbonisation of the UK. We want to make our energy supply as clean as possible, but we will do so in a way that keeps bills as low as possible,” said a Decc spokeswoman.
Energy and climate change minister Andrea Leadsom admitted in response to a parliamentary question from Labour last week that £31m of taxpayer’s money had been spent on White Rose and £28m at Peterhead.
There was no breakdown as to where this money went but Leadsom said £222m had been spent overall since 2011. She also said CCS had not necessarily been ditched completely.
“The government continues to view CCS as having a potential role in the long-term decarbonisation of the UK’s power and industrial sectors,” she added.
The prime minister, David Cameron, defended the scrapping of the CCS auction in front of a parliamentary committee earlier this month saying: “The economics are not working at the moment.”
The Committee on Climate Change, an independent body which advises the government, wrote on Thursday to Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, saying the costs of meeting Britain’s agreed carbon targets would double without CCS.
Labour has amended an energy bill currently making its way through the House of Commons requiring Rudd to bring forward a new CCS strategy within the next 12 months.
When the previous auction for CCS was abandoned in 2011 it prompted an NAO inquiry, which concluded in March 2012. It said: “The department must learn the lessons of the failure of this project if further time is not to be lost, and value for money achieved on future projects.”"
Earthquakes|The Observer|Geology|Natural disasters and extreme weather|news,2017-11-18T22:00:43,guardian,Robin Mckie,Scientists say number of severe quakes is likely to rise strongly next year because of a periodic slowing of the Earth’s rotation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/18/2018-set-to-be-year-of-big-earthquakes,Upsurge in big earthquakes predicted for 2018 as Earth rotation slows,en,world,,"Scientists say number of severe quakes is likely to rise strongly next year because of a periodic slowing of the Earth’s rotation
Scientists have warned there could be a big increase in numbers of devastating earthquakes around the world next year. They believe variations in the speed of Earth’s rotation could trigger intense seismic activity, particularly in heavily populated tropical regions.
Although such fluctuations in rotation are small – changing the length of the day by a millisecond – they could still be implicated in the release of vast amounts of underground energy, it is argued.
The link between Earth’s rotation and seismic activity was highlighted last month in a paper by Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado in Boulder and Rebecca Bendick of the University of Montana in Missoula presented at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America.
“The correlation between Earth’s rotation and earthquake activity is strong and suggests there is going to be an increase in numbers of intense earthquakes next year,” Bilham told the Observer last week.
In their study, Bilham and Bendick looked at earthquakes of magnitude 7 and greater that had occurred since 1900. “Major earthquakes have been well recorded for more than a century and that gives us a good record to study,” said Bilham.

They found five periods when there had been significantly higher numbers of large earthquakes compared with other times. “In these periods, there were between 25 to 30 intense earthquakes a year,” said Bilham. “The rest of the time the average figure was around 15 major earthquakes a year.”
The researchers searched to find correlations between these periods of intense seismic activity and other factors and discovered that when Earth’s rotation decreased slightly it was followed by periods of increased numbers of intense earthquakes. “The rotation of the Earth does change slightly – by a millisecond a day sometimes – and that can be measured very accurately by atomic clocks,” said Bilham.
It is straightforward. The Earth is offering us a five-year heads-up on future earthquakes Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado in Boulder
Bilham and Bendick found that there had been periods of around five years when Earth’s rotation slowed by such an amount several times over the past century and a half. Crucially, these periods were followed by periods when the numbers of intense earthquakes increased.
“It is straightforward,” said Bilham. “The Earth is offering us a five-year heads-up on future earthquakes.”
This link is particularly important because Earth’s rotation began one of its periodic slowdowns more than four years ago. “The inference is clear,” said Bilham. “Next year we should see a significant increase in numbers of severe earthquakes. We have had it easy this year. So far we have only had about six severe earthquakes. We could easily have 20 a year starting in 2018.”
Exactly why decreases in day length should be linked to earthquakes is unclear although scientists suspect that slight changes in the behaviour of Earth’s core could be causing both effects.
In addition, it is difficult to predict where these extra earthquakes will occur – although Bilham said they found that most of the intense earthquakes that responded to changes in day length seemed to occur near the equator. About one billion people live in the Earth’s tropical regions."
Race issues|The Observer|news,2017-11-19T00:05:45,guardian,Jamie Doward,New research suggests that 15% of community reported discrimination,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/19/chinese-community-reports-highest-proportion-of-racial-harassment-in-britain,Chinese report highest levels of racial harassment in UK,en,world,,"Chinese people in Britain report higher levels of racial harassment than any other ethnic group, according to the first study of its kind to be undertaken.
The new research, which will be published this week by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex, suggests that 15% of Chinese men and women reported harassment last year, while between 4% and 10% of men and women from most ethnic minority groups said they experienced racial harassment in the same period.
But 50 years since the first anti-discrimination legislation came into force in the UK, there was a marked decline in reports of racial harassment among what the researchers describe as the most established minority – black Caribbeans, who have the highest proportion of adults aged 60 and over. Reports of harassment were down by 10 percentage points for men and five points for women.
The authors suggest that as older and retired individuals are less likely to visit public places, this sharp decrease for black Caribbeans is not surprising.
Ethnic minorities who live significantly outside multicultural areas were far more likely to experience racial harassment. There was a 14% chance of someone from an ethnic minority experiencing racial harassment if they lived in a predominantly white area. And there was a more than one in 10 chance they would be harassed if they lived in an area where 16% or more of the population had voted BNP or Ukip.
“The prevalence of racial or any other form of harassment is one of the most serious issues facing British society,” said Shamit Saggar, professor of political science and public policy at the University of Essex.
“We know now that place is significant. Ethnic minorities who live outside areas in which minorities cluster are more likely to experience harassment. The question now is how government, local government and other public authorities address how the perpetrators are behaving in these areas and to consider with urgency what can be done to change these behaviours.”
Those who experienced racism would be more prone to avoid certain places for fear of it happening again, the report suggested.
As many as one in five Indian Muslim women said they had felt unsafe or had avoided certain public places in the last year for fear of being harassed. “The study shows that harassment is not a defensive fantasy in the mind of some but rather a genuine harm that affects innocent people each day,” Saggar said. “This is a clear case for fresh and timely action to bear down further on harassment.”
The research found that the fear of being subjected to racial abuse was widespread. “Our study has found that harassment is experienced by the broad population of ethnic minorities, and damages mental health, even among those who do not directly experience it,” said Dr Renee Luthra, director of the Centre for Migration Studies at the University of Essex.
Individuals reporting harassment were not necessarily from the most disadvantaged groups. The authors suggest: “This risk is higher for ethnic minorities who are younger, more highly educated and male. The reported harassment is predicated on being in public places and possibly having the confidence to identify and report it.”
The study’s authors said their work had confirmed a substantial association between ethnic and racial harassment and a deterioration in mental health. They also found that harassment tended to be persistent. Almost one in three people who has experienced harassment will experience it again two years later, they suggest.
Dr Alita Nandi, research fellow at the Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex, said their findings showed there was a need to confront racism at many levels of British society, though the report noted that, since the last comparable survey in 1993, reports of ethnic and racial harassment have decreased slightly by between 2% and 4% for most ethnic groups.
“We hope this evidence will be taken up by law enforcement in identifying high-risk places and making public spaces accessible to all, and by mental health professionals by considering ethnic and racial harassment as an additional factor in mental health issues experienced by ethnic minorities in Britain,” Nandi said."

(Stage)|Harvey Weinstein|Sexual harassment|interviews",2017-11-19T00:05:46,guardian,Rob Walker,One of America’s most politically outspoken standups is finally bringing her savage brand of comedy to Britain,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/19/comedy-standup-margaret-cho-interview-uk-tour,No holds barred and funny as hell: the fierce humour of Margaret Cho,en,culture|stage,,"One of America’s most politically outspoken standups is finally bringing her savage brand of comedy to Britain
If you have never heard of Margaret Cho, think the caustic, crude comedy of Joan Rivers, the politically-charged jibes of Bill Hicks and the quick-witted improvisation of Robin Williams – all rolled into one but with a feisty Korean twist. Now the US comedian is about to embark on a UK tour, starting in Edinburgh on 25 November and ending at the O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire on 10 December.
Cho is a five-time Grammy and Emmy nominee and a household name in America, and earlier this year Rolling Stone magazine named her as one of the 50 best standup comics of all time. She has worked with all the above comics, and others such as Jerry Seinfeld, but says her greatest mentor and influence was Rivers. “I try to carry on her legacy,” she says. “I feel like I learned everything I know from her.”
For a comedian like the openly bisexual Cho, famous for her brazen take on sex and politics, there has never been a better time to hit the road.
With the daily tweet-fest that is the presidency of Donald Trump and the sexual harassment revelations rocking Hollywood, Cho says the material is flowing like never before.
“There’s a lot about Trump, a lot about race and sexuality, and politics. I get to talk about all that kind of stuff, which I think is really important,” she says.
Cho, 48, is also open about having been sexually assaulted and raped by a family friend as a teenager. The allegations about movie mogul Harvey Weinstein have inevitably brought that back – but for her, comedy is healing.
“I never thought I would see anything like this in my lifetime. I’m a survivor of this kind of stuff so it’s really amazing to see it happening,” she says.
“It’s disgusting, but that’s what’s great about comedy. You can take something really terrible and make it funny. And that’s magic, that’s what we all strive for, to take things so dark and so difficult and make them very light,” she says. Dealing with difficult subjects, sometimes in difficult circumstances, is trademark Cho.
At a recent fundraising bash in Washington DC she was waiting in the wings with fellow headliners Jerry Seinfeld and Jay Leno when one of the theatre reps rushed up and whispered in her ear: “Whatever you do, don’t talk about Trump!”
Cho recalls: “Everyone suddenly seemed really scared. It was so weird.” At first she thought it might be the president himself. But as she looked out into the audience, Cho clocked his daughter, Ivanka, with husband Jared Kushner, one of Trump’s closest aides.
There’s a lot about Trump, race and sexuality. I get to talk about all that stuff which I think is really important
She thought about it for a split second, but carried on regardless – lambasting, with her signature savage humour, Trump, Weinstein and “all the bad in our society”. “I won’t be asked back,” she says, laughing. “But that’s OK with me.”
Cho is now looking forward to getting better acquainted with Britain. “Britons know their comedians very well. You see comedians change their shows and come back with a new show every year. So there’s a connection that they have with their audience.
“Comedy in pubs is really there to be the social instigator, and get people talking to each other and getting the social feedback working. Comedians have a different role in society there than they do in America. It’s definitely much more involved.”
Cho draws heavily on her childhood growing up in and around a gay bookstore in San Francisco, which her parents bought when she was seven.
“We sold a lot of gay porn, and that’s pretty crazy for a very Conservative Korean family!” she jokes. It was here, though, that she learned the pain of losing friends, most of them to Aids.
“Aids changed my entire world. That’s the thing I haven’t dealt with as a performer yet. I hadn’t figured out a way to talk about it – until now.”
Like many comedians, it’s her own troubled past that has perhaps been most influential in Cho’s work – in particular her struggle with drug and alcohol abuse.
“Comedy is really about coping. It’s about coping with your own suffering, and your own pain. How do we find a way through that? That’s what comedy is in general. It’s a way to cope. It’s finding a way to survive with all of this happening,” she says.
Sometimes that suffering has spilled over on to the stage. At one sell-out gig in New Jersey last year half the crowd walked out midway through when she appeared to slur and forget her punchlines. Grainy video footage of the event shows fights breaking out and Cho ranting at “over-privileged white people”. At the time she put the fiasco down to grief over the death of fellow comedian Garry Shandling, but not long afterwards she dropped off the circuit altogether.
“I spent about a year and a half in a very closed-off rehab”, she says. “I just didn’t want to go back into the world.”
Now she feels like she’s “come out of the craziness and into the light”, and is ready to make her most troubling experiences part of her standup routine. “The worse the subject the funnier it is, that’s what I think,” she says.
The title of her new show – Fresh Off the Bloat – is itself a reference to being fresh off drugs, alcohol and “the brink of suicide”. For the UK shows, Cho has been busy rewriting a big chunk of her act to catch up with the constant flow of sexual harassment allegations dogging the entertainment industry.
She’s no stranger to Hollywood herself. She was in the film Face/Off with John Travolta and had her own TV sitcom in the 90s, All-American Girl, where she played the rebellious daughter in a traditional Korean-American household. Former boyfriend Quentin Tarantino famously directed one of the episodes.
The pair, she says, recently talked about the Weinstein allegations and their wider impact. “It’s very difficult because it involves all this amazing cinematographic history too. But I think it’s going to be a continual reminder that there’s a lot of bad in our society, and especially in industries like entertainment where there’s so much feeling of absolute power that people have. So I think there’s a lot more to come out. I feel like this is just the beginning, and I’m really grateful for that.”"
Budget 2017 (November)|The Observer|Self-driving cars|Budget|Philip Hammond|news,2017-11-19T10:41:02,guardian,,Embattled chancellor will sweep away regulation to allow testing of cars and put up £1bn for tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/19/self-driving-cars-in-uk-by-2021-hammond-budget-announcement,Budget 2017: UK to launch self-driving cars on British roads by 2021,en,UK,,"Driverless cars will be on Britain’s roads by 2021 as a result of sweeping regulatory reforms that will put the UK in the forefront of a post-Brexit technological revolution, Chancellor Philip Hammond will say this week. In his budget on Wednesday Hammond will allow driverless cars to be tested without any human operator inside or outside the car, and without the legal constraints and rules that apply in many other EU nations, and much of the US.
The move – welcomed by the UK motor industry – is part of an attempt by Hammond and the Treasury to project a more upbeat message about the prospects for the UK economy after Brexit, and focus on opportunities as well as the risks. Carmakers have warned that they may have to move at least some production abroad if there is no deal to keep Britain inside the EU single market and customs union, at least for a two-year transition period.
The Observer view on Philip Hammond’s budget Read more
But Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said it was good news that the government was taking a lead by making the UK attractive to those seeking to develop, test and build an entirely new generation of cars.
He said: “We support government’s measures to make the UK one of the best places in the world to develop, test and sell connected and autonomous vehicles. These vehicles will transform our roads and society, dramatically reducing accidents and saving thousands of lives every year, while adding billions of pounds to the economy. We look forward to continuing industry’s collaboration with government to ensure the UK can be among the first to grasp the benefits of this exciting new technology.”
Lucy Yu, director of public policy at FiveAI, a UK-based leader in self-driving car technology, said: “This news secures the UK’s position as the global leader for self-driving car development and innovation. The government’s commitment to creating a supportive regulatory framework for self-driving vehicles will further our position as a European leader by enabling the development of our technology, and encouraging further investment into the industry as a whole.”
Hammond will say that he is removing the last remaining barrier to the most advanced on-road testing of driverless vehicles. At the same time the Law Commission will set out a new regulatory framework, focusing on liability, so that businesses have the certainty they need for investment.

Hammond, who is under pressure from business, Labour and many MPs in his own party to provide a clearer vision for the economy as the UK prepares to leave the EU in 2019, will say that he wants to “build a country fit for the future and make the UK a leader in the technological revolution”. He will provide £1bn of new spending for hi-tech projects, including £75m for research on artificial intelligence, £400m for electric car charging points and £100m to boost clean car sales.
Following criticism from many pro-Brexit Tory MPs, who say he has been too gloomy about the country’s prospects, the focus on technological change will mark a major shift in emphasis and tone. Hammond is also expected to make housebuilding a central theme, and to announce at least a partial lifting of the 1% cap on pay rises for public sector workers, including nurses and teachers.
Many Tory MPs also want him to set aside extra money to prepare for the possibility of a “no-deal” Brexit. David Jones, former Brexit minister, said he believed at least £1bn should be set aside. “We will need customs infrastructure right across the country, in the major ports. We will also need extra resources in the shape of customs officers and border officials and we will also need extensive IT.
“We should be doing it anyway for two reasons. It gives certainty to business that we are ready if necessary for a no-deal scenario. Secondly, it will give a strong signal to the European Union that we are making preparations – so they shouldn’t try stringing us along in the hope that we will panic. Philip Hammond really has got to show Britain means business.”
With Hammond also under pressure to pump more into the NHS, and to ease upfront costs for businesses, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to limit his room for manoeuvre by downgrading the UK’s growth prospects over the next five years. Analysts expect the OBR to follow the Bank of England’s predictions for GDP growth, which were recently revised down to 1.5% for 2017 and 1.7% for the three subsequent years.
Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the chancellor should abandon rises in business rates planned for next April and pay for this by delaying plans to reduce corporation tax.
Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said it was time for Hammond to be bold, not defensive. “He can start ushering in a new era of housebuilding. By exempting housing investment from his fiscal rules he can avoid the risk of a do-nothing budget with funding for new building, including more affordable housing.”

John McDonnell|The Observer|Labour|Budget 2017 (November)|Budget|Jeremy Corbyn|news,2017-11-19T00:05:46,guardian,Michael Savage,"As the budget looms, the shadow chancellor is even taking advice from Gordon Brown",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/19/john-mcdonnell-prepares-to-step-out-of-the-shadows,"John McDonnell: ‘The Tories have no mission, no objectives’",en,politics,,"With the government in choppy waters and the economy heading for Brexit turbulence, John McDonnell has been practising his captaincy skills. To relax away from Westminster and clear the mind, the would-be chancellor of the exchequer reveals that he and his wife, Cynthia, have been heading for the Norfolk Broads for sailing breaks.
“We decided we needed to do a sport together, some activity, so we took up dinghy sailing.” He hoots with laughter, recalling the original name of the vessel they bought a few years ago. “Believe it or not, I think it was called the Morning Star. Pure coincidence! The name has dropped off now. These days we just call it the boat.”
He scrolls through some pictures on his phone until he finds one featuring his friend Jeremy Corbyn, who stayed with the McDonnells recently at a hut they own next to their mooring.
“Look – there he is. Classic Jeremy,” he says pointing at a figure in the distance, standing perilously close to what look likes the end of a jetty. “Can you see him? And I’m saying ‘get down! You are going to cause a byelection!’” McDonnell is under no illusions about his or his wife’s sailing abilities. “We’re rubbish,” he admits. “People get off the water when they see us coming because (he shakes his head) … it’s terrible.”
The shadow chancellor, a self-proclaimed Marxist, can be engaging company. He has rarely been asked much about this side of his life, the one away from politics – but he seems comfortable opening up about it. “I read a lot, theatre, cinema, the rest of it,” he says. He is happy, too, talking about how he got to where he is today, the early steps on his extraordinary journey to the top echelons of the Labour party.
McDonnell was born in Liverpool, did his A-levels in Burnley, then made his way via Brunel University into the trades union movement while at the same time working as a “house father” in a children’s home in Hillingdon, west London, for 13 years, looking after 10 youngsters. These days he has his own large family: two daughters from a first marriage, a son from his second, and five grandchildren. “They’re all descending on me this weekend, the northern tribe,” he says. “It will be fun.”
Now aged 66, his time to enjoy life outside Westminister is more squeezed than ever. Relatively late in life, huge levels of political responsibility have been thrust on his shoulders. Throughout the New Labour years McDonnell was a lonely figure on the party’s far left, along with Corbyn. Both were largely ignored by the media. Before Wednesday’s budget, however, he is being scrutinised as never before – not only because he is in charge of Labour’s economic policy, but because he is in effect auditioning for the chancellor’s role.
If he feels pressure, he disguises it well, joking about his years opposing his own party. “Gordon Brown, bless him, said the other night that John McDonnell was always shadow chancellor because he was always the shadow. I’d always do an alternative budget [to Brown’s] and get up and present it in parliament.”
These days, though, McDonnell is having to think not about being the rebel within, but about leading and governing. He says that Corbyn approached Theresa May’s office last week to ask if all the shadow ministerial teams could have access to civil servants, so they could learn the ropes of running government departments.
What could happen is beginning to sink in, he says. Recently the shadow cabinet devoted an entire meeting to hearing from the former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake, and others with experience in Whitehall, about what government actually involves.
“A whole team came in to talk about structures of government, how government operates, style of government, culture of government, that sort of thing.” McDonnell says he is seeking advice wherever he can find it, including from Brown. “I’ll be sitting down with Gordon and some of his people that he had around him as well. It’s exciting. The prospects are exciting, but I am not getting carried away.”
McDonnell is cautious. He has not spent a lifetime fighting Tories without knowing their ability to reinvent themselves to keep power. Of May’s current government he says: “I think they’re disintegrating, on a slow retreat to oblivion, but I never underestimate them and their ability to cling on.”
Given that he is from the far left, he also knows that he has to bring his own party and more of the electorate with him. His own economic policy programme involving the mass renationalisation of public utilties, £250bn of public spending, higher taxes for the better off, big cash injections into the public services including an extra £6bn immediately for the NHS, and a huge housebuilding programme, is more leftwing than any put forward by Labour in living memory.
It scares the living daylights out of the remnants of New Labour. As does McDonnell himself. He is seen by many MPs on the right of the party and those who would place themselves in its political centre as a dangerous revolutionary (more so than Corbyn) – and not just on economics. Many are convinced his real mission is to ensure total control by the hard left of all Labour party structures, from the ruling NEC down to local constituency parties, so he and Corbyn can show their true colours and squash opposition once in power.
If that is the agenda, he is hiding it for now, focusing on messages around which much of the party can unite relatively easily. Last week he set out five demands for Philip Hammond’s budget that caused no serious disquiet among Labour MPs: to pause and fix universal credit; provide new funding to lift the public sector pay cap; provide large-scale extra funding for infrastructure; properly fund health, education and local government; and launch a large-scale public housebuilding programme.
With another general election a distinct possibility soon, McDonnell and Corbyn are packaging themselves not as the radical old left reborn, but as the new left in the mainstream. McDonnell says the country at large is coming to realise that the Tories govern only for the elites and that his agenda answers contemporary concerns about that unfairness.
“This corporate capture by this government isn’t just alienating the ordinary working-class people because of the impact of austerity, it’s actually undermining the base of those middle earners, if you like,” he says. “When people are having those school gate conversations saying, ‘oh they’ve just laid off so and so, our teaching assistant in the class’, or ‘last night I was at A&E and we waited eight hours before we actually saw anyone’ and then they read about the Paradise Papers and the super-rich avoiding taxes, no wonder people are getting angry.”
Why though, given all this and the hopelessness of the Tories, is Labour not soaring ahead of the Conservatives? And why are he and Corbyn still lagging behind May and Hammond in the economic credibility ratings? In today’s Opinium survey for the Observer, Labour is just two points ahead of the Tories (42% against 40%) after one of the most catastrophic periods for a Conservative government in living memory.
Is it not extraordinary that the prime minister and chancellor remain the most trusted on the economy, with 36% preferring them to run the economy, against the 28% who favour Corbyn and McDonnell?
McDonnell insists the ratings will improve. He was proved right before the last election when no one thought Labour would surge. “No one believed me,” he says.
The shadow chancellor has been looking back at the records and says sudden leaps only happen for oppositions as a result of cataclysmic events. “The Labour party went ahead in the polls immediately after [the UK exit from] the ERM. That is when the 20 points emerged. So, in opposition, unless there’s something cataclysmic, you don’t usually don’t have those leaps, but you steadily build and that is what we are doing.”
Given how far he has come in the last three years, McDonnell prefers to think the dream revival of his career will continue. He and his great friend Corbyn have enjoyed a staggering journey from obscurity to the brink of power since the election of 2015.
But surely he must worry that it could go wrong. He must know fairytales aren’t real, that chancellors and prime ministers fall out.
If they become neighbours in Downing Street might not the relationship between Corbyn and McDonnell become as acrimonious as that between Blair and Brown?
“Jeremy and I have worked together for 35 years,” he says. “We’ve watched our backs for 35 years. Sometimes we’ve been swimming against the stream on our own. We’re mates, we’re friends, our politics are the same. We work very closely together.”
Wednesday’s budget will be the next staging post, McDonnell believes. He thinks there will be general election soon because there is nothing Hammond or May can really do this week or in the near future to revive their party.
“If Hammond uses the budget to try to buy off the individual factions in the Tory party it’ll be chaos,” says McDonnell. “And if he doesn’t, they will remain just as split as they are now.
“They’ve got no mission, no objectives and I think they realise. What is the point of them being there?”

JM Barrie|The Observer|Theatre|news,2017-11-19T00:05:46,guardian,Vanessa Thorpe,"A century after it was written, the Peter Pan author’s Dear Brutus returns to the theatre, writes Vanessa Thorpe",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/19/jm-barrie-dear-brutus-adult-neverland-play-stage-revival,‘It’s Peter Pan for grown-ups’: play by Barrie is back on stage,en,culture|books,,"Neverland, the magical place made famous by JM Barrie’s Peter Pan, will be closer than you think this Christmas – not just for lost boys but for grown-ups as well. The enchanting garden in Scotland that gave Barrie the idea for his classic children’s story also later inspired him to write another play, this time placing a group of fictional adult characters alone in a beautiful natural environment. And now the little-known work, Dear Brutus, is to be revived on the London stage for the first time in more than 20 years.
In a time of austerity and hard political challenges, the director of the play believes the British public’s need to escape to the solace and freedom of a magical world could not be greater. “Although the concerns of Barrie’s audience were different, they probably felt very similar in terms of their anxiety. Our audience, in the middle of fears about terrorism and politics, I am sure really want to escape the world around them,” said Jonathan O’Boyle, director of Dear Brutus, which opens at Southwark Playhouse on 29 November.
“This play was written over a decade after Peter Pan. It was performed in 1917 and written the year before, so the kind of enchanted world Barrie created served a different purpose. By then he had seen the impact of war and his marriage had broken down. So, in this mood, he wanted to write a comic fantasy for adults, with much darker concerns. It does create a Neverland for grown-ups because Act 2 is set in an English wood that offers a mysterious second chance for his eight central characters. It is the kind of transformative natural environment we see in Shakespeare’s plays, such as A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”
Barrie’s enchanted forest is inhabited by an elderly Puck figure, or master of ceremonies, called Lob, while among the marooned group, which include a philanderer and his neglected wife, a snob and a supercilious aristocrat, is a jaded artist called Will Dearth. O’Boyle said: “This artist can’t have children and yet in the woods he is given a child; a daughter that goes on to play a rather sinister role in his life.”
The title of Barrie’s play comes from a line in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar: “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves”, and it expresses the play’s argument that everyone should take greater personal responsibilty for the way their life goes. Reviewing a Nottingham production of Dear Brutus, the Guardian’s Michael Billington was struck by its clear influence on dramatists to come. “This is the precursor of Priestley’s time-plays and Ayckbourn’s comic meditations on chance,” he wrote. “Barrie also dramatises, with bruising honesty, his own obsession with childhood innocence and emotional loss.”
And it is not just Dear Brutus that is being brought back to life. Up in Dumfries, tucked behind the Georgian townhouse where the young Barrie lived until 1878, restoration work on the original garden itself is well under way, ahead of a reopening planned for next year.

Proof of the power of Barrie’s memory of playing in the garden at Moat Brae in Dumfries comes from a passage about Peter Pan in his 1904 memoir: “Our escapades in a certain Dumfries garden, which was an enchanted land to me, was certainly the genesis of this work.”
The author also referred to it in 1924. Awarded the freedom of the city, he told the townspeople: “There is a certain Dumfries garden that is enchanted land for me.”
And it is this “enchanted land” that has been the saviour for members of the Peter Pan Moat Brae Trust, working to restore and preserve the property. “It has been a long journey,” said Cathy Agnew, project director of the trust. “But in the end it has been people’s strong feelings about Neverland that have helped us raise the money for the house as well.”
A sandstone mansion, Moat Brae was designed by architect Walter Newall for a local solicitor, Henry Gordon. His sons, Stuart and Hal, were schoolfriends of the young Barrie at the neighbouring Dumfries Academy, whose tales of pirates, fairies and lost boys are thought to be partly based on their games together in the garden. The house was later run as a nursing home and has since been on the brink of demolition at least once. It was sold at auction in 2000 and set for residential development nine years later until, at the 11th hour, the trust prevented the housing authority works and saved the interior of the building.
Later that year the housing association sold the building to the trust for £1 and the work to raise £5.8m to turn it into a national centre for children’s literature began. Renovations include a plan to recreate the attic as a 19th-century children’s nursery, familiar to readers of Peter Pan, and to restore the gardens to their original design.
Joanna Lumley, patron of the trustand a fan of the book, has promoted the long campaign. In 2013 she said: “The idea this old and beautiful house can be saved and become a children’s literature centre for Scotland is brilliant. When I heard about it, it was just like Tinker Bell had gone ‘ping’ on my head with her wand – it seemed such a wonderful idea.”
Local children will open the centre next year and a grand national opening of Moat Brae is planned for April 2019."

NHS England’s instructions, intended to avoid a repeat of hospitals’ descent into the sort of meltdown seen last year, also say that patients should not have to wait more than 15 minutes in the back of an ambulance outside an A&E unit as they wait to be handed over to hospital staff.
Critics have described the plans, outlined in a four-page letter sent to hospital chiefs as “la-la land”, “totally unrealistic” and an attempt “to create Narnia”. Hospital bosses say they regularly have to use all the three tactics which the NHS wants to ban in order to help them cope with the influx of patients created by winter weather and seasonal infections.
“We all aspire to avoiding doing any of those things. But trying to flog a dead horse, or to create Narnia, through a new set of executive instructions isn’t going to help us,” said Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors.
“Our urgent and emergency care system is under extreme stress going into winter. Given that hospitals are underbedded and underfunded, and emergency departments are understaffed, trying to deliver performance in that climate is nigh-on impossible. We have to define reality rather than delude ourselves about the scale of this problem of caring safely for patients during winter.”
One NHS trust chief executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “They are barking mad. Patients are waiting on corridors already. This will only get worse as we progress through winter. Twelve-hour trolley breaches in some hospitals are no longer unusual, and for some no longer cause distress or outrage as they are viewed as inevitable. The demands are not realistic.”
Disclosure of NHS England’s attempt to impose a detailed series of duties on hospitals comes amid claims by senior insiders that its leadership is in a state of panic over winter.
Theresa May has told Simon Stevens, the organisation’s chief executive, that he is “personally responsible” for how the NHS performs during what most expect to be a very tough winter, with a flu outbreak feared. Some NHS bosses believe that the prime minister’s move is intended to protect Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, who they blame for underfunding it and presiding over huge staffing problems.
The regulator NHS Improvement warned last week that the service was already under such pressure, with hospital wards too full after the failure of a £1bn exercise to free up 2,000-3,000 beds, that it was in an “extremely challenging” position.
NHS England’s plans are laid out in a letter sent to all 233 NHS trusts and 209 clinical commissioning groups on 7 June by Pauline Philip, its national director of urgent and emergency care, headed “Winter briefing one: operational management of winter – expectations and communication”. Philip sets out actions “to consistently ensure that safety is maintained during times of significant pressure”. They include an edict that “clinical escalation will need to ensure that patients are not cared for on hospital corridors; 12-hour trolley waits in the emergency department never happen; [and] patients do not wait more than 15 minutes in ambulances before being handed over to the hospital”.
But hospital bosses claim their struggle to keep up with the sheer demand for care over winter, while maintaining patient safety, forces them to deploy the three practices Philip wants to end. Another chief executive said: “This is totally la-la land thinking. The pressure is mounting now. I don’t think any of the areas ‘to be avoided’ will be. Many chairs and non-executive directors of trusts are in complete disbelief about NHS England’s tone and approach.” Serious doubts have been raised about the ability of hospitals to do what Philip has asked. For instance, 1,597 patients had to wait at least 12 hours in an A&E unit to be admitted into the hospital itself in January to March this year, when cold weather caused a spike in illness that led to the NHS experiencing its most pressurised winter ever. So many hospitals struggled so much last January that the British Red Cross called the situation “a humanitarian crisis”.
NHS England, working alongside NHS Improvement and Public Health England, have made unprecedented joint efforts to ensure the health service can withstand this winter’s rigours. For example, NHSE has put £237m into a campaign to offer free flu jabs to a record 21m people including expanded numbers of primary schoolchildren and, for the first time, care home staff.
Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said hospitals would do everything they could to avoid trolley waits or patients being treated on corridors, and minimise patient handover times between ambulance and A&E staff. But he added: “The indications are that flu may cause more problems than we have seen in recent years. And a prolonged cold spell – often linked to falls and respiratory problems – could make matters worse. So we need to be realistic and honest.
“Trusts cannot guarantee that these problems will not happen. What they can do – and are doing – is to have strong and well developed plans in place to identify when they are struggling to cope, so they can call on support to ensure patients get the best care possible.”"
Technology|The Observer|Facebook|Twitter|Privacy & the media|Privacy|news,2017-11-19T00:05:46,guardian,Anushka Asthana,Cross-party campaign on data protection likely to defeat government,https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2017/nov/19/children-young-people-privacy-technology,Tech giants face tough curbs to protect teenagers’ privacy,en,home,,"Tech firms could be subjected to tough new regulations to prevent teenagers being bombarded by targeted advertising and endless notifications, and routinely having their location tracked by GPS.
The new measures to protect the privacy and mental health of children are being proposed by a cross-party campaign that is likely to inflict a defeat on the government within weeks.
An amendment from the crossbencher and film director Lady (Beeban) Kidron to a bill going through the House of Lords has won the support of senior Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems. Its backers say a barrage of information, based on data-gathering, is causing social anxieties, affecting young people’s sleep and poses a risk of personal information being disseminated online.
The amendment to the data protection bill, laid down by Kidron, calls for technology companies to be subject to “minimum standards of age-appropriate design”. She said ministers who are resisting the move should not be “put off by tech lobbyists”.
Sources have told the Observer that the government is likely to face defeat if it fails to offer a concession before a vote scheduled for mid-December. If the amendment is passed, the government would then have to decide whether it is willing to countenance the political headache of attempting to remove it in the Commons.
The push has the backing of the high-profile Conservative peer Dido Harding, the former chief executive of TalkTalk, who told the Observer she had come to the decision with a “heavy heart”: “I’ve spent years in telecoms thinking that competition drives the right outcomes, but it doesn’t appear to be happening. I would love to believe that commercial platforms will move fast enough that you don’t have to regulate, but there is no sign of that.”
“It is difficult to reach consensus when there is no referee in the room. To make sure children are protected, we should set standards.”
Harding added that society did not think twice about setting health and safety standards for children’s toys, or regulating television programmes. “I know the positive power of the digital world – but there are downsides as well as the upsides,” she said, describing how GPS could help people and companies to know children’s location, and how devices made young people vulnerable to bullying 24 hours a day.
“You can’t make people completely safe but you can provide a seatbelt,” she added.
Kidron has argued that the key is preventing the commercial imperatives of large companies being prioritised over the rights and wellbeing of children. She said “eye-watering and inappropriate data-harvesting” being used to profile young people had major implications.
Her amendment suggests age-appropriate design could include: ensuring high privacy settings are switched on by default when a user is under 16; not revealing GPS locations; preventing data from being widely shared; and giving children time off from endless notifications during school and sleep hours. It could also require commercially driven content presented to children to be clearly identified.
Matt Hancock, the digital minister, said the government sympathised with the sentiment behind the amendment but disagreed that it represented the best way forward: “Earlier this year we legislated for a new code of practice for social media companies, and are consulting on our internet safety strategy which will put it into practice,” he said. “We want to keep children safe online, but this particular amendment risks creating confusion about data protection responsibilities.”"
Russia|The Observer|Television industry|Conservatives|Labour|news,2017-11-18T21:00:42,guardian,Jamie Doward,Commons register of interests shows satirical show has employed at least 10 Tory and Labour politicians,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/18/mps-kremlin-propaganda-channel-rt,"MPs defend fees of up to £1,000 an hour to appear on ‘Kremlin propaganda’ channel",en,world,,"MPs who have accepted up to £1,000 an hour to appear on television shows broadcast on RT, formerly Russia Today, have defended their links to the station, classed by the US government last week as a Kremlin propaganda vehicle.
Analysis of the Commons register of interests for the last two years show at least 10 have been paid handsomely for appearing on the channel, which is now coming under acute scrutiny after both the US and UK governments accused Russia of meddling in elections and pushing fake news.
David Davies, the Tory MP for Monmouth, who was paid £750 an hour plus travel costs for four appearances between last December and September, said he had no regrets about appearing on one of the channel’s shows, Sam Delaney’s News Thing.
“The News Thing has given me a fair chance to explain my opinions on Brexit immigration and transgender issues, for which I am grateful,” Davies said. “Sadly, I have not received the same courtesy from the British Broadcasting Corporation. Instead, on several occasions, its highly paid presenters have criticised me by name without giving me a right of response.”
Mike Freer, now an assistant government whip, who was paid £1,000 an hour for two appearances in January and April last year, told the Jewish Chronicle: “I appeared on Sam Delaney’s News Thing, an independent production that is satirical in nature. I went on to poke fun at [Vladimir] Putin, which I did.”
However, Labour’s David Lammy, who, according to his register of members interests was paid £1,000 for two hours of his time on two occasions, is understood to have ruled out further appearances, despite being asked on an almost weekly basis.
Many MPs appeared reluctant to discuss their appearances, including Labour newcomer Rosie Duffield, who was paid £500 for three hours for her appearance on the channel; Tory MP Johnny Mercer, a former soldier, who received £1,000 for three hours of his time on two separate occasions; and the former deputy speaker, Tory MP Nigel Evans, who was paid £750 an hour on two occasions.
Duffield defended her appearance on Twitter. Last month she tweeted: “Worked on Sam Delaney’s show in July, paid by production company, not RT.”
The biggest earner was the former Respect MP George Galloway, who, between November 2013 and February 2015, was paid more than £100,000 to front his own show on RT. It is unclear how much the former first minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, now hosting a talkshow on the channel, will earn.
Others who have appeared on RT include Nigel Farage and former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell. It is not clear whether either was paid.
More MPs may be inclined to distance themselves from RT now that all material broadcast in the US by RT will have to be flagged to viewers as “on behalf of” the Russian government.
The decision prompted former London mayor Ken Livingstone to urge the channel “to sail on telling the truth that you believe”.
But others are wary about its reach and influence. An unclassified version of a January US intelligence report said RT and a sister website, Sputnik, were key weapons used by Russia to interfere in the US presidential election.
The European Values thinktank, which has received money from the UK and US governments, as well as the European commission, recently published a report that listed more than 2,000 US and European politicians who have appeared on RT.
Monika Richter, the report’s author, said RT’s purpose was “to fundamentally pollute the information space”.
“People who don’t understand this issue very well might think it’s harmless to appear on a satirical show, but it’s a failure of judgment and a lack of imagination in understanding how insidious the whole machine is,” she said."
Brexit|The Observer|International trade|European Union|Global economy|Economics|Foreign policy|news,2017-11-19T00:05:46,guardian,Michael Savage|Daniel Boffey,"No bespoke trade deal can be as good as the single market, says Sir Martin Donnelly",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/19/hard-brexit-highly-damaging-says-former-top-civil-servant-martin-donnelly,"Hard Brexit highly damaging, says former top civil servant",en,politics,,"No bespoke trade deal can be as good as the single market, says Sir Martin Donnelly
There is no trade deal on offer from the European Union that will stop Britain taking a major economic hit after Brexit, the government’s former top trade official has warned.
In a direct warning to MPs, Sir Martin Donnelly, the chief civil servant in Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade until earlier this year, states that leaving the single market in favour of negotiating a long-winded, Canada-style trade deal will “damage UK competitiveness and leave us with less investment, lower living standards and long queues at the border”.
Donnelly, who left the trade department earlier this year and who has extensive experience working in Brussels, writes in the Observer that there is no credible free trade deal on offer “able to deliver the guaranteed market access, shared regulation and consumer protection that Britain needs”.
“Vote to leave the single market if you must. But do it with your eyes open,” he tells MPs. “Wishful thinking does not create well-paid jobs, pay taxes or fund public services.”
He warns that leaving the EU’s legal structures will leave Britain “more protected, more regulated and poorer”.
We shouldn’t even be contemplating leaving the single market Read more
His intervention comes days after a leaked European commission document suggested that Britain would not be offered a bespoke trade deal granting access to the single market for goods and services. It also comes with the government fighting to contain a Brexit crisis on several fronts: it could face a Commons defeat as early as Tuesday over a rebel attempt to ensure that the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights continues to have effect after Brexit.
The Observer has also learned that senior legal figures in the Lords are poised to ensure that rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) still have a place in UK courts after Brexit.
Lord Pannick QC, who defeated the government in court over its attempt to trigger Brexit without a vote in parliament, said he would step in to change the EU withdrawal bill if ministers did not clarify the “uncertainty” over EU law after Brexit day.
“We need clarity on whether judges should, other than in exceptional circumstances, follow judgments of the European Court of Justice on the retained EU law which will be part of domestic law after Brexit,” he said. “[The current bill] gives inadequate guidance to our judges.
“When the withdrawal bill comes to the House of Lords, I will be tabling an amendment to require domestic courts to interpret retained EU law consistently with the judgments of the court of justice handed down post-Brexit, unless the domestic court is satisfied that there are exceptional reasons not to do so.
“Such an amendment is designed to promote legal certainty, and to ensure consistency between the retained EU law and the same laws in Europe, which is especially important to promote trade with Europe, to ensure freedom of services, for data protection, safeguarding the environment, protecting employment rights and in many other fields.”

That move will infuriate Brexiters and also contradicts Theresa May, who has made jurisdiction of the ECJ a red line in Brexit talks.
Meanwhile, senior ministers will have a crunch meeting on Monday over how to unlock Brexit talks with the EU, with foreign secretary Boris Johnson wanting guarantees over a future trade deal before committing to a major increase in the divorce bill.
In his Observer article, Donnelly spells out that the benefits Britain enjoys from its single market membership cannot be replicated in a trade deal. He urges MPs unsure about what form the final Brexit deal should take to buy themselves time by backing temporary membership of the European Economic Area, which comes with single market access, for a transition period. Doing so will allow more time to “see if we can find a realistic alternative that meets our economic needs”.
“Please don’t throw away our hard-won competitiveness, our knowledge-based economy which attracts global talent and investment, and our successful services sector because of false promises that we can leave the single market and everything will be fine,” he warns MPs. “That is not what the facts tell us.”
A similar warning has already been issued by Sir Ivan Rogers, the former ambassador to the EU, who said that there was a “radical difference” between the free trade arrangement that Britain would be offered and membership of the customs union and the single market that it was giving up.
A senior EU official hit back against David Davis’s claim during a speech in Berlin last week that the UK should enjoy a better deal than Norway, due to its comparative size. The official in Brussels told the Observer, however, that suggestions from British politicians that the UK could remodel its economy to be more like Singapore had cut through to EU leaders.
“They are saying ‘But we are a big country so we can get something better than Norway’. My answer is ‘no, it is the other way round’. Norway is a fisheries and oil economy. They are not a competitor. You, the UK, are a competitor. Particularly when it comes to safeguards against various types of dumping. Threats have been made and safeguards will have to be introduced.”
Meanwhile, businesses are also increasing their lobbying over the effects of leaving the EU with no deal. The tourism industry has privately warned that 25,000 jobs held by Britons working in the industry in Europe, as well as £1bn in tax revenue, are at risk.
Eloise Todd, head of the pro-Remain Best for Britain campaign, said: “In the week of the budget, this is further evidence that we are facing a Brexit black hole at the heart of our economy.”"

Drive any distance anywhere in Zimbabwe beyond the upmarket Borrowdale neighbourhood in Harare, where Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace are detained in their sprawling mansion, and the scale of the challenges facing what was once one of the wealthiest countries in Africa is evident.
In the capital, the roads are potholed, outside they are cracked and crumbling. Banks are so short of cash that people wait hours to withdraw even tiny sums. The only jobs are in government service, yet salaries are rarely paid. The best and the brightest have long fled abroad. Warehouses are empty, fields lie fallow. The busiest store in rural villages is the “bottle shop”, selling dirt-cheap spirits.
Protesters in Zimbabwe call for Mugabe to step down – in pictures Read more
Zimbabwe has famously abundant natural resources but resuscitating the economy after 20 years of disastrous mismanagement and wholesale looting by corrupt officials is a major undertaking. The banking system needs to be rebooted, faith restored in the national currency and government finances somehow replenished. The vast debts incurred by Mugabe’s regime need to be rescheduled or waived and new funding arranged to rebuild the country’s shattered infrastructure.
Investors have long been interested in Zimbabwe but put off by the significant risk that any funds will be stolen or any successful venture appropriated. Can they now be sure that will not happen? Old habits die hard.
The ruling Zanu-PF party and allies in the military launched their takeover to purge an ambitious faction that threatened their position, not because they wanted to see structural reform that would shut down their own lucrative rackets and rent-seeking.

There are immediate practical problems, too. The police are seen as creatures of Mugabe by the military and allies, but someone needs to patrol the streets. There is the fate of Comrade Bob and Grace, when they are no longer president and first lady, to decide. There is a government to form, possible elections to hold.
It is this political process that poses the greatest challenge. The people of Zimbabwe have high hopes of a new democratic era. But the ousting of Mugabe was a redistribution of power within the ruling elite of Zimbabwe, not a people’s revolution.
Emmerson Mnangagwa, the ousted vice-president, who is most likely to succeed Mugabe when he finally leaves power, is no committed democrat. He was Mugabe’s chief enforcer, with a long history of human rights abuse. Mnangagwa, 75, will need to make some concessions to public opinion within Zimbabwe and the hopes of the international community, not least to get the donor and diaspora money the country so desperately needs. However, he will seek to do this while reinforcing, not weakening, the grip of the party.
But how long will Zimbabweans tolerate the rule of a clique of septuagenarian veterans of an armed struggle that took place before most of the population was born?
A similar question has been asked elsewhere in Africa over recent decades. It is being asked today in neighbouring South Africa, where the lustre of the African National Congress has steadily diminished over its 23 years in power.
The eventual demise of parties like Zanu-PF is inevitable. But so, too, is the trauma that accompanies their passing."
Robert Mugabe|The Observer|Zimbabwe|Africa|features,2017-11-18T20:33:15,guardian,Emma Graham-Harrison,Tens of thousands of jubilant citizens on the streets of Harare celebrate ‘this peaceful takeover’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/18/independence-day-zimbabwe-mugabe-harare,‘This is our second independence day - we want a new Zimbabwe’,en,world|africa,,"They came from all over Zimbabwe, streaming into the streets of Harare in a carnival of protest and celebration, determined to seal the peaceful but incontestable end of Robert Mugabe’s long rule.
Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans of every age, class, political persuasion and skin colour turned out, singing, chanting, dancing and sometimes crying, all exhilarated at the prospect of change, so fervently hoped for and until now so painfully elusive. Homeless squatters and street vendors marched beside wealthy entrepreneurs; Zanu-PF stalwarts and war veterans mixed with white farmers they had forced off their land.
“I can pretty much say this is our second independence day – we have waited for this a long time,” said Nyikayaramba, a 32-year-old IT worker. “We have suffered, and I praise God that this has finally happened. It’s a great time to be Zimbabwean.”
Zimbabwe: Mugabe's grip on power appears close to collapse Read more
The green, yellow, red and black of the national flag dotted the crowd, draped as capes, waved in the air, printed on clothes and painted on faces, on a day unmarred by violence. Others carried placards, a mix of blunt, funny, celebratory and obscene. “Mugabe must rest” placards included a picture of the nonagenarian snoozing; others played on his common nickname to declare “Bob’s not my uncle”. Those without flags or placards waved tree branches in celebration.
As they marched through town, tearing down mementos of Mugabe’s rule, from road signs to giant posters, each step made it clearer that his iron grip had finally loosened after nearly four decades, even if he had not yet been formally removed from office.
“We are making history today,” said Teclar Mazanhi, who was born in 1980, the year Mugabe came to power. “We want a new Zimbabwe.”
It had been a week of excitement and confusion, the oldest head of state in the world abruptly toppled, then reappearing smiling in photos with the military officers who had him under house arrest. Even more disconcertingly, he emerged to preside over a graduation ceremony on Friday as if nothing had changed.

The marches to demand his final removal from power were originally planned by the party machine of Mugabe’s own Zanu-PF, and veterans of the independence war. But they were taken over by ordinary Zimbabweans in a national outpouring of emotion.
“We are here to fight Mugabe. He must be gone today, not tomorrow,” said 28-year-old Clara Nkata, a street vendor who said she had never been to a rally before and didn’t belong to any political party.
For decades the country had inured itself to living under the control of one man, their leader defying the challenges of age and ambitious comrades to maintain control. Now power had been seized from him, it seemed as though the whole country was coming out to ensure he could not get it back.
“Mugabe must go, we are sick and tired,” said 49-year-old Elizabeth Muzadzi. “I couldn’t even go to my niece’s funeral last week because I didn’t have money for the bus.”
The unquestioned heroes of the day were the army, mobbed for selfies and handshakes as they watched the marchers from armoured personnel carriers and tanks, and celebrated in posters and placards for toppling Mugabe.
“With this peaceful takeover the army has given us our country back,” said Lizzy Dendamera, 34, surrounded by signs reading “Thank you ZDF [Zimbabwe Defence Forces]” and “Zimbabwe army: voice of the people”.
The crowd roared at the name of military chief and coup leader general Constantino Chiwenga, and helicopters buzzing above the crowd were greeted with ecstatic screams and whistles. Many years spent propping up Mugabe, often with extreme brutality, appeared to have been forgotten or forgiven.
It was a dramatic shift in status, and heavily-armed troops packed into a truck outside the main stages looked stiff and alarmed at the ecstatic crowd crushing towards them to say thank you. But, by turning on their commander-in-chief, they had unleashed years of pent-up hope. “We are so happy today, 100% happy,” said army wife Gladys Zimucha, at the march with friends because her husband was in barracks. “I am proud of him,” she added with a grin.
One of the most extraordinary aspects of Mugabe’s fall from grace has been how fast and completely the party that he controlled so tightly, for so long, has turned on him. “We were the ones who were with him in the bush, but now he is going astray,” said Ticho Njara, a 62-year-old war veteran and Zanu-PF member. “He better surrender his power today.”
Zimbabwe’s ruling party expected to sack Robert Mugabe on Sunday Read more
On the eve of the march, regional party offices around the country unleashed on Mugabe the formal ritual of party procedure that he had so often deployed against rivals. All united to call for his resignation and the return of former vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa, 75.
A ruthless former guerrilla fighter nicknamed “the crocodile”, Mnangagwa’s ousting from the party earlier this month set in motion the political showdown that ended in the coup. He is widely expected to take over from Mugabe as leader, perhaps as part of a unity coalition. “Mnangagwa must be the one who leads today,” said Njara.
Mnangagwa is not an obvious face of change, even if restrained by opposition politicians within some kind of unity government. A Zanu-PF stalwart who was Mugabe’s righthand man for decades, he is implicated in most of the corruption, violence and human rights abuses that tarnished the president’s reputation.
That history is as well known in Zimbabwe as Mugabe’s own. But after years of economic collapse and political ossification under a geriatric autocrat, huge numbers of Zimbabweans say they will embrace whatever alternative the army hammers out with Mugabe.
“Any change is good,” said Roderick Chamisa, 35, a manager from Harare. “Even if they take a drunk and put him there [as president], even a cockroach.”
There were solidarity protests in other Zimbabwean cities and beyond its borders, from South Africa to London. “Diaspora come back!” urged one poster aimed at millions scattered by the country’s economic decay.
The slow disintegration of a once-powerful economy, with industry and farming devastated by mismanagement, has left up to 90% of graduates from one of Africa’s best education systems jobless or forced into exile or casual labour.
“There aren’t enough jobs... we are here to say enough is enough,” said Kuda Masvaure, out with his brother Tinashe, both graduates and both unemployed. “A week ago our best dream was to leave the country to look for work.”
For poorer Zimbabweans, the failure of the economy has left them even more vulnerable. “I’m struggling, with no place to sleep. I am a squatter and I don’t even know what cash is these days,” said Shepherd Gonde, 42. “I want Mugabe to go.”

There was also an intoxicating sense of political freedom, after many years when opposing the president was dangerous or even deadly. People lined up to share their political views, and jostled to get their placards and banners into press photos or on TV. “A week ago we wouldn’t be doing this interview,” said Regis Fungurani, 31. “If we gave you our names or let you take our photo, Mugabe would have come for us, but now he is gone.”
Anchors at the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, known for stodgy propaganda, seemed overcome by genuine excitement. The state-controlled channel even broadcast a live speech by activist Evan Mawarire, a pastor who has been repeatedly arrested for challenging the government.
With airwaves and stages shared by politicians from the ruling party and their war veteran supporters, opposition figures and even activists, the march provided a moment of extraordinary national unity. Hatred of Mugabe and the damage he has done to Zimbabwe even brought together people who had been bitter enemies for years.

“This is the first march organised by the war vets that I have attended,” said Chris Shepherd, a former farmer and chairman of the national water polo team, out with his wife and family.
“You must remember they organised the marches that enabled the destruction of our property rights. It’s fantastic to be here, and I’m glad to be a part of it, but it’s difficult to process.”
That spirit of hope, and the new alliances, are likely to be strained by the political battles to come, and expectations are so high they are almost certain to be disappointed.
But in a country where for decades it has been dangerous to challenge the government, or even dream of hope, Zimbabweans were determined to celebrate the power of a peaceful population unleashed, and enjoy the chance, finally, to speak their minds.
“We are fully aware of the possible risks and pitfalls beyond this tipping point,” Zimbabwean newspaper publisher and entrepreneur Trevor Ncube said on Twitter. “We are confident we will be equal to the challenges. Yes, we remember Egypt too. After 37 years of repression, allow us to soak in this moment.”"

The presidential motorcade left Mugabe’s sprawling residence in Harare early on Saturday night, booed and jeered by marchers who had gathered outside.
Sources close to the military said the president had asked a Catholic priest and lifelong friend to act as an intermediary in ongoing talks with generals. Mugabe had previously rejected similar offers of mediation, suggesting that he was close to making a significant concession.
Few options are now open to the autocrat, who has ruled Zimbabwe through a mixture of coercion, bribery and revolutionary rhetoric for nearly four decades. Support in some branches of the security establishment, such as the police, has evaporated, and high-profile political supporters have been detained.
On Saturday, the streets of Harare were filled with joyous residents who chanted, sang and waved placards. Many embraced or posed for selfies with soldiers. The march had the approval of military authorities, and will boost the international image of the generals who seized power last week.
However, analysts said the celebrations were also evidence of a huge desire for democracy in Zimbabwe – not just the departure of the world’s oldest leader.
Piers Pigou, an expert with the International Crisis Group, said the march was both an opportunity and a major challenge for the military and the still-dominant Zanu-PF, which was Mugabe’s political vehicle.
“The language being used [by marchers] shows that people were out not just to support Zanu-PF and the army … What we have seen on the streets suggest that the ordinary Zimbabweans want an alternative to the centralising, controlling narrative,” said Pigou.
The military has said it has no intention of staying in power in and claimed that last week’s takeover was necessary to remove “criminals” close to the president, a reference to Grace Mugabe, the first lady, and her “G40” faction.
Most observers believe the former vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa is likely to take charge when Mugabe finally relinquishes power.
Mnangagwa, 75, is a former intelligence chief and veteran Zanu-PF official who was responsible for the repression of opposition parties in successive elections between 2000 and 2008. He was fired by Mugabe 10 days ago.
Opposition leaders in Zimbabwe have called for the formation of an inclusive transitional government but risk being sidelined by the powerful army and Zanu-PF.
There are also concerns that the military will maintain significant influence in the future. “The ruling party have allowed the military to taste political power [and] … we have to expect some role of the armed forces to continue for some time,” said Martin Rupiya, a former Zimbabwean army general.
One senior Zanu-PF official said fears of “praetorian politics” in coming years were justified.
Since taking power, the military has arrested about a dozen senior officials and ministers loyal to the first lady.
Mrs Mugabe, 52, has not been seen since the takeover. Sources told the Guardian she was in her husband’s Harare residence when he was detained on Tuesday and has not moved since.
Zanu-PF branches in all 10 provinces passed motions on Friday afternoon calling for Mugabe to be “recalled” as first secretary of the party. These will now be debated by the central committee of top leaders, which is due to meet at 10.30am local time on Sunday in Harare.
The motions also called for Mrs Mugabe to be stripped of her post as chair of the Zanu-PF women’s league. The first lady was a divisive figure who outraged many in Zimbabwe with her extravagance, violent outbursts and political ambitions.
Mugabe could theoretically continue as president even if he was no longer leader of Zanu-PF but this would be difficult in practice, party insiders said.
Relatives said the couple were “ready to die for what is correct” and had no intention of stepping down to legitimise this week’s military coup.
Speaking to Reuters from a secret location in South Africa, Patrick Zhuwao, Mugabe’s nephew, said on Saturday that his uncle had hardly slept since the military seized power, but his health was otherwise good.
The military takeover is thought to have been prompted in part by fears among the military and its allies within the ruling party of an imminent purge of rivals of Mrs Mugabe, which would allow her to exercise greater power.
Zimbabweans abroad also demonstrated against their president on Saturday. Hundreds living in Britain gathered outside the country’s embassy in central London calling on Mugabe to step aside. Similar rallies were held in South Africa and Namibia.
Mugabe’s downfall is likely to send shockwaves across Africa, where a number of entrenched autocratic leaders, from Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni to Democratic Republic of Congo’s Joseph Kabila, are facing mounting pressure to step aside.
The failure of regional powers, especially South Africa, to explicitly support the military intervention has angered many in Zimbabwe.
Jacob Zuma, the South African president, said on Saturday the African region was committed to supporting “the people of Zimbabwe” after a military takeover and that he was cautiously optimistic that the situation there could be resolved amicably.
For some in Africa, Mugabe remains a nationalist hero, the continent’s last independence leader and a symbol of its struggle to throw off the legacy of decades of colonial subjugation. But to many more, he is reviled as a dictator who betrayed the values of the liberation struggle."

As Americans prepare to cast the first votes of the 2016 election race, at a glance, here is what is at stake for the three Democratic and 11 Republican hopefuls.
Hillary Clinton
Lost the state in 2008 to an outsider called Barack Obama. Needs to stop the same happening again with Sanders to reassure nervous Democratic leaders.
Bernie Sanders
If the revolution starts anywhere, it needs to start here. A win could snowball, a heavy loss would be a buzzkill for the democratic socialist from Vermont.
Martin O’Malley
The former Maryland governor is likely to struggle to reach the 15% threshold in many Democratic precincts. Wipeout may spell lights out.
Donald Trump
New York’s bombastic billionaire is looking less confident after a no-show debate drama. Needs to win here to maintain an aura of impregnability.
Ted Cruz
Tarnished by failing to unequivocally back Iowa’s corn ethanol industry and by Canada “birther” distractions. A win or close second would banish doubts for the maverick from Texas and put him back on track to catch Trump.
Marco Rubio
Iowa is alien territory to the establishment’s best hope, but the Florida senator’s new evangelical-tailored message is gaining traction and should deliver him third place.
Ben Carson
The retired neurosurgeon is currently crashing from a brief polling high last November. He could disappear for good in Iowa but is likely to soldier on in hope of recapturing that brief momentum.
Rand Paul
A one-time darling of the libertarian right, the Kentucky senator is staging a late recovery in Iowa. Fourth place could save his campaign (for now).
Jeb Bush
The former frontrunner is banking on New Hampshire to salvage what is left of his campaign. Iowa threatens to be a disaster, but expectations are at least suitably low.
Chris Christie
Likewise, the New Jersey governor is more at home on the east coast, but even a handful of Iowan votes will be helpful when it comes to staging the establishment fightback in New Hampshire.
Mike Huckabee
If the conservative former governor of Arkansas still means anything, it is to the evangelicals of Iowa who helped him win the state in 2008. A dismal showing here means it is time to go home.
John Kasich
As the designated grownup in the Republican establishment, the Ohio governor is pinning his hopes on breakthrough in New Hampshire not Iowa.
Carly Fiorina
The former CEO of Hewlett Packard is a long way from her comfort zone out here in the prairies. She is barely registering but will probably hold on for the next battle.
Rick Santorum
Like Huckabee, the former Pennsylvania senator and social conservative is only competing in 2016 because he won Iowa before, in 2012. Heavy defeat here this time will have him packing his bags for good."

The attacks were claimed by Islamic State (Isis).
Syrian state media said the first blast was caused by a car bomb and then two suicide bombers blew themselves up near the revered Sayyida Zeinab mosque in the south of the capital, a site of pilgrimage for Shia Muslims from Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and elsewhere. Broadcasts from the scene showed footage of burning buildings, a huge crater in the road, and charred and wrecked vehicles.
“Two soldiers of the caliphate carried out martyrdom operations in a den of the infidels in the Sayyida Zeinab area, killing nearly 50 and injuring around 120,” Isis said in a statement circulated on social media.

It was one of the worst attacks in a government-controlled area of Damascus and one where there has been a strong presence of Hezbollah and other Shia militia forces in recent months. It served as another vicious and bloody reminder of what is at stake in the Geneva talks, which are yet to produce anything more than anodyne statements by both parties.
Airstrikes by both Syrian and Russian warplanes have continued unabated, as have sieges of 15 areas where hundreds of thousands of people are living in rapidly deteriorating conditions. The opposition Syrian national coalition said on Sunday that 34 civilians, including three women and six children, had been killed since the Swiss talks formally opened last Friday – a week after the talks were originally scheduled.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy for Syria, paid a “courtesy call” to opposition negotiators on Sunday, who insisted they will not enter into negotiations of any kind until the implementation of a UN security council resolution demanding that all parties allow aid access, release detainees, end sieges and stop targeting civilian areas.
De Mistura is to meet each delegation separately on Monday for what the UN calls “proximity talks” and then shuttle between them, since there is not enough common ground between them to meet without immediate collapse. Last time talks were held in Geneva, two years ago, the Syrian parties exchanged insults and the negotiations broke up without result. It will clearly be a difficult process.

“We only came to Geneva after receiving assurances and commitments,” Basma Kodmani, an opposition negotiator, told reporters. “And we have precise commitments on the fact there would be serious progress on the humanitarian situation. We can’t start political negotiations until we have those gestures [in place].” The opposition’s hope is the release of prisoners held by the government will be enough to unblock the impasse.

But Bashar al-Jaafari, Syria’s UN ambassador and the head of the Syrian government team, said the opposition was “not serious” about wanting peace. Damascus has consistently dismissed its opponents as “terrorists” and insists that two anti-Assad rebel groups – the Islamist Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam – be barred from talks and proscribed, along with Isis and Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaida’s Syrian affiliate. “We will never sit down directly with terrorists nor have dialogue with them,” said Omran al-Zoubi, the Syrian minister of information.
The US, Britain, France and Saudi Arabia are working hard to ensure that the talks do go ahead, and are supporting the opposition closely. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, angered the Syrian negotiators in a stormy meeting in Riyadh last week but then persuaded them to overcome their reservations and attend the talks, which he described as “a pivotal phase” in international efforts to curb violence in Syria.

“I appeal to both sides to make the most of this moment, to seize the opportunity for serious negotiations, to negotiate in good faith with the goal of making concrete, measurable progress,” Kerry he said in a statement on Sunday. Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, said pointedly his country would continue to back the anti-Assad rebels whatever happened in Geneva. Many anti-Assad Syrians mistrust the US and believe it has moved too close to Russia’s position.

De Mistura is planning six months of talks, first seeking a ceasefire and later working toward a political settlement to a war that has killed more than 250,000 people, driven more than 10 million from their homes and drawn in regional and global powers since it began nearly five years ago. They key issue remains a political transition and Assad’s own future – though how that will be addressed remains unclear.
International attention will be focused on Syria again later this week when world leaders meet in London for the Supporting Syria and the Region conference 2016. Efforts to mitigate the effects of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis look likely to proceed more rapidly than the Geneva talks."

A blond-haired Frenchman has appeared in the latest Islamic State video threatening new terrorist attacks in the west.
The man, whose eyes are uncovered but whose features and hair can be seen through a pale balaclava, is then shown shooting in the head a man accused of being a spy. Four other Isis jihadis each shoot another prisoner. The Frenchman is dressed in camouflage fatigues and the others are in black.

He talks in French of the enemies of Isis and tells them to expect something that will “make them forget September 11 and Paris”. He also speaks of Spain and Portugal and states that Isis is seeking the return of Al-Andalus – the name of the Iberian peninsula dominated by Muslims between the 8th and 15th centuries – and the cities of Toledo and Cordoba.
The eight-minute video, thought to have been filmed in northern Iraq, showed the five prisoners speaking in Arabic.
The terrorist in the film is not the first presumed French convert to feature in Isis propaganda. In 2014, Maxime Hauchard, a French citizen from Normandy who converted to Islam at the age of 17 and then became radicalised, was identified from a video showing the remains of the American hostage Peter Kassig.
France is still reeling from the fact that most of those who perpetrated terrorist attacks in the country last year – including the series of attacks in January 2015 on the satirical publication Charlie Hebdo and the November shootings and suicide bombings – were French citizens."

Vic Reeves was back in the city where he was born, as James Moir, in 1959, while Bob Mortimer is also a Yorkshireman, from Middlesbrough.
In another sense, though, this is a new beginning. The full title of the show is 25 Years of R & M – The Poignant Moments, and one poignancy is that the programmes for the opening night bore the date 2015, presumably printed before the original dates were cancelled last year for Mortimer to undergo emergency triple-bypass heart surgery.

There’s a sense on stage that this medical near-miss has deepened the already touching affinity between the performers, as well as giving them another link with Morecambe & Wise, the duo whom they have always shadowed physically and psychologically. (Reeves played Eric’s dad in a TV bio-drama.)
Although, in this case, it’s the short one, rather than the tall bespectacled one, who had the cardiac problems, the show begins with the pair echoing the sort of jokes that Morecambe made, on returning to performance after surgery, about his chances of getting through the show. At intervals Mortimer shouts out his pulse rate from a sports watch with scores – “116!”, “127!” – which, if he wasn’t exaggerating for humorous effect, will hopefully slow down after the fright of first night.
A gag involving Mortimer wearing a wig, as Ernie Wise was accused of doing, plus a spin on a famous M & W joke about Jamaica, add to the frequent feeling that we are watching an anthology of comedy references. Reeves is the only British comedian apart from Python’s Terry Gilliam who guarantees the audience a high-class modern art show in passing, through his paintings and montages, both in back projections and a souvenir programme that is, for once, worth purchasing.
Less happily, the character of a Japanese plastic surgeon who struggles with English pronunciation – his attempt to say “knowledge” misheard as “Norwich” – feels like a gruesome channeling of the grimmest bits of Benny Hill.
Like the recent Monty Python gigs, the show has the feel of a reunion of ageing fans with old jokes. In comedy’s equivalent of singing along with the hits at a rock gig, parts of the crowd join in with the catchphrases as the pair stage favourites from their screen days such as the talent show Novelty Island and the popular justice show, Judge Nutmeg, enjoyably silly spoofs of the sort of TV that is possibly stupid enough to begin with.
Those who haven’t binged on a box set before arriving may have less fun. Looking impressively fit and vigorous, Mortimer is a fantastic advert for his surgeon, but the show looks in need of some cutting and stitching as the UK tour proceeds over the next few weeks.
Although as trim as Mortimer’s post-operative frame (at barely two hours including interval), the premiere performance sometimes dragged and meandered even more than might be expected from the duo’s always-delicate balance between discipline and improvisation. In the end, enjoyment will depend on whether you find inspired or infantile the idea of lard being squeezed through the eye-holes in a photo of Benedict Cumberbatch."

A British pilot who was shot dead by an elephant poaching gang manoeuvred his helicopter to save his colleague’s life before he collapsed and died, according to reports.
Roger Gower died while tracking poachers in the Maswa game reserve in the north of the country. Officials said his helicopter crashed after being hit by rounds from an AK-47 rifle fired from the ground on Friday.
Gower, 37, and a safari guide, Nicky Bester, were flying low to the ground searching for gunmen who had killed three elephants in the reserve when the gang broke cover and shot at them from the ground with the automatic rifle. A bullet is understood to have passed through the floor of the helicopter, hitting Gower first in the leg then in the shoulder before exiting through the roof.
Despite his injuries Gower managed to fly the helicopter down into a tree preventing a potential explosion and saving Bester, who jumped to safety as the aircraft came down and hid from the poachers in a thicket, wildlife authorities said.
Photographs of the crashed helicopter showed apparent bullet holes in the fuselage. A spokesman from Tanzania National Parks, Pascal Shelutete, said: “Three elephant carcasses that were found indicated that whoever shot the chopper down was on a serious illegal hunting spree.” He added that poachers can be “heavily armed with sophisticated military weaponry”.
Three men have been arrested by Tanzanian police. The natural resources and tourism minister, Jumanne Maghembe, said: “The suspects are in the hands of police. They are cooperating, and soon more people making up the poaching gang will be netted and brought to justice.”
The mission had been a collaboration between the Friedkin Conservation Fund and the Tanzanian government, which has struggled to respond to an explosion of “industrial-scale poaching” in recent years.
Dan Friedkin, the chairman of the Friedkin Conservation Fund, said Gower had been engaged in a joint mission with Tanzanian officials to catch elephant poachers.
He said: “Roger was killed while piloting a helicopter during a coordinated effort with the Tanzanian wildlife authorities to track down and arrest active elephant poachers. In the course of this action, the poachers fired upon the helicopter and Roger was fatally wounded.”
Pratik Patel, a close friend working on the same anti-poaching operation, told BBC Radio 5: “They did see ... two [elephant] carcasses. While he was looking for the poachers, he heard gunshots and moved to the area and saw a fresh carcass, the third elephant that had just gone down within 24 hours.
“I guess the poachers heard the helicopters searching and tried to make away with the ivory and hide. When Roger came across the carcasses, he hovered over them and moved forward to search the area. What he saw was evidence of ivory and turned the helicopter to come back to the spot.
“At that point, one of the poachers sneaked out of the bushes and shot Roger, forcing the helicopter to hit the ground really hard. The bullet that hit Roger cut through the floor of the helicopter, through his leg, part of his body and shoulder and hit his face, before going through the roof of the helicopter. It was from a heavy calibre gun – probably the same gun that they used to kill the elephant.”
He paid tribute to “a great guy, a great friend, a great pilot” who he said loved working with Tanzania’s wildlife: “Roger was an amazing person, an amazing character, full of joy, full of life. He loved Africa, he loved Tanzania and he loved being in the bush.”
Andy Payne, Gower’s colleague and housemate, described him as a “respected and professional pilot” who was becoming increasingly invested in working to stop the “wanton killing” of Tanzania’s elephants.
Gower and Bester had been sent to track the poachers after reports came in about shots heard in the bush about 12 miles (19km) from their base.
Payne told the Telegraph: “Roger was injured but thankfully he was flying low and slow and under the circumstances, he did a fantastic job of putting the helicopter down in a way that his colleague was able to walk away with minor injuries. It was a hard landing but he managed to roll it on to its side.”
Although the aircraft was deep in the bush, Bester had a satellite phone, a radio and GPS and was able to call for help and was taken to hospital. Gower could not be saved.
Payne said Gower had always been safety-conscious. “He always erred on the side of caution, would pay attention to aviation accident reports and we would discuss them to ensure we would never fall into those traps,” he said.
Payne added that he, Gower and Bester shared a house near their base in Arusha. He said Bester was “obviously very shaken up but recovering well physically”.
“He has some non-life threatening injuries from the heavy landing but it could have been much worse,” he said. “He and Roger worked together a lot, all three of us have been friends from before Roger joined us last year but it was the first time we’d all worked together and it was great.”
Meanwhile Lazaro Nyalandu, a former minister of tourism and natural resources, wrote on Twitter that Gower was killed by AK-47 assault rifle fire. Paying tribute, he tweeted: “You loved our country and I knew you on many flights we took together in defence of our wildlife heritage. Life is precious.
“Those poachers who killed Capt Roger are coward, evil, and sad people. A fine hearted individual gone too soon, and our hearts are broken. Capt Roger’s body was flown into Arusha early today, as those who killed him are still at large. Everything must [be] done to bring them to justice.”
The Foreign Office confirmed it is providing support to the victim’s family.
Gower trained as an accountant in London and became a helicopter pilot in 2004. Before working in Tanzania, he flew from neighbouring Kenya, working for safaris and excursions.
He was understood to have attended the prestigious Hallfield independent school in Edgbaston, while his family had ties to Edgbaston Golf Club.
Gower was reportedly the youngest son of David Gower, a former partner of Birmingham-based law firm Pinsents. His parents were due to arrive in Tanzania this weekend to meet his colleagues and find out more from police about what happened. Meanwhile his friends and family posted tributes on social media using the hashtag #flyhighcaptainroger.
Jo South, Gower’s cousin, wrote: “My amazing cousin, forever in our hearts. So very proud. In memory of my cousin who was tragically killed by poachers please help me spread the word and put an end to this.”
Sandra Velarde, an ecologist working in the region, wrote: “Sad. Roger Gowler was murdered by poachers in Tanzania. Your cheekiness will be missed.”
A census in June found that the elephant population in Tanzania, which depends heavily on the safari tourism industry, declined from 110,000 in 2009 to about 43,000 in 2014.
Demand for ivory from fast-growing Asian economies such as China and Vietnam, where it is turned into jewellery and ornaments, has led to a rise in poaching across sub-Saharan Africa.
Tanzanian authorities said they had made progress over the past few months in their crackdown on illegal poaching. Last October, charges were brought against a prominent Chinese businesswoman, Yang Feng Glan, 66, who was dubbed the “Ivory Queen” for running a network that smuggled out hundreds of tusks.
Gower’s brother Max has set up a fundraising page in the pilot’s memory with the aim of raising £50,000 for anti-poaching efforts in Tanzania. “Some good should come out of Roger’s tragic death,” he wrote on the JustGiving site. Donations can be made here."

A row between one of Britain’s most prestigious golf clubs and its members has escalated with the owners being threatened with legal action over plans to dramatically increase annual fees.
Members of Wentworth golf club have accused the Chinese-based owners of using an eye-watering rise in membership rates to get rid of them and turn the club into a preserve of the ultra-rich.
The dispute at the Surrey club has caused diplomatic ripples, with interventions from the foreign secretary, who represents the local area in parliament, and even from the Chinese embassy in London.
Now Reignwood, the Chinese conglomerate that bought the club for £135m in 2014, has been sent a 15-page letter by some members threatening legal action.
Fenced off: how London’s super-rich are destroying the soul of their community Read more
After acquisition of the club from fashion industry entrepreneur and restaurateur Richard Caring, the new owners mooted a number of changes. They proposed to reduce the number of members from 4,000 to 800 and those invited to rejoin the club would be charged a one-off payment of £100,000 while annual fees would rise from £8,000 to £16,000.
In the legal letter sent last week, Wentworth’s new owners were given an ultimatum to back down or face court action. The letter claims the planned changes to the club’s membership would breach a legal trust agreement in place for 50 years, contravene consumer and equality laws, and possibly even break Chinese laws on joining golf clubs.
“The proposed membership structure will fundamentally change the nature and character of the club and the Wentworth estate and is unacceptable. It must cease,” states the members’ letter.
The golf club, one of the most famous in the world, is at the heart of a private estate in Virginia Water surrounded by multi-million-pound houses built in the 1920s. Club members reportedly include Sir Bruce Forsyth and Sir Michael Parkinson.
Nigel Moss, who is leading the campaign against the changes, said: “Reignwood hasn’t listened and is simply trying to ride roughshod over the Wentworth community.”
Hostilities broke out after Caring sold the club to Reignwood – which is owned by Chanchai Ruayrungruang, a Thai billionaire based in Beijing – in 2014.
Members have clubbed together to form a legal fighting fund and employed a specialist litigation practice to resist the changes. The law firm claims the reforms breach a 50-year-old trust document, said to guarantee the character of the club. It also argues that estate residents’ rights of access and membership of the club would be threatened by the “prohibitively expensive joining fee”.
The £100,000 sum is described as “a patently unfair charge, whose purpose and effect appears to be to exclude the majority of the current members”.
The letter continues: “The club will, if the proposed membership structure is implemented, become the preserve of a small number of extremely high net worth individuals and lose its role at the heart of the vibrant community of the Wentworth estate.”
Lawyers also argue that the proposed “exclusive membership” could be in breach of Chinese law. Campaigners have claimed that such practices are forbidden in China. The Chinese Communist party banned its 88 million members from joining golf clubs in October last year.
Eric Leon, chairman of the Wentworth residents’ association, said: “It is an absolute tragedy that the situation remains so antagonistic when a fair and reasonable solution could easily have been found. Reignwood appears intent on clearing out the membership, restricting accessibility to the club and thereby changing the character of a great golfing institution.”
A club spokesman said: “Wentworth Club has undertaken an extensive legal review of the proposed membership structure, together with various legal and professional advisers, including seeking the opinion of Queen’s Counsel, which has confirmed that based on the available evidence it is able to proceed with the revised structure.”
Earlier this month, the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, writing in his capacity as the area’s MP, described Reignwood’s plans as ”very disappointing” in a letter to a club member. Hammond has met Wentworth members and representatives of Reignwood in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
Home to three 18-hole courses and a striking crenellated clubhouse, and with about 4,500 members, Wentworth is famed throughout the golfing world for an old association with the Ryder Cup and as the venue for the annual BMW PGA Championship on the European Tour."

Official Ofsted figures, obtained by Tracy Brabin, the shadow minister for early years, show there has been a net loss of 1,146 nurseries and childminders from the Early Years Register since 2015. In total, 15,288 childcare providers have left the register, while only 14,142 have joined. Four-fifths (81%) of those who left the register had been rated either good or outstanding by Ofsted.
“The Tories promised to be the most family-friendly government ever, but time and again they are failing working families,” said Brabin. “Ministers ask early-years providers to do more and more but refuse to give them the necessary funding. If they were serious about giving every child the best start in life, they would give providers the resources they need, instead of managing the decline of the sector, content to see thousands of providers lost year after year.”
Brabin was alarmed that so many of the providers leaving the register were rated good or outstanding. “We need to do more to encourage those that are known to deliver to stay in the sector. The loss of over 1,100 providers since May 2015 is a sign of a system in crisis.”
Childcare crisis takes more than a financial toll | Barbara Ellen Read more
Brabin has repeatedly criticised the government for underfunding the so-called “free” scheme, which entitles the parents of three- and four-year-old children to 30 hours of childcare during term time, (equivalent to 38 weeks) if both work and each earns less than £100,000.
The Pre-School Learning Alliance and the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years say local authorities typically pay nurseries and childminders just £4.27 an hour to provide the “free” hours to parents, leaving nurseries facing an average 18% annual shortfall in funds, and the average childminder out of pocket by more than £410 per child per year.
As a result, 94% of nurseries and childminders have been unable to offer the 30 hours entirely for free, according to a recent survey of 730 childcare providers by the Champagne Nurseries on Lemonade Funding group. Similar research published in Nursery World reveals some nurseries have come up with “unethical” ways to pass the cost of providing the scheme back on to parents.
Sanjay Morzaria, who runs Little Darling Childcare in Harrow, faces a £14.60 daily shortfall in funding from his local authority for each 30-hour place he provides but, under the rules of the scheme, he is not allowed to openly charge parents a compulsory top-up fee to make up the difference. He thinks this is unfair: “I’ve had to think in a very deceitful way to find a way around a government policy that would hurt my business.”
He has started charging parents of children who are eligible for 30 hours of government-funded childcare £15 a day for lunch. These parents can opt instead to take their child home for the lunch hour, but they must arrive dead on time each lunchtime or pay a £7.50 penalty for every five minutes they are early or late for pick up and drop off.
“The contract was drawn up by one of our parents, who is a senior partner in an international law firm,” says Morzaria. Parents who do not qualify for the 30-hour scheme are offered a different contract with no lunch fees or late penalties to pay. “It’s unethical and totally unfair but I don’t have a choice. Either I do this or I say sorry, I’m not having your child because I can’t afford it – or I accept the child and I go bankrupt.”
Parents whose children are eligible for the 30-hour scheme pay a new charge of £40 a day to cover the cost of lunch and extracurricular activities at the Abacus Ark chain of nurseries in London. “We have to do what we’re doing because we’d shut down otherwise,” said owner Anthony Ioannou. Parents who do not agree to pay the voluntary contribution are not offered places at his nurseries. “Ethically, it doesn’t feel right. I’m being asked to lie to parents. I wish the government would stop saying the 30 hours are free, because they’re not.”
The sector has written an open letter to chancellor Philip Hammond before the budget on Wednesday pleading for the government to increase its funding of childcare and warning that the situation is about to reach a crisis point. Nearly 38% of childcare providers surveyed by the Pre-School Learning Alliance think their businesses will no longer be sustainable at the end of this academic year.
Children and families minister Robert Goodwill said: “We are determined to support as many families as possible with access to high-quality, affordable childcare, and earlier this year we fulfilled our promise to double the free childcare available to working parents to 30 hours a week, saving them up to £5,000 a year per child. Hundreds of thousands of hardworking families are already benefiting from that offer.”"
