They said \u201cIt is clear that Oriel has been influenced significantly by the threats of donors keen to maintain symbols of Cecil Rhodes.\u201d\nElla Jeffreys, a master\u2019s student, told the Guardian: \u201cWe feel that the decision of Oriel College, due to the threat of withdrawing funding by alumni, shows that money talks over students.\n\u201cWithout any proper understanding they are whitewashing a serious and real history that still affects people today.\u201d\nThe campaign said in a statement: \u201cOriel has been rushed into this decision by the irresponsible threats of wealthy individuals. This is a decision for the short term. It is a decision made by authorities, not by students. It is a decision motivated by power not by principle.\u201d\nThe Guardian view on Cecil Rhodes\u2019s legacy: the empire strikes back \u2013 good | Editorial Read more\nThe statement said the decision lacked \u201clegitimacy\u201d and warned: \u201cIt is a decision that jeopardises trust between students and the institution.\u201d\nOriel College said last week that it would not remove the statue of Rhodes despite a campaign by students that has gained much media attention. The campaigners believe the British imperialist\u2019s legacy should not be celebrated.\nLast week Oriel said: \u201cFollowing careful consideration, the college\u2019s governing body has decided that the statue should remain in place and that the college will seek to provide a clear historical context to explain why it is there.\u201d\nIt confirmed it had been warned of the possibility that it would lose about \u00a3100m in gifts should the statue be taken down. However, a spokesman insisted the financial implications were not the primary consideration.\nStudent activists said they would not be derailed by interventions such as those of Chris Patten, the chancellor of the university, who said in a recent interview that those involved with Rhodes Must Fall should \u201cthink about being educated elsewhere\u201d.\nThey said at a packed press conference: \u201cHis intervention shows that it is the chancellor that is most concerned about avoiding uncomfortable debates and challenging discussions.\n\u201cOur campaign has never been about safe spaces. But the chancellor is clearly keen to carve out a safe space of his own, where debates about colonialism can be silenced and swept under the carpet.\u201d\nAisha S Gani (@aishagani) At the Rhodes Must Fall campaign press conference at Oxford pic.twitter.com/3VQbFqsDpf\nCampaigners released seven demands on Monday and said the debate was not just about the statue of Rhodes but also about the representation of students and academics and curriculum change, as well as iconography.\nStudents called for a reckoning from the institution, and said their first demand was for Oxford to \u201cacknowledge and confront its role in the ongoing physical and ideological violence of empire\u201d. They want the university to apologise for its role and to offer more scholarships to black students from southern Africa.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Athinangamso Nkopo from the Rhodes Must Fall campaign. Photograph: John Stillwell/PA\nCampaigners also called for a commitment to recontextualising iconography and said: \u201cMurderous colonists and slaveholders belong in books and museums, not on the side of buildings.\u201d\nThey said they wanted to hear \u201cthe voices suffocated into silence by a Eurocentric academy\u201d. They demanded a decolonised curriculum, as well as blind-marked applications and implicit bias training for all academic staff.\nThe campaigners called for an immediate end to \u201coutright racism\u201d at campus and also demanded the university \u201ctake responsibility for the culture it perpetuates\u201d and to ensure the work of anti-racist students and staff was properly recognised and institutionalised.\nSimukai Chigudu, a postgraduate student in international development, said Oriel\u2019s decision \u201cthrows into sharp relief that strong power donors have in shaping the college and underscores that it is not a free, open and democratic [process].\n\u201cThe key is to undergo the democratic and egalitarian process of canvassing opinion and ideas, and that is where the campaign needs to go.\nThere is a profound attachment and misunderstanding on the legacy of imperialism.\nHe added: \u201cThe university does not take the views seriously of students prepared to put themselves on the front line. Oriel and the chancellor [have shown] a dereliction of duty.\u201d\nRhodes attended Oriel College in the 1870s before returning to South Africa. It was there that he founded the De Beers diamond empire. He became one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men and rose to be premier of the then Cape Colony in 1890.\nHe is now chiefly remembered for beginning the policy of enforced racial segregation in South Africa and for his belief in the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T14:41:10", "author": "Aisha Gani|Jonathan Jones|Yussef Robinson|Timothy Garton Ash", "lang": "en", "topic": "University of Oxford|Higher education|Oxford|news", "category": "UK|education", "title": "Campaigners condemn Oxford college for keeping Rhodes statue", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Activists pushing for removal of statue of 19th-century imperialist say Oriel College has \u2018sold out\u2019 to donors"},
{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/01/schools-teachers-classroom-crisis-stress-grind", "content": "British schools are reporting a classroom crisis, with thousands of disaffected teachers leaving the profession, and new graduates discouraged from training because of the daily stress and grind. And with the number of state school pupils set to rise by a million by 2022, the problem is only getting worse\nJacquie Sainsbury left secondary school in Canvey Island, Essex around 30 years ago with one O-level. She had five kids before deciding to train as a teacher. In 2000, she left Derby University with a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE), and nine years later, she became the head of Brookhill Leys primary school in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire. I meet her there on a Monday afternoon: she and her deputy show me round before we sit down in her office and unpick exactly what it takes to make a success of a 430-pupil school in what she describes as \u201ca very tough area\u201d.\nEastwood sits in the heart of what used to be the Nottinghamshire coalfield. The last pit here closed in 1985, and the scars have yet to heal. \u201cWe\u2019re in the bottom 20% of the deprivation indicators in the country,\u201d Sainsbury tells me. \u201cA lot of poverty.\u201d She and her staff have to cope with regular challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for our teachers to be shouted at by parents; to have to deal with drunk parents,\u201d she says. \u201cThe things that our staff have to deal with, you don\u2019t have to deal with in an everyday walk of life. We\u2019ve got fantastic parents, and we\u2019ve got parents who need a lot of help.\u201d\nBrookhill Leys, it has to be said, does not feel like a \u201cproblem\u201d school. Just over 45% of the children receive free school meals, compared with a national average of 16%; around a third are understood to have special educational needs of some kind. But walking around its airy, ordered classrooms, and watching everything from instruction in charcoal drawing to an avoidant 10-year-old who has just exited his classroom agree to make amends and go back in, the sense of something quietly remarkable is obvious. A good school is something you can sense inside five minutes. And this is one \u2013 with, for what it\u2019s worth, a \u201cgood\u201d rating from the school inspectorate Ofsted to match.\nIt\u2019s not unusual for our teachers to have to deal with drunk parents\nBut for Sainsbury and her colleagues, things are getting harder, in the midst of what repeated headlines bluntly describe as a teacher shortage. When Sainsbury used to advertise a job vacancy, she got around 25 applications, which would then be whittled down to a shortlist of five. \u201cNow we\u2019re lucky if we get five applications,\u201d she says. \u201cA teacher needs to suit a school. Sometimes, we can get a teacher in, and think, \u2018They\u2019re really going to struggle here.\u2019 But then you\u2019ll get another one and think: \u2018Yep \u2013 they\u2019re going to fit in.\u2019 We don\u2019t get that choice at the moment.\u201d Last year, she advertised for a teacher and received just one application \u2013 at which point, she decided to fill the gap with a young trainee.\nWhile the level of new applicants shrinks, increasing numbers of teachers are getting out. Over the last four years, around eight teachers have left Brookhill Leys: more than double the number Sainsbury would normally expect. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one at the moment who started in September at management level, and she\u2019s just decided she doesn\u2019t want to be a teacher any more. She says that compared with the school she worked at in London, her workload here is better. But she\u2019s had enough of it.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pupils at Brookhill Leys Primary School, Eastwood, Notts. Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian\nSome of the factors behind stories like these are traceable to the New Labour years, but many are rooted in Michael Gove\u2019s hyperactive four-year reign as education secretary. They go from never-ending paperwork, to a constantly changing regime of exams and assessments. Meanwhile, the prospect of a visit from Ofsted and the possibility of a bad inspection are a constant source of stress \u2013 not least because a \u201crequires improvement\u201d or the dread \u201cinadequate\u201d rating will mean even more upheaval.\nOn top of all that are the effects of the pay policy which froze teachers salaries for three years from 2010, and recently capped rises for most teachers at 1% until 2020. As any maths teacher could tell you, that means pay cuts in real terms \u2013 and more disaffection, as wages in the private sector start ticking up.\nTeacher recruitment \u2018a mess\u2019 as every school slugs it out for itself Read more\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that a lot of headteachers aren\u2019t even bothering to advertise jobs any more,\u201d Sainsbury says. \u201cThere\u2019s a round-robin email that gets circulated, and a head will say, \u2018Does anyone know of a teacher who\u2019s available for September?\u2019 No one will give an answer, but you\u2019ll get four or five others who jump in on the back of it, going, \u2018I\u2019m looking for someone, too.\u2019 I\u2019ve never seen that before. Schools are desperate. They\u2019re getting to the end of term, and they haven\u2019t got anybody.\nWhat is happening at Brookhill Leys is only one small part of a snowballing national story. The government insists that across England, teacher numbers and vacancy rates remain relatively stable, but even the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, acknowledges that there are some problems. Moreover, things look set to get worse. In 2022, the number of children in state schools will stand at just over eight million compared with seven million today.\nAt the last count, the number of temporarily filled teacher posts stood at 3,210, up from 2,300 the year before. The number of teachers working without a formal teaching qualification \u2013 which, let\u2019s not forget, is allowed in academies and free schools \u2013 was just over 20,000, up from 16,600. The government\u2019s own research shows that in the 12 months to November 2014, the state sector lost nearly 50,000 teachers \u2013 representing the highest rate of exit for 10 years and an increase of more than 25% over five years. More sobering still, 100,000 qualified teachers have opted never to work in a classroom at all.\n\u2018Criminalised\u2019 as a failing school \u2013 in the midst of Oxford\u2019s wealthy spires Read more\nIn 2015, the number of graduates entering teacher training did go up \u2013 but it had fallen by a total of 14% over the previous four years. Among new trainee teachers, subjects such as physics and design and technology (or D&T) remain massively under-subscribed. The number of trainee teachers based in universities or colleges is falling, in keeping with the government\u2019s controversial push to place aspiring teachers with schools, rather than higher education institutions. And here too, there are problems: the main programme aimed at training teachers that way is called School Direct, and it seems to have had consistent issues with a lack of take-up: in 2015, only 54% of the places set aside for new graduates were filled. (A DfE spokesperson says that the government has purposely over-inflated such target figures to signal their ambitions for the policy, and \u201cjust because we don\u2019t hit that target, it doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s a shortage.\u201d)\nA recent survey by the National Association of Headteachers found that 59% of schools advertising for staff had \u201cstruggled\u201d to recruit, and 20% had failed completely. In London and the home counties, there seem to be acute problems caused by soaring house prices: one north London headteacher recently told me that some of his staff commute 50 miles. But judging by rising noise from schools all over England, the truth is that the teacher crisis is starting to hit pretty much everywhere, and affecting every level of the profession. Two weeks ago, the education charity the Future Leaders Trust added to the angst surrounding teaching with a report warning that schools were finding it increasingly hard to recruit headteachers, and that 28% of current heads had told one survey they were planning to leave their jobs within five years.\nThe DfE\u2019s response to all this has a slightly conflicted tone. It insists that \u201cteaching has a lower turnover rate than the economy as a whole\u201d, and that \u201c90% of teachers in state schools stay in the profession from one year to the next\u201d. Talk of a crisis, it says, is \u201cdisingenuous and misleading\u201d, and it goes on to bemoan \u201cscaremongering\u201d. But the DfE apparently does \u201crecognise the challenges that some school leaders face in particular areas\u201d \u2013 and says it has increased bursaries and scholarships to try to attract recruits in \u201cpriority subjects\u201d, as well as creating the National Teaching Service: a new scheme aimed at sending 1,500 teachers and \u201cmiddle leaders\u201d to schools deemed \u201cunderperforming\u201d by 2020.1\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Education secretary Nicky Morgan. Photograph: Mark Thomas/REX/Shutterstock\nThe central problem, though, is that nothing the government has proposed so far has allayed rising fears of the teacher shortage turning critical very soon \u2013 not on the part of political mischief-makers, but people who work in schools all over the country.\nThe same day I meet Jacquie Sainsbury, I speak to two ex-teachers. Nicola Deegan worked for 11 years as a French and Spanish teacher in the hard-pressed Merseyside suburb of Kirkby: at first, she says, she and her colleagues were given \u201ca bit of creative control\u201d over how they taught, and the workload seemed manageable. Soon enough, though, more and more time was eaten up by paperwork and marking based on individual targets for each student \u2013 \u201ca box-ticking exercise\u201d \u2013 that entailed two hours\u2019 extra work each night, another couple of hours on Saturday mornings, and more time each Sunday, stretching into the evening.\nDeegan took a year\u2019s maternity leave in 2010, and came back to find that her workload had been ratcheted up yet further. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t seem to have time to breathe,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was as though they wanted to get through the teaching day as quickly as possible because they knew how much other work they had to do. You\u2019d think: \u2018Oh, three more lessons to go \u2013 then I can tackle those mails, and that marking, and those assessments.\u2019\u201d She soon cut her hours to three days a week, but found herself working an unpaid extra day just to on top of things. \u201cPart-time teaching is all the accountability and all the guilt for half the pay,\u201d she says.\nDeegan left her job in July last year. She now does a day-and-a half-of language teaching in primary schools, as well as some supply teaching \u2013 and earns just over half of what she used to. \u201cFor a long time, teaching was my identity: that was who I was,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I won\u2019t be going back to full-time teaching, or even part-time. Not a chance.\u201d\nAnother former teacher, who prefers to remain anonymous, tells me she qualified in Scotland in 2007, and eventually took a job as a geography teacher in Sutton, in south London, paying \u00a3550 a month to share a flat with two other people. Her working day began at 7.30am, and she was responsible for 13 different classes, with all the associated paperwork. In an attempt to avoid burnout, she moved to Manchester and started supply teaching, before taking a full-time, \u00a328,000-a-year job in Bolton, where the number of her classes increased.\nIf somebody had said, \u2018You can have 60 grand a year to stay,\u2019 I would still have said no\n\u201cI started in September 2012, and by December, I was diagnosed with depression, brought on by stress,\u201d she says. She left teaching when she became pregnant and resolved not to go back. She now works for a children\u2019s charity: \u201cIf somebody had said, \u2018You can have 60 grand a year to stay,\u2019 I would still have said no,\u201d she says.\nThis sense of grind and impossible demands inevitably trickles down to trainee teachers. Andy Howes, who is in charge of secondary-school PCGE courses at Manchester University, tells me that stress about paperwork and marking is something that he regularly has to deal with. \u201cIt\u2019s the day-to-day grind of some school policies that some trainees find difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have quite a lot of conversations with trainees, to say, \u2018If that\u2019s the situation, don\u2019t stay. Find somewhere else.\u2019 It\u2019s a constant thread, definitely.\u201d\nAnother factor, he says, is the government\u2019s drive, chiefly via the School Direct programme, to push down the number of trainees based in universities and colleges, encouraging graduates to locate themselves in individual schools. \u201cYou have to decide: \u2018Well, which school, or school partnership, do I want to put my trust in?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking at as a graduate because you\u2019ve not got the experience \u2026 I think that\u2019s probably led to some people deciding that teaching\u2019s not for them.\u201d\nHe echoes concerns about subjects such as maths and the sciences feeling the pinch. \u201cI think that\u2019s a combination of the economy picking up, and the fact there\u2019s just not that straightforward route into teaching,\u201d he says. Howes runs a course for people who haven\u2019t got degrees in physics \u2013 an A-level is the basic requirement \u2013 but want to become physics teachers. \u201cThe number of schools I\u2019m working with who haven\u2019t got properly trained physics teachers is massive,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just keep coming across the fact that trainees are working with teachers who are not themselves trained in physics.\u201d It takes me a while to process what this means, in some cases: people without physics degrees being helped to teach physics by people who don\u2019t have physics degrees either.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Simon Barber, headteacher at Holy Trinity School in Barnsley \u2026 \u2018If the maths department goes down, the whole school goes down.\u2019 Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian\nThe day after my trip to Eastwood, I arrive at another school in the middle of a former coalfield: Holy Trinity in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, a Catholic and Church of England school whose 1,150 pupils range in age from three to 16. The head here is 46-year-old Simon Barber: a one-time primary school teacher with a specialism in music \u2013 he plays the viola \u2013 who now manages 43 secondary school teachers, and 17 who work at primary level. The school \u2013 overseen by the local council, rather than being an academy \u2013 opened in 2012, and sits on a giant site, with buildings and classrooms that exude a sense of confidence and purpose in difficult circumstances. \u201cWe\u2019re still emerging,\u201d Barber tells me. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re the finished article yet.\u201d\nAt the end of last year, Barnsley was one of 13 places \u2013 just about all of them in the north, and also including Blackpool, Doncaster and Hartlepool \u2013 that Ofsted chief Michael Wilshaw said had too many schools \u201clanguishing in mediocrity\u201d. Holy Trinity, in fact, has a \u201cgood\u201d Ofsted rating, but Barber obviously thinks such a sweeping judgment caused nothing but problems, particularly when it comes to recruiting new teachers.\nBarber hands me a sheet of paper recording all the vacancies he has advertised over the last few years, and how many applications he got back. A job teaching art attracted 18 \u2013 because, he says, thanks to the changes pushed through by the government, \u201cschools are now actively reducing numbers of art teachers\u201d, and many are going spare. By contrast, the numbers of people applying for jobs teaching English, science and computing never got any higher than four \u2013 and appointing a new head of maths, he says, was \u201can absolute nightmare\u201d.\nAppointing a new head of maths was a nightmare\nFinding heads of departments, he says, is a particular problem, what with Ofsted ready to pounce, and results in key subjects so crucial for a school\u2019s reputation: \u201cIf you\u2019re the head of maths or the head of English, you are so accountable: if the maths department goes down, the whole school goes down.\u201d For this job, the school got four applications, three of which were \u201cno good\u201d, leaving one that he says was outstanding. The applicant came from a large academy chain, which for some reason, had given her a poor reference.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t understand it \u2013 what we could see in front of us, and what the reference said were completely at odds with each other,\u201d he says. He decided to employ her, and she accepted \u2013 but a few weeks before the end of term, he received a call saying she wouldn\u2019t take the job after all. \u201cThe next thing I know, this chain was announcing its new head of maths in a brand-new academy,\u201d he says. \u201cPresumably, they offered her a better deal.\u201d He suddenly looks pained. \u201cI feel like the corner shop up against Tesco. These academy chains have huge resources, and lots of lots of schools. I won\u2019t appoint anyone I don\u2019t think is capable of doing the job. That would still be my official line. But the truth is, you do find yourself thinking: if I don\u2019t appoint this person and I advertise again, that\u2019s going to cost me another \u00a33,500 when money is really tight.\u201d\nHow physics makes the world your oyster | Letters Read more\nA couple of years ago, he says, he lost one of his art teachers. \u201cShe was absolutely brilliant,\u201d he says. \u201cThe kids loved art; she switched them on to it. I was loving it, seeing kids wanting to do art, and doing really well in the exams. And then she said: \u2018I can\u2019t cope with it. I go home every night, and I cry.\u2019 She got out of teaching and she\u2019s doing something completely different now.\nIt\u2019s a small story: one regrettable episode in the midst of thousands. But in all kinds of ways, it means a lot. \u201cShe was an absolutely amazing teacher,\u201d he says, quietly. \u201cA massive loss.\u201d", "date_time": "2016-02-01T18:17:23", "author": "John Harris", "lang": "en", "topic": "Teacher shortages|Teaching|Teacher training|Schools|Ofsted|School funding|features", "category": "UK|education", "title": "Long hours, endless admin and angry parents - why schools just can\u2019t get the teachers", "source": "guardian", "intro": "British schools are reporting a classroom crisis, with thousands of disaffected teachers leaving the profession, and new graduates discouraged from training because of the daily stress and grind.

Other select committees are meanwhile preparing assessments of different aspects of the bill.\nInvestigatory powers bill: the key points Read more\nLaunching the report, the Conservative MP Nicola Blackwood, who is chair of the committee, said: \u201cIt is vital we get the balance right between protecting our security and the health of our economy. We need our security services to be able to do their job and prevent terrorism, but as legislators we need to be careful not to inadvertently disadvantage the UK\u2019s rapidly growing tech sector.\n\u201cThe current lack of clarity within the draft investigatory powers bill is causing concern amongst businesses... The government must urgently review the legislation so that the obligations on the industry are clear and proportionate.\n\u201cThere remain questions about the feasibility of collecting and storing internet connection records (ICRs), including concerns about ensuring security for the records from hackers. The bill was intended to provide clarity to the industry, but the current draft contains very broad and ambiguous definitions of ICRs, which are confusing communications providers. This must be put right for the bill to achieve its stated security goals.\u201d\nThe collection of ICRs is to allow law enforcement agencies to identify the communications service to which a device has connected. The report calls on the government to ensure that obligations it is imposing on industry are both clear and proportionate.\nThe committee accepts the principle that intelligence and security agencies should \u201cin tightly prescribed circumstances be able to seek to obtain unencrypted data from communications service providers\u201d.\nThe report says: \u201cHowever, there is confusion about how the draft bill would affect end-to-end encrypted communications, where decryption might not be possible by a communications provider that had not added the original encryption.\n\u201cThe government should clarify and state clearly in the codes of practice (which will be published alongside the bill itself) that it will not be seeking unencrypted content in such cases, in line with the way existing legislation is currently applied.\u201d\nCommenting on encryption, Blackwood said: \u201cEncryption is important in providing the secure services on the internet we all rely on, from credit card transactions and commerce to legal or medical communications.\n\u201cIt is essential that the integrity and security of legitimate online transactions is maintained if we are to trust in, and benefit from, the opportunities of an increasingly digital economy. The government needs to do more to allay unfounded concerns that encryption will no longer be possible.\u201d\nPrivacy watchdog attacks snooper's charter over encryption Read more\nThe MPs said the evidence they received suggested there were still many unanswered questions about how this legislation would work \u201cin the fast moving world\u201d of technological innovation. \u201cThere are good grounds to believe that without further refinement, there could be many unintended consequences for commerce arising from the current lack of clarity of the terms and scope of the legislation,\u201d they added.\nAntony Walker, deputy CEO of techUK, which represents the technology industry, said: \u201cThere are several important recommendations in this report that we urge the Home Office to take on board. In particular we need more clarity on fundamental issues, such as core definitions, encryption and equipment interference.\n\u201cThese are all issues that we highlighted to the committee and can be addressed both in the bill and in the codes of practice which we believe must be published alongside the bill, and regularly updated, as recommended by the committee. Without that additional detail, too much of the bill will be open to interpretation, which undermines trust in both the legislation and the reputation of companies that have to comply with it.\n\u201cThe draft bill presents an opportunity for the UK government to develop a world-leading legal framework that balances the security needs with democratic values and protects the health of our growing digital economy. But we have to get the details right.\u201d\nMatthew Rice, advocacy officer at Privacy International, said: \u201cThe home secretary introduced the draft investigatory powers bill as a \u2018gold standard\u2019 for surveillance legislation. Yet the bill is quickly tarnishing under scrutiny. Civil society, industry and now the science and technology committee all agree that the draft bill raises substantial concerns because of its lack of clarity and intrusive proposals.\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s report shows that the safety and security of users\u2019 data may be threatened. The draft bill must be substantially revised or it will put the UK economy, as well as our privacy and security, at risk.\u201d\nSilkie Carlo, technology and surveillance policy officer for Liberty, said: \u201cToday MPs confirm what campaigners and tech experts have been telling the government for months \u2013 the draft bill\u2019s lack of clarity in defining or limiting surveillance powers puts us all at risk. Business is no exception.\n\u201cThe forced removal of encryption from services like WhatsApp, mass hacking authorised on a whim and records of the population\u2019s internet history would severely undermine the UK\u2019s technology sector.\n\u201cThe loss of public trust in UK tech services that the report describes is reflective of the loss of trust in freedom of expression and privacy online \u2013 trust that would be impossible to regain.

Instead of swinging the metaphorical man-bag, he looks for common ground and enumerates the issues that remain controversial, striving to expand the former and resolve or defer the latter.\nLike Tony Blair finalising the Good Friday agreement, he grasps the value of constructive ambiguity. The language of diplomacy is necessarily elastic, so things may be presented in different ways to different audiences.\nWhether Brexit or Bremain, fear will triumph over fear | Timothy Garton Ash Read more\nIn politics, as in life, the alchemy of deals has as much to do with momentum, linguistic creativity, impatience and exhaustion as it does with content. In a negotiating process, there is a point where everyone has been marched to the top of the hill, and the idea of marching back down again with nothing achieved remains conceivable \u2013 but no more.\nSince launching this strategy four years ago, Cameron has played the part of the man wrapped in the union flag determined to squeeze a better deal from Europe, ready, if all else fails, to countenance departure. But that act is wearing thin. This prime minister is a clubbable man who relishes his seat at top table and does not happily leave any inner sanctum. He is also a master of the arts of political theatre, and knows that he must soon \u2013 perhaps very soon \u2013 change persona, adopting the mask of the campaign leader rather than the Brussels wheeler-dealer.\nBrexit is but one of the dragons that the EU oligarchy must slay.

For Cameron, all else is now subordinate to this enterprise. On Friday, he held a hastily scheduled meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president (whose appointment he so vigorously opposed in 2014).\nOn Sunday Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, was his dinner guest at No 10: a private curtain-raiser for the proposals that Tusk is expected to publish shortly. If they provide an acceptable framework, the deal will be signed off (in theory) at the EU summit on 18 and 19 February \u2013 or possibly at a separate gathering, dedicated to the prevention of Brexit. The referendum itself would then be held on 23 June.\nWhatever Cameron squeezes out of his EU counterparts will be dismissed by the various \u201cout\u201d campaigns. Juncker could agree to copy out Magna Carta in his own handwriting, declare that the only good thing to come out of Brussels since the Schuman Plan in 1951 is sprouts, and apologise individually for every allegedly banned straight banana \u2013 and Nigel Farage would still say that the PM was \u201cselling out\u201d the nation.\nMore psychologically intriguing is the likely response to a deal of the in camp, presently gathered under the umbrella of Britain Stronger in Europe. There has been much coverage of the strong personalities engaged in the fight to leave the EU. But consider the oddity of the position in which most of the in camp\u2019s leading figures, such as Danny Alexander, Peter Mandelson, and Brendan Barber, now find themselves. Many of them are lifelong champions of the EU, embattled defenders of common sense (as they see it) against the foghorn of the Eurosceptic press and the Tory party\u2019s entrenched hostility to the EU. And now they await the return of a Conservative prime minister from the negotiations he himself forced so that he may lead the campaign to win a referendum some of them privately believe is a terrible mistake and a colossal gamble.\nNever forget that Cameron, like almost every Tory of his generation, is a Eurosceptic to his fingertips, a Conservative who instinctively believes the EU to be (as he said in 2014) \u201ctoo big, too bossy, too interfering\u201d. Yes, he charged his party to stop \u201cbanging on\u201d about Europe. But that was about winning votes, and sharing the electorate\u2019s priorities, rather than a thaw in the Tory approach to the EU.\nIndeed, Cameron\u2019s trajectory led in precisely the opposite direction. In the 2005 leadership contest, he won the support of many on the right by promising to pull Tory MEPs out of the European People\u2019s party (EPP), the principal centre-right grouping in the European parliament. Four years later he kept his promise, withdrawing his MEPs from the EPP and forming a new anti-federalist bloc, the European Conservatives and Reformists. In December 2011, to the fury of his coalition deputy, Nick Clegg, he \u201cvetoed\u201d a deal to reform the euro. In the same year his government passed the European Union Act, mandating that a national referendum be held whenever the EU threatened to encroach significantly upon UK sovereignty. Yet it was never enough for his querulous backbenchers. They hated coalition, and Clegg.\nBritain\u2019s future must lie within a reformed Europe | Nicky Morgan Read more\nAnd they were furious that Cameron\u2019s \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty had been rendered null and void when it entered EU law. He and George Osborne had also concluded that the eurozone crisis was an opportunity to be exploited: as the third-biggest net contributor to the EU, Britain was in a decent position to demand renegotiation of its membership terms as the price for its cooperation with the institutional measures taken to safeguard the single currency. If the matter was to be put to people, the question had to be \u201cin or out?\u201d. All else would be evasion, so many years after the 1975 referendum. That, at least, was the logic that underpinnedCameron\u2019s Bloomberg speech in January 2013 promising a vote on Brexit before the end of 2017.\nWe do not yet know which politician will lead the out campaign. But \u2013 barring a historic upset \u2013 it will be Cameron who heads the opposing team. Like a quick-change artist, he will ditch the outfit of a hard-nosed Eurosceptic negotiator and present himself afresh as an enthusiast for the new EU and Britain\u2019s place in it. He has to persuade the voters that they absolutely must remain part of a continental alliance about which he has been at best extremely critical and at worst downright dismissive.\nThere are those who see this as a potential advantage to the in camp, on the basis that the default position of the British people is essentially that of an instinctive Eurosceptic who is nonetheless unwilling to risk exit from the EU fold. But there is also scope for confusion, not to mention cognitive dissonance: why is this pro-EU campaign being led by a politician who patently dislikes what he is defending? Will the in camp be a broad church or a Babel? We\u2019ll know soon enough.

In fact, any occupancy by a person who is living there as their main home is captured by the legislation. The level of awareness in these areas is even lower.\nThe checking process is also complex. A landlord must either see a passport or identity card from a European Economic Area (EEA) country, a passport with a visa showing a right to rent in the UK, an asylum seeker identity card endorsed with a right to rent, or two documents from a list of other options for those who do not have passports.

{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/easter-rising-century-ireland-1916", "content": "The past is wildly unpredictable. The memory of the Easter Rising, the week-long rebellion in Dublin whose centenary is being marked this year, has long been haunted by an anxious question: is it over yet? The rising can be seen as a foundational event for three political entities: the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and (though this is conveniently ignored) the current United Kingdom, which changed radically when most of Ireland won its independence. Yet the struggle has always been to decide whether it is history or current affairs, something that has happened or a harbinger of something yet to happen, done and dusted or unfinished business.\nContested legacy: echoes of the Easter Rising Read more\nAs a historical fact, the Rising seems quite small and self-contained. It was a little sideshow to the cataclysmic main event: the first world war. Even in Irish terms, it was, objectively, quite marginal. About 1,600 men and women took some part in the rebellion during Easter week of 1916. By contrast, about a quarter of a million Irishmen fought in the Great War. During the Rising 485 men, women and children (mostly civilians) died in Dublin. In the same week 570 Irish soldiers were killed in a single horrific German gas attack at Hulluch on the western front \u2013 an event that is scarcely remembered. The Rising is just a drop in an ocean of blood.\nIt was also staged by a minority of a minority. The rebels came from two fringe groups, the militantly nationalist Irish Volunteers and the tiny socialist Irish Citizen Army. It was planned and carried out by a faction within the secret conspiratorial Irish Republican Brotherhood. But even most of the militants who believed that an armed rebellion was a good idea in principle did not think that it made sense to go ahead in 1916 without public support and substantial assistance from the Germans.\nAnd as a military adventure the Rising was, of course, a dismal failure. Very little happened outside Dublin, and in the capital the rising was largely a matter of holding a number of public buildings until the British authorities recovered from their shock and assembled the overwhelming force that inevitably crushed it. The Irish Republican Army that emerged after 1916 never attempted to replicate the tactics of Easter week, implicitly acknowledging that they were, from a practical point of view, useless.\nSo why is this relatively minor disturbance so potent? Precisely because it is so hard to say what it means. It is one of those events that has a protean quality \u2013 it continually changes its shape. The most famous lines about the Rising are WB Yeats\u2019s from Easter 1916: All changed, changed utterly / A Terrible beauty is born. But in fact the terrible beauty was not just born: it remains alive. And, like any living thing, it alters over time. Among the things that change utterly and constantly is the meaning of the Rising itself.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest British soldiers inspect the shell of Dublin\u2019s General Post Office after trhe fighting of 1916 Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images\nEaster Rising 100 years on: share your photos and stories Read more\nThis was true almost from the start. Many people knew exactly what they thought of it. Mainstream Irish nationalists saw it as tragic folly. Irish unionists, especially in Ulster, saw it as a stab in the back in Britain\u2019s hour of need, final proof that Irish Catholics could never be trusted. But these simple meanings were challenged by much more complex emotions. When the British authorities executed 15 rebel leaders during May 1916 (a 16th, Sir Roger Casement, was hanged in London in August) the public mood began to change. The rebels, instead of being dangerous lunatics, became martyrs. More specifically they became Catholic martyrs. As the rebel leader Patrick Pearse had clearly envisaged, the sacrifice at Easter was folded into the greatest of all blood sacrifices, that of Christ himself.\nWhat happened to the Rising is that it very quickly moved out of the realm of historical fact and into that of the imagination. On the level of fact, for example, the idea of blood sacrifice doesn\u2019t really hold up. The rich archive of statements by rebels yields very few examples of young men and women who thought they were going out to be killed in a hopeless cause \u2013 most thought (naively) that they were going to win. And in fact the rebels suffered remarkably few casualties: just 16% of the dead of Easter week were rebels, and most of the casualties were poor slum dwellers caught in crossfire and in British shelling.\nAs Patrick Pearse envisaged, the sacrifice at Easter was folded into the greatest of blood sacrifices, that of Christ\nThese facts, though, scarcely matter. Imaginatively, an anonymous kid blown apart by a shell cannot compete with the heartbreaking drama of the great socialist James Connolly being executed by a firing squad while tied to a chair because he was already wounded and could not stand. When, on the 10th anniversary of the Rising in 1926, Se\u00e1n O\u2019Casey, another working-class socialist, tried to write the slum dwellers back into the story, his play The Plough and the Stars, was greeted by riots. The Rising itself, retrospectively reshaped as a ritual of heroic male self-sacrifice (the women were quickly written out too) is an even more potent drama than O\u2019Casey\u2019s masterpiece. It is gripping, compelling and intensely moving.\nYet this imaginative triumph is also the reason why the Rising generates such anxiety. Facts can be analysed, weighed, placed in perspective. They accommodate complexity and ambiguity. Imaginative happenings make different kinds of demands. They compel us to enter fully into their spirit. So what is the spirit of 1916? In part at least it is the spirit of armed propaganda, the notion that a visionary minority can, without popular consent, stage a symbolic coup that will awaken the slumbering majority to its historic duties. The problem with the Rising is that, even while the Irish state claims it as its foundation stone, its imaginative logic is equally available to violent minorities, such as the Provisional IRA and its even more marginal successors. Far beyond Ireland, the Rising can be drawn on by any armed group to prove that yesterday\u2019s terrorists will be today\u2019s martyrs and tomorrow\u2019s triumphant revolutionaries.\nHow do we contain this imaginative power? In part by shifting back to facts. So far the commemorations of the Rising have been doing a pretty good job of restoring more complex realities, treating the rebels as neither saints nor terrorists but real political actors in a wider European conflict. It is encouraging that the biggest selling book on the centenary is not a hagiography but Joe Duffy\u2019s painstaking recovery of the names and stories of the 40 children who were killed by rebels or British forces. The context of the first world war, the central role of women and Dublin\u2019s horrendous poverty are all being written back into the story of the Rising.\nWelcome as this is, however, facts will not be enough. We have to accept that the Rising will always be imaginatively powerful and to ask, as Yeats and O\u2019Casey did, what exactly it is that we want to imagine. If the Rising is potent because it functions as much as a work of art as a historical event, the glory of art is that it can always be reimagined. The imaginative space that the Rising opens up can be filled with much more than myths of blood sacrifice. It can accommodate too the idea that the rebels themselves imagined: a real republic of equal citizens. That too is unfinished business that makes powerful demands on Ireland\u2019s future.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T08:30:23", "author": "Fintan O'Toole", "lang": "en", "topic": "Ireland|Opinion|First world war|Europe|comment", "category": "opinion", "title": "The terrible beauty of the Easter Rising remains alive today", "source": "guardian", "intro": "A century on, the facts about Ireland\u2019s rebellion in 1916 are finally emerging from the long shadow of myth"},

It will also put resources behind a massive effort to prevent pregnant women becoming infected and, through mosquito control, stop the virus spreading.\nChan called the birth of thousands of babies with microcephaly \u201can extraordinary event and a public health threat to other parts of the world\u201d. She was speaking following a meeting of the WHO\u2019s international health regulations emergency committee, summoned to advise the director general on whether to make the declaration, which calls in international resources and expertise.\n\u201cMembers of the committee agreed that the situation meets the conditions for a public health emergency of international concern. I have accepted this advice,\u201d she said.\nChan, who was criticised for being slow to make a similar declaration while Ebola spread across west Africa, sidestepped the question when asked if she felt that was a factor in the response to the Zika crisis in Brazil.\n\u201cIt is important to realise that when the evidence first becomes available of such a serious condition like microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities, we need to take action, including precautionary measures,\u201d she said.\nTropical disease experts involved in the Ebola epidemic applauded the declaration. \u201cThe WHO faced heavy criticism for waiting too long to declare the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency and they should be congratulated for being far more proactive this time,\u201d said Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. \u201cToday\u2019s declaration will give the WHO the authority and resources it needs to lead the international response to Zika.\u201d\nChan called for countries to refrain from imposing any sort of travel restrictions on those Latin American countries where the Zika virus is spreading.\nJonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said: \u201cA kneejerk response would be to ban travel and trade with countries affected, but the truth is that the potential problem is much wider. It wouldn\u2019t really be feasible to lock down the affected countries to try to stop the spread of a virus that is carried by the Aedes mosquito, especially when affected and unaffected countries border one another.\n\u201cUntil populations can build up sufficient immunity, either through natural infection or through vaccination, then the risk to pregnant women is real and therefore this group need to take extra care to avoid becoming exposed.\u201d\nProf David Heymann, chair of the emergency committee, stressed that the most serious issue was not the Zika virus itself, which causes a mild illness, but the microcephaly cases in babies. \u201cZika alone would never be a public health emergency of international concern,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a clinically serious infection.\u201d For that reason, he said, it was a very difficult decision.\nThe microcephaly clusters so far have appeared in Brazil and \u2013 in 2014 before anybody realised the significance \u2013 Polynesia. That, said Heymann, showed \u201cit appears to be spreading\u201d.\nBrazil has dispatched hundreds of thousands of troops on mosquito-eradication campaigns in the the worst affected areas, but the government is struggling to comprehend let alone cope with the epidemic.\nWhile reported cases have spiked since the virus was first identified in the country last year, officials admit their estimate of 1.5m cases is based on guesswork.\nZika virus could be bigger global health threat than Ebola, say health experts Read more\n\u201cEighty percent of the people infected by Zika do not develop significant symptoms,\u201d the health minister Marcelo Castro told Reuters. \u201cA large number of people have the virus with no symptoms, so the situation is more serious that we can imagine.\u201d\nIn an effort to get a clearer picture, the authorities have instructed local health authorities to report on all cases from next week, when most states should have the equipment and personnel to carry out Zica tests. It will ban people who have the virus from donating blood.\nDespite the lack of reliable data, Castro said researchers were convinced that the virus was the cause of a spike in reported cases of microcephaly. A link has not been proven, but concerns are growing because the disease and the abnormality have both risen sharply.\nBrazil\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff, acknowledged at the weekend that the country was losing the battle. \u201cWe do not have a vaccine for Zika yet. The only thing we can do is fight the mosquito,\u201d she told reporters during a visit to the emergency headquarters of the anti-Zika campaign. \u201cAs long as [the mosquitoes] are reproducing, we are all losing the battle. We have to mobilise to win it\u201d.\nCity at centre of Brazil's Zika epidemic reeling from disease's insidious effects Read more\nPublic health officials, backed by 220,000 troops, have stepped up efforts to kill breeding grounds of the Aedes mosquito, particularly in the poverty stricken northeast, where most cases have been concentrated.\nOn Monday, Rousseff signed a law allowing health officials access to any building to eradicate breeding grounds.\nThe new law allows health officials access to all homes, and public and private buildings, even if the property\u2019s owner cannot be located. Officials can request backup from police to raid any building suspected of being a mosquito breeding ground.\nAn estimated 1.5 million Brazilians have caught Zika, a virus first detected in Africa in the 1940s and unknown in the Americas until it appeared in May. The Pan-American Health Organisation said the virus had since spread to 24 countries and territories in the hemisphere.\nBy next month, the labs will have a test that can detect all three viruses borne by the Aedes mosquito \u2013 dengue, Chikungunya and Zika. The test, however, will only be effective during the initial infection period of five days.\nHow can the world fight Zika \u2013 silent menace that threatens the unborn? Read more\nOne of the main drivers of the WHO\u2019s declaration of an emergency is to fund and launch studies to find out where there is a definitive association with the Zika virus. Chan said: The evidence is growing and it is getting stronger. We need a coordinated international response to get to the bottom of this.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a very complicated issue,\u201d said Heymann. \u201cTo figure out the link with Zika virus, large numbers of cases of microcephaly have to be traced and assessed and the exposure of the mother to Zika virus has to be established. But the USA is working with Brazil and studies will start in the next two weeks.\u201d\nChen said surveillance needed to be strengthened. Scientists involved in the studies will need reliable reports of every case of microcephaly, which may not automatically be reported to doctors, especially in remote and poorer areas of Latin America.

And now he\u2019s pretending that that never happened and it did.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about immigration. It\u2019s about the calculation that he thinks he can say and do anything and people aren\u2019t going to notice,\u201d Rubio said.\nRubio did not enter the final stretch of the Iowa caucus at the top of the polls, but nonetheless his rivals felt sufficiently threatened to spend at least $20m on ads attacking him \u2013 largely focused on his record on immigration. At present he stands third in polling behind Cruz and frontrunner Donald Trump in Iowa, and third in the national Republican race.\nCruz\u2019s closing argument across Iowa drew heavily on Rubio\u2019s support in 2013 for a comprehensive bill to make the case that \u201ca vote for Marco Rubio is a vote for amnesty\u201d.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been clear,\u201d Rubio told the Guardian. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can fix this comprehensively, I\u2019ve been very clear about that. That was tried. It failed, for good reason, because Americans don\u2019t trust the federal government and we\u2019re going to have to do this in stages beginning with enforcement.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marco Rubio speaks to guests at a town-hall-style meeting on in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images\nImmigration has been at the forefront of the Republican primary, spurred by a grassroots anger that has helped send Trump and Cruz to the top of the polls.\nThe Texas senator has adopted an especially hardline position, shifting his stance on work permits for foreign workers and birthright citizenship. While he maintains he never supported legalization for undocumented immigrants, and was simply using procedural tactics to derail Rubio\u2019s bill in 2013, it was not until December that Cruz explicitly ruled out providing the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US with a path to legal status.\nIn last week\u2019s Republican debate, Cruz sought to once more shift the focus back toward Rubio\u2019s prior efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform. He was joined, somewhat unexpectedly, by former Florida governor Jeb Bush \u2013 who charged that Rubio \u201ccut and ran\u201d from his own bill when faced with resistance from conservatives.\nAsked by the Guardian to respond to the criticism, Rubio said his legislation \u2013 known as the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d after the bipartisan group of senators who worked on it \u2013 was no longer relevant.\n\u201cThe bill has no chance of passing. There is no support for a path that does not first involve bringing illegal immigration under control. Period,\u201d Rubio said.\nTed Cruz denies immigration policy flip-flop in defense against Marco Rubio Read more\n\u201cAnyone who continues to insist, like Jeb does, that it needs to be done comprehensively and through one massive piece of legislation is not being realistic. They\u2019re not being serious about it.\n\u201cThere is no way to solve this issue until first we bring illegal immigration under control and prove to the American people that it\u2019s under control,\u201d he added.\nVoters have nonetheless taken notice of the barrage of attack ads against Rubio, particularly some that recycle clips of him advocating a path to citizenship during the 2013 debate. At town halls here over the past week, there were several instances in which potential caucus-goers said they were confused about where, precisely, he now stood on so-called \u201camnesty\u201d.\nRubio pushed back emphatically, insisting he has never been, and will never be, for \u201cblanket amnesty\u201d. He also drew on his roots, as the son of Cuban immigrants and from a predominantly immigrant community in West Miami, to cast himself as speaking with particular authority on the issue.\n\u201cAs the son and grandson of immigrants, I can say that enforcing immigration laws is not anti-immigrant,\u201d he told the hundreds who packed his town halls and rallies throughout Iowa.\nAs for his current position, Rubio has said he continues to support eventually providing green cards to law-abiding undocumented immigrants \u2013 only after the border is secure, legal immigration is reformed, and after they first receive work permits for 10 years. He has also reframed the immigration debate as one of national security, pointing to the threat posed by the Islamic State and the potential infiltration of terrorists across US borders.\nAs president, Rubio told the Guardian, his plan for undocumented immigrants would be shaped by the will of the American public, a debate he emphasized would only occur once illegal immigration was under control.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the American people are going to support anything until border security is first in place. After that, we\u2019ll see what people are willing to support,\u201d Rubio said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve outlined a way forward. We\u2019ll see if people support it.

Rain, sleet and snow don\u2019t just happen to you here \u2013 when the clouds part, you can see them coming.\nIowa caucus night live: high turnout reported for first vote of 2016 election Read more\nAs Iowans gather at caucus sites on Monday night to be the first people in the United States to help pick the next president, a blizzard will barrel over the plains. By the next morning, it will have dumped several inches of snow on the state as it heads north-west, leaving a trail of chaos and disruption.\nThis remains about the only clear prediction that anyone can make about what Iowa will look and feel like come Tuesday. This American primary season has been too volatile, dissentious and just plain eccentric for any overconfident forecast prior to the event.\nThe old rules, regarding financing, policy, gaffes, accuracy and media management, have ceased to apply. In normal times, for a candidate to call himself a socialist\u201d, skip the final debate, denigrate entire religious and national groups or have emails become the subject of a federal inquiry would damage, if not destroy, that candidate\u2019s prospects. An endorsement by Iowa\u2019s main paper, the Des Moines Register, was once universally regarded as a coveted prize; today some see its support of Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio as a liability that paints them as establishment candidates.\nCountdown to Iowa: a caucus guide for what to know about America's first vote Read more\nAnd appearances can be deceptive. Some of the people who waited for close to two hours in sub-freezing temperatures in Marshalltown to see Donald Trump were Democrats who came for the show; others might be categorised as celebrity seekers who had no intention of caucusing.\nOn a basketball court at Clinton middle school, in the east of the state, as Elton John, the Stones and Adele blared, Billie Selser, who was waiting for Trump, said: \u201cI watched him on TV, on The Apprentice. I\u2019m interested to see what he has to say.\u201d She and her husband Bruce had never voted in a caucus before \u2013 and struggled to recall ever having voted in a presidential election. They liked John F Kennedy, they agreed. \u201cAnd Clinton \u2013 Bill Clinton wasn\u2019t bad at all,\u201d Bruce said. Then, asking about Trump, he said: \u201cIs he Democrat, or more Republican?\u201d\nIn 2004, Howard Dean \u2013 like Clinton\u2019s current main rival, \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d Bernie Sanders \u2013 drew the biggest and most passionate crowds here, ostensibly bringing new young people into the process. Dean finished a distant third when the passionate failed to show up or opted for something they knew was less radical but thought was more achievable.\nBut none of this means that the old rules may not reassert themselves when it matters \u2013 on the night itself. The Iowa caucuses, in which people actually have to show up at a definite time and stick around, are decided by relatively small numbers and carried by the most dedicated and the best organised.\nHeather Johnson, a precinct captain for Hillary Clinton in Davenport, has been knocking on doors, calling supporters and galvanising the local faithful for months now. As the week ended, Barb Martney of Marshalltown, a Trump supporter, was still waiting for the campaign to send her the list of those leaning toward Trump in her area so she can remind them to show up. \u201cI\u2019ve asked for a list,\u201d she told National Journal. \u201cAnd there\u2019s only a few days left, so I hope it\u2019s soon.\u201d\nThe Des Moines Register\u2019s final poll, which has an impressive track record, gives Clinton a narrow lead over Sanders while Donald Trump holds a slightly wider but by no means unassailable edge over his main rival, conservative Texas senator Ted Cruz, ahead of the rest of the Republican pack.\nSabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) Final Bloomberg/DMR/Selzer Poll:\nTrump 28\nCruz 23\nRubio 15\nCarson 10\nPaul 5\nChristie 3\nBush/Fiorina/Huckabee/Kasich/Santorum 2\nUndecided 2\nThe campaigns within the two parties have been quite different. With so many candidates and such an iconoclastic frontrunner, the Republicans\u2019 race has been fragmented, fractious, unedifying and at times unhinged \u2013 a circular firing squad in which the gunmen episodically shoot themselves in the foot.\nBut history suggests Iowa Republicans are out of touch \u2013 of the last seven contested national caucuses, they have chosen the eventual nominee only three times. Presidents Santorum or Huckabee, anyone?\nThe Democratic race has been less entertaining and far more substantial and cordial. \u201cWe may have differences,\u201d Clinton said of the Sanders divide on Sunday in Des Moines, \u201cbut issues is a lot better way to inform the electorate than insults, which is what you\u2019re hearing from the Republicans.\u201d It\u2019s a more genteel version of 2008, with a gravelly, older white man \u2013 Sanders \u2013 playing a more politically radical, less personally appealing version of Barack Obama, while a more confident Clinton (playing herself) tries to parlay her inability to excite people into a virtue. \u201cI\u2019d rather under-promise and over-deliver,\u201d is her new rally cry.\nLessons from Iowa: real caucus victory comes from beating expectations Read more\nAt least Iowa Democrats do tend to have a surer sense of the national pulse. Of the last six contested primaries, Iowans have picked the eventual nominee every time.\nDespite the split between Democrats and Republicans, however, the mood dominating the contests in both parties has one common and important trait \u2013 nostalgia. Reagan announced a new morning in America; Bill Clinton posed as the boy from Hope at the helm of a \u201cnew generation of Democrats\u201d; Obama invoked change. But the campaign themes that seem to be resonating most on both sides this time offer not a route to to a dazzling new tomorrow but a return to the financial securities and generational certainties of the past.\nSanders harnesses anger at the financial class for extorting the nation\u2019s economics and distorting its politics. In the college town of Grinnell on Saturday, Sanders told students that the basic American birthright that each generation will enjoy a life better than the last has been stolen from them and must be recaptured. Some 24 hours later from Des Moines, he followed a star from The Hunger Games onstage: \u201cLet me say it for the umpteenth time \u2013 I believe healthcare is a right not a privilege.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sarah Gross, 22, and Dillan Newbold, 23, at a Bernie Sanders rally on Saturday night. Photograph: David Taylor for the Guardian\nIn his signature campaign ad, Sanders doesn\u2019t say a single word beyond his endorsement. Instead, Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s America (released in 1968) plays over scenes of farmers tending their flock, wind turbines spinning over a rural idyll, graphic designers at work, a gay couple in an embrace, families going about their day and people campaigning for him. As they belt out the chorus \u201cThey\u2019ve all come to look for America\u201d, you\u2019re left with the sense that the nation is lost and in need of retrieving. It couldn\u2019t be more retro if it were in black and white.\nNotably, at Sanders\u2019 climactic rally on Saturday night, young supporters clutching neon pink flashing Bernie signs did not know the song \u2013 but they got the sentiment.\nTrump, on the other hand, evokes a return to a time when being a white American meant something both at home and abroad \u2013 the citizen of an unrivalled superpower, with a monocultural polity, that intervenes in the world with the sole purpose of asserting its supremacy. It\u2019s an era before wars were lost in Muslim lands, white life expectancy started falling, the Latino population started booming and \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d forbade white Christian men from saying whatever came in to their heads.\nOutside Trump\u2019s rallies, you can buy hats emblazoned with his slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d and badges stating \u201cBomb the shit out of Isis\u201d and \u201cHillary for prison 2016\u201d. They play guitar in cowboy hats.\nGary Younge (@garyyounge) Oh, there was this as well pic.twitter.com/ftoddKMF9g\nInside, Trump bloviates like a drunk uncle at a barbecue: \u201cThe Chinese want to steal everything we have\u201d; \u201cGlenn Beck is a nut job\u201d; \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a real wall. It\u2019s going to be a big wall. We can build it so big, so beautiful, so strong, so powerful\u201d; \u201cObamacare is a disaster, by the way\u201d; \u201cWe can\u2019t have people chopping off heads.\u201d\nOn Sunday afternoon at a gymnasium in Council Bluffs, Trump finally lightened up. His wife, Melania, had finally emerged alongside him, to complement the mogul turned frontrunner as \u201cunbelievable, the best deal maker, the best master negotiator\u201d.\n\u201cThank you, honey,\u201d he said with slightly less bluster, before the snow came in. \u201cThat\u2019s so nice.\u201d\nSanders and Trump could not be more different. The former focuses frustration on the powerful, the latter on the powerless. But the source of that frustration is the essentially the same. Wages are stagnant, a generation of wealth has been wiped out, social mobility has stalled, and the government doesn\u2019t work. Sanders rails against big money in politics; one of the things Trump\u2019s supporters like about him is that he\u2019s so rich he can\u2019t be bought.\nSanders and Trump are not the only candidates. But they have set the tone for the campaigns on both sides pulling the field to the left and right, respectively. When they announced their candidacies, conventional wisdom suggested neither was in with a shot. \u201cWhen we started this we had three people, we had no name recognition and no money, and we were 50 points down in the polls,\u201d said Sanders\u2019 Iowa campaign co-ordinator on Sunday. Now both are viable.\nBut then, conventional wisdom has counted little in this campaign. These are uncharted waters. And there\u2019s a big storm brewing.\nAdditional reporting by Dan Roberts in Waterloo, Paul Lewis in Council Bluffs and Sabrina Siddiqui in Des Moines.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T05:05:13", "author": "Gary Younge", "lang": "en", "topic": "US elections 2016|Iowa|Bernie Sanders|Donald Trump|Hillary Clinton|US politics|features", "category": "world|US", "title": "Iowa caucus results are as unpredictable as this bizarre election season", "source": "guardian", "intro": "With Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump setting the tone, conventional political wisdom has had little place in the 2016 presidential race"},

However, they aren\u2019t particularly intuitive to understand or follow. (Even though we\u2019ll be live-blogging them all day and night at the Guardian from here across the first-in-the-nation voting state.)\nWhat time do the caucuses start?\nThe caucuses start at 7pm local time on Monday, but campaigns encourage their supporters to show up half an hour early.\nHow do the caucuses unfold?\nVery different rules govern the Democratic and Republican caucuses:\nRepublicans have a relatively straightforward process, in which they cast secret ballots in their precinct caucuses \u2013 church halls, school buildings.\nBy contrast, Democrats vote publicly in a two-stage election where candidates must get support of 15% of caucus-goers in each individual precinct to be viable. If they fall below that threshold, their voters need to choose another candidate or go home. After that redistribution, votes are counted and from those totals, delegates are assigned.\nLessons from Iowa: real caucus victory comes from beating expectations Read more\nCan unregistered voters take part?\nAny Iowan who will be over the age of 18 at the time of the presidential election (on 8 November) can participate. Attendees can register on the night at the caucuses and can switch their party affiliation there as well. This means a Democrat can go to the Republican caucuses and vice versa. Four years ago, 121,503 people showed up to the 2012 Republican caucuses. Democrats have traditionally had higher turnout and, in their last competitive caucus in 2008, 239,872 people attended.\nWhat happens then?\nThe caucuses are political party-run processes with no state involvement, so the reporting of results doesn\u2019t happen through state election officials. Instead, local volunteers at each caucus location across Iowa\u2019s 99 counties report them. This means there can potentially be many hiccups:\nFor Republicans, the ballots are tallied and counted at each caucus site and reported to the state party.\nUnder the Democratic system, only the actual number of delegates pledged to each candidate is reported and not any actual vote counts.\nBarring reporting issues, a clear idea of the results should emerge by around 9.30pm local time.\nHow are delegates decided?\nAmerican presidential primaries are all about electing delegates to the party conventions which are staged over the summer and where nominees to run for president will formally be chosen. The caucuses don\u2019t formally select those delegates. Instead, they represent the first stage in Iowa\u2019s multi-part selection process, but campaigns and the media will be able to extrapolate how many delegates they will receive based on Monday\u2019s result.\nAfter Iowa, three more states \u2013 New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada \u2013 will hold standalone, early contests in February. Then, starting 1 March, the calendar starts to fill up, beginning with \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d, when 12 states will hold nominating contests. The primary election will then continue until 7 June, when the final six states, including California, hold their elections.\nWhere will the candidates be on the night?\nHow the Iowa caucuses work: a confusing election process explained Read more\nMost candidates will be holding election night parties in and around the state capitol of Des Moines on Monday night to watch the results. Some are already in New Hampshire, though. Ohio governor John Kasich has long since written off Iowa to campaign almost exclusively in the Granite state and former Florida governor Jeb Bush will fly to New Hampshire on Monday after a last minute campaign swing through Iowa. Both candidates are currently polling at 2% in Iowa.\nWhat happens next?\nMost of the candidates will go off to New Hampshire with charter planes expected to depart Des Moines for Manchester sometime after midnight on Tuesday morning. However, one or two Republican candidates may try to skip New Hampshire to shore up their campaigns in South Carolina, which holds the third Republican primary this year, and it\u2019s likely that at least one candidate will end their campaign after Iowa.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 4 February 2016 to clarify the answer to \u201cCan unregistered voters take part?\u201d An earlier version said \u201cAny Iowan over the age of 18 can participate\u201d.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T05:00:26", "author": "Ben Jacobs", "lang": "en", "topic": "US elections 2016|Iowa|Republicans|Democrats", "category": "world|US", "title": "Countdown to Iowa: a caucus guide for what to know about America's first vote", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Caucuses are the first stage in key voting states\u2019 multi-part selection process and provide a litmus test for which party candidates who fare well in the primaries"},

I stand for the presidency until the end,\u201d insisted Infantino.\nIt had been speculated that an alliance between the pair would ensure Infantino was offered the Fifa general secretary\u2019s job if Sheikh Salman won the presidency.

We have to wait until the end of the proceedings before we can judge,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat I can say is that Mr Blatter has been for 40 years in Fifa. I respect very much all the work he did in terms of football development in particular around the world. We need to recognise that Fifa has in the last 40 years undergone a great development,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMr Blatter has said himself that he probably should have stepped back a little bit earlier.

He also promised an 11th proposal, which he said would be unveiled with a flourish to voters on 26 February.\nChallenged over the way in which Uefa has handled match-fixing scandals in Turkey and Greece, Infantino revealed that he and his family had received death threats and insisted no other body in the world could match its record in tackling the problem.\nThe other candidates in the race to succeed Blatter are the former Fifa executive committee member Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, the South African Tokyo Sexwale and former Fifa executive J\u00e9r\u00f4me Champagne.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T17:35:37", "author": "Owen Gibson", "lang": "en", "topic": "Fifa|Uefa|Football politics|news", "category": "football", "title": "Fifa presidential candidate Gianni Infantino reveals 90-day reform plan", "source": "guardian", "intro": "The Fifa presidential candidate Gianni Infantino says it is \u2018now or never\u2019 to change football\u2019s governing body"},

Unfortunately it was a \u2018no\u2019. So it\u2019s not going to be a fairytale ending. I\u2019m not going to retire at Chelsea.\u201d\nThat statement had apparently not been planned and was an impromptu response to a question thrown at him after the cup tie. But the suggestion the club\u2019s hierarchy are keen to discuss Terry\u2019s future with the candidate they appoint on a permanent basis in the summer is understood to have frustrated the 35-year-old, who is free to negotiate a deal with a foreign club for the end of the campaign.\nTerry, a veteran of 696 Chelsea appearances, has signed two one-year contract extensions since 2014, in line with the club\u2019s policy of offering 12-month deals to players over 30, with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in situ on both occasions to throw his support behind the centre-half. In 2014 the deal was not formalised until May and it was March last year before Chelsea made the announcement the player would be staying on for an 18th senior campaign at the club.\nYet, with no permanent head coach in place this time round, the club were apparently reluctant to pre-empt what their next manager\u2019s attitude would be on Terry, potentially leaving the defender in limbo well beyond the end of the season. The captain could point to the apparent inconsistency in policy given Branislav Ivanovic has recently signed new terms for next season, while the young centre-half Matt Miazga has been recruited from New York Red Bulls this month. Regardless, his dismay appears to have provoked him into going public with his belief his time at Stamford Bridge is drawing to a close.\nNo concrete offers are believed to be on the table as yet, but he is sure to attract interest from China \u2013 where he already has strong links having undertaken a one-man promotional tour last summer \u2013 the Gulf and Major League Soccer. Terry has made it clear he will not consider a move to a rival English club, and may even opt not to pursue a move to a European team.\nChelsea\u2019s search for a long-term successor to Mourinho is hampered by the reality the club do not yet know whether they will be able to offer Champions League football. While Diego Simeone at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid would be their preferred candidate, the merits of a number of candidates \u2013 including Antonio Conte, Massimiliano Allegri, Mark Hughes and even Eddie Howe and Claudio Ranieri have been discussed.\nThe club have indicated in a statement, issued late on Sunday night, that they do not consider Terry certain to depart the club in the summer. \u201cJohn requested a meeting with the club the week before last,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cIn that meeting he asked about the possibility of an extension to his existing contract.

From the moment Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano arrived as director of football and chief executive respectively, their aim was to appoint the man with whom they had achieved such success at Barcelona.\nWhile Manchester United flounder in the post-Ferguson, post-Gill world, with a manager \u2013 Louis van Gaal \u2013 who was the most sought-after in the world 20 years ago and an expensive and largely incomprehensible transfer policy, City can congratulate themselves on their long-term planning. Or at least they can if it works. A four-year battle to get a manager to sign a three-year contract will have been worth it if it establishes City as part of the European elite, whether through consistent success or because of the style of football they play \u2013 or, ideally, both. And Guardiola, at the very least, will guarantee interesting football with his radical tactical approach and his meticulous manipulation of his side from the touchline.\nManchester City to give Pep Guardiola \u00a3150m to spend on players Read more\nBut there is something more. In their statement when Robert Mancini was ousted in 2013 \u2013 and we now know that there had been talks between the club and Guardiola before that \u2013 City spoke of their desire for a \u201cholistic approach\u201d. That remains the goal and that is why so much money has been spent on the academy. In his book Goal \u2013 the Ball Doesn\u2019t Go in By Chance, Soriano talks of the importance of a club having an overarching philosophy, something that informs everything it does.\nOn the most practical footballing level, that means having youth players learning a style of play that is practised by the first team, facilitating their progress through the ranks. It was partly because of his perceived willingness to promote youth (and his rival\u2019s perceived unwillingness) that Guardiola was appointed ahead of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to the Barcelona job in 2008. When it works, when a great generation emerges together as happened at Bar\u00e7a, a mutual understanding honed over years means that the level reached is arguably higher than anything that can be achieved by off-the-shelf purchases.\nThe danger is that the environment becomes so rarefied that outsiders struggle to adapt, something that happened most obviously with Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Bar\u00e7a. Guardiola, though, has shown at Bayern that he is capable of adapting the purist passing style he oversaw at Bar\u00e7a; although he has won less at Bayern he has probably proved himself a more rounded coach there.\nIt might also be asked quite how a personality as driven and domineering as Guardiola\u2019s fits into Soriano\u2019s holistic vision. His demand for control, something reflected in his touchline persona, has been a major issue at Bayern, with constant spats with various club functionaries, most notably the doctors. City, it is true, is a club with fewer established interests than Bayern but if their planning is as careful and as predicated long-term as it appears, it makes no sense to fall under a cult of personality.\nPep Guardiola: Five heading for City exit and five who could flourish | Jamie Jackson Read more\nFor all City\u2019s fine talk of holism, many of their recent signings have not worked. Eight of the players who started against Napoli in City\u2019s first ever Champions League game in September 2011 are still first-team regulars \u2013 and that is despite a net spend of \u00a3235m. Raheem Sterling and Kevin De Bruyne have settled rather better than many of their predecessors and probably have a place in the medium-term future but this still seems some way off being a Guardiola squad.\nAt Bar\u00e7a he had Xavi and at Bayern he has Philipp Lahm, dominant figures blessed with profound football intelligence. There is no obvious equivalent at City nor even a player with the sort of understanding of space demonstrated by David Alaba or Thomas M\u00fcller. Sergio Ag\u00fcero, quick, mobile and deadly, presumably will have a role, as will David Silva with his incisiveness. Vincent Kompany, once his calf heals, will be valuable for his leadership as much as anything else. A better passer alongside him in the heart of the defence may be necessary, though.\nGuardiola ended up selling Yaya Tour\u00e9 when he was at Bar\u00e7a and the Ivorian is older and slower now. Tour\u00e9\u2019s future at City may have been in doubt anyway this summer; with Guardiola\u2019s arrival it seems likely he will leave \u2013 particularly after his agent Dimitri Seluk questioned Guardiola\u2019s abilities last month. Fernandinho may just about fit a Guardiola model; Fernando and Fabian Delph probably will not. The centre of midfield looks an obvious place for investment.\nThe move is important not only for City but also for Guardiola\u2019s legacy. \u201cMaybe I will go to a country where a kitman can be coach and win the title,\u201d Mourinho said after leading Chelsea to the title last season. \u201cMaybe I need to be smarter but I still enjoy these difficulties.\u201d The target of his jibe was fairly obvious: by going to Bayern, a club that had won the treble under Jupp Heynckes in the season before his arrival, Guardiola was taking over a dominant force.\nThat is not to say that he does not deserve credit for his successes at Bayern, particularly given the sophisticated and thrilling nature of some of the football they have played under him, but equally if Bayern do not win the Champions League this season there would be a sense that his three seasons there had in some way fallen short.\nEven if Guardiola does bring the Champions League, the thought will always be that success at Bayern could have been achieved by far lesser managers. Bayern\u2019s dominance \u2013 and the latest Deloitte report into football finance shows their revenues for 2014-15 were 69% higher than the next wealthiest German side, Borussia Dortmund \u2013 has slightly masked the rebuilding job Guardiola had to do when he succeeded Frank Rijkaard at Barcelona in 2008. Managing City is a far greater examination; there are far fewer guarantees of success. It may be true that, with the backing of Sheikh Mansour, City have greater resources to draw on than any other Premier League club, but in terms of revenue they lag behind United with three other English sides in the top nine.\nWhen Van Gaal described the Premier League as a \u201crat race\u201d, this is what he meant. This season has suggested that the middle-classes have risen (17 of the 30 sides with the highest revenues in the world in 2014-15 are in the Premier League) and that may make the league even more relentless than before.\nThe biggest question is whether Guardiola can sustain the intensity of his football over a full English season. That is a concern not only for players asked to press, but also, given his ferocity on the touchline, for Guardiola.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T18:54:15", "author": "Jonathan Wilson", "lang": "en", "topic": "Pep Guardiola|Sportblog|Manchester City|features", "category": "football", "title": "Pep Guardiola must realise Manchester City\u2019s dream of joining the European elite", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Pep Guardiola will bring radical change to the Etihad but the key question is whether he can sustain the intensity of his football over a full English season"},

Wenger ruled out a move for the 35-year-old but said he had been a symbol of Chelsea\u2019s strength in recent years.\n\u201cHe was not only a great player, he certainly still is, but he was also a great coach on the pitch,\u201d said Wenger. \u201cI saw him here once at London Colney playing with the Under-21s and the way he coached the team as a player was absolutely marvellous. He was a real leader and he had a great career as well, let\u2019s not forget that.\n\u201cThat\u2019s never a coincidence. The guys who last such a long time have something special. He was the symbol of cohesion inside Chelsea\u2019s club because him, [Frank] Lampard, [Didier] Drogba and [Petr] Cech were the players who carried the club\u2019s values for long periods. When you lose players like that you\u2019re always in danger. I see a coaching career in his future, certainly. He will remain in football, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u201cThe problem of our job and for the players is that it [careers in football] stops very early in your life.

I\u2019m confronted with many generations of players who after their career have that problem.\u201d\nAsked if he would consider a deal for Terry if he leaves Chelsea, Wenger added: \u201cNo, because he is at the end of his career and he has spent his career at Chelsea.

It was just before half-time in the match that had been declared \u201chalf the league title\u201d, 94,990 people were watching and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid were 2-1 down to Barcelona at the Camp Nou. Now, they were a man down as well, the defender heading to the press room, where he watched the rest of the game. As for Messi, he was OK. What is this? The End.\nIt was supposed to be, anyway \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t, not yet. Asked about Filipe Lu\u00eds\u2019s challenge \u2013 studs up, straight on to Messi\u2019s knee \u2013 Luis Enrique admitted he\u2019d been \u201cscared\u201d. He wasn\u2019t the only one and that wasn\u2019t the only time. The worry never entirely went away, concern gripping in the last minute as the goalkeeper Jan Oblak went up for a free-kick. When the referee blew a moment later, a 2-1 victory finally secured, there was relief for Barcelona. Diego Simeone stood on the touchline waiting to congratulate all of his players. They were two short but still Bar\u00e7a had suffered. \u201cThey were scared against nine men,\u201d insisted the Atl\u00e9tico striker Yannick Carrasco.\nBarcelona hold off nine-man Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to climb clear in La Liga Read more\n\u201cIn football you can win, draw or lose. If we have to lose, I would like it to always be like that,\u201d Simeone said. He called his team \u201camazing\u201d. It took only nine minutes for them to open the scoring, after Sa\u00fal had rolled Jordi Alba from a throw-in to find Koke running in. Perhaps more significantly, it took less than two minutes for them to have their first shot, Claudio Bravo diving to push away Sa\u00fal\u2019s curler, and more than two and a half minutes for the ball to even enter their half. A pattern had been set. Barcelona could not find a way out, pushed so deep that the passes \u2013 when they were completed at all \u2013 almost went sideways along the byline and back again.\nThe buses have been reversed off the goal-line, peep-peeping. Barcelona have been confronted by a different tactical problem lately. Like M\u00e1laga and Athletic Bilbao before them, Atl\u00e9tico decided not to wait but to seek Barcelona out, closing off the avenues from the back. Carrasco joined Antoine Griezmann, targeting players and chasing them down while behind those two the rest of Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s players moved up in formation. It is not really what Atl\u00e9tico do but they had been preparing this all week.\n\u201cWith 4-3-3 you can\u2019t really do it but 4-4-2 allows you to,\u201d Simeone explained. \u201cWe wanted to annoy Busquets and force Piqu\u00e9 and Mascherano to be the ones with the ball, then be aggressive in winning it. It\u2019s not easy to do but with Carrasco loose [closing them], we did. For 26 minutes we had speed, play and pushed them back.\u201d\nBarcelona did not know where to begin; the team that prefers to build was denied its foundations. Messi came back deeper to take responsibility and he, too, was pressed; twice in two minutes he gave the ball away. Luis Enrique called the start \u201cstrange\u201d. Then on 30 minutes Messi scored the equaliser and eight minutes after that Luis Su\u00e1rez made it 2-1, his goal a mix of the one that won last season\u2019s cl\u00e1sico and the one that put Barcelona 1-0 up at Mestalla before Christmas. Next, Filipe Lu\u00eds took out Messi, earning the first of two red cards about which no one could complain \u2013 not that it stopped some in the media, of course.\nNow, if 4-4-2 allows you to pressure, 4-4-1 should not but The End did not come with Filipe Lu\u00eds\u2019s red card; it did not come with Diego God\u00edn\u2019s red card in the 66th minute, either; and it did not even come when Augusto Fern\u00e1ndez was wheeled off the pitch 10 minutes after that, kissed on his way by his countryman Javier Mascherano.\nAfter 55 minutes, with the score at 2-1 and Atl\u00e9tico down to 10 men, the best chance of the game fell to Griezmann six yards out \u2013 only for Claudio Bravo to somehow save his header with his feet. Atl\u00e9tico had begun the second half like they had begun the first, despite the man disadvantage. Even when God\u00edn was sent off for a wild and unnecessary challenge on Su\u00e1rez, taking Atl\u00e9tico down to nine, not so much shooting themselves in the foot as blowing it to bits with a blunderbuss, Barcelona did not end it \u2013 and not only because they were wasting countless chances, either. They weren\u2019t: both teams had four shots on target, the total reading 10-7. When Oblak took off up the pitch, a draw was plausible.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Diego Simeone takes his place in the dugouts at the Camp Nou. Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of what we did, even with eight [outfield] players,\u201d Simeone said. \u201cEven with eight players, we caused them problems right to the end.\u201d Asked if he had anything to reproach his players for \u2013 after all, it was natural to ask what might have happened with 11 men \u2013 he shot back: \u201cNo. Absolutely nothing.\u201d Sa\u00fal added: \u201cI am proud of my team; we leave here with our heads held high.\u201d\nMarca insisted: \u201cAtl\u00e9tico died with their boots on\u201d and called it an \u201cexhibition of self-esteem, intensity and football\u201d. AS\u2019s front cover ran on: \u201cAtl\u00e9tico deserved more.\u201d El Pa\u00eds lead on: \u201cAtletico play, Barcelona win.\u201d Its match report opened with the line: \u201cEven though Barcelona won, people will talk about Atl\u00e9tico\u201d. They did, too, and rightly so.\nWhere there was talk about Barcelona, meanwhile, it focused mostly on what they did wrong. Marca called them \u201cpassive\u201d and \u201cunrecognisable\u201d, while Mascherano admitted they did not play well. They have played every three days since returning after the Club World Cup and that will continue into March. They look fatigued \u2013 or as if they are conserving energy aware that fatigue may follow \u2013 and Marca was wrong to call them \u201cunrecognisable\u201d: some flaws were familiar.\nYet, there was no escaping that first line: Barcelona won. It did not end when many thought, they had suffered more than most expected but when the final whistle went they had won. Just as they had won their last two games against M\u00e1laga and Athletic. Just as they have now won eight in a row and have gone 26 games without defeat, leaving them two games off the record set by Pep Guardiola\u2019s team. Tiredness may have taken them but, in terms of results, this is their best January since the six-trophy season in 2009.\nThere were other elements, too, more positive ones. When they were under pressure, Gerard Piqu\u00e9 was superb again, holding them together: too often his value to his team goes unrecognised. If others lost the ball, he did not. Messi dropping deeper spoke of responsibility and there were four tackles as well, while he also scored the equaliser when he somehow found space in an area populated by nine opponents. Su\u00e1rez scored his 30th goal in 31 games and is the league\u2019s top scorer. Dani Alves produced his 99th La Liga assist. He made the second; Alba made the first. Both goals were brilliant, both were made in very different ways.\nLuis Enrique praised his team\u2019s \u201ccapacity to suffer and come through it\u201d. Put under pressure, Barcelona still sought to play but they are a team who can release quicker and longer, too, as Alves\u2019s wonderful pass for Su\u00e1rez\u2019s second showed. Even if it was brief, even if the failure to kill off the game will cause concern, when they reacted in the first half they did play very well: the speed and precision of the passing was impressive. For all the talk of the red cards, they turned it around against 11 men \u2013 not 10 or nine \u2013 and not just any men either: Simeone\u2019s men.\nTwenty-two weeks into the league season, Atl\u00e9tico have let in more than a solitary goal in only two La Liga games: both of them against Barcelona. Luis Enrique\u2019s side have now scored 44.44% of the goals that Atl\u00e9tico have conceded all year.\n\u201cSometimes it seems like when you don\u2019t win 4-0, it\u2019s dreadful, when nothing could be further from the truth,\u201d Luis Enrique insisted. \u201cThis is football and they\u2019re not machines. This is a very, very good result against a very good team.\u201d With just under half the season remaining, it is far from conclusive but it is significant. It did not end with the red card but it did end with a Barcelona victory. They had just won a game that was, as the headlines had it, \u201chalf a league\u201d. Small wonder Sport cheered: \u201cBarcelona smell like champions.\u201d\nIt hadn\u2019t been easy but Barcelona won again, climbing three points and head-to-head goal difference above Atl\u00e9tico, four points and head-to-head above Madrid, and with a game in hand. \u201cThe league\u2019s not over,\u201d Luis Enrique said. \u201cThe league\u2019s not over,\u201d Zinedine Zidane said. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d\nSimeone agreed: \u201cBut this lot don\u2019t slip up often.\u201d\nTalking points\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gary Neville\u2019s Valencia face Barcelona in the Copa del Rey semi-finals this week.

This weekend, they were beaten 1-0 by Sporting Gij\u00f3n.\nThey have now gone 11 league games without a win \u2013 the longest winless run in the division \u2013 and Gary Neville is yet to win in the league, although his side are in the Copa del Rey semi-final against Barcelona this week. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to that,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, so are Barcelona,\u201d remarked AS\u2019s Juanma Trueba.\n\u201cYou ask how I explain that game,\u201d Neville said after the defeat. \u201cI find it difficult, sat there with some of the players and the coaching staff, for15 minutes trying to understand what has actually happened out there. It\u2019s the most disappointing result of the season but that does not tell the story of the game. This is not a game we should have lost.\u201d It\u2019s not, no, but they did. \u00c1lvaro Negredo is still a baffling striker at times, sometimes brilliant, sometimes \u2026 well, not. He missed three great chances and hit the post. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it. This was a game to have won four or five-one,\u201d Neville said, rightly.\nAsked about his position, Neville replied: \u201cI find that question ridiculous.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cCome on presidente, let us play: we\u2019re not Maradona.\u201d So said Espanyol\u2019s Burgui in the buildup to his team\u2019s visit to the Bernab\u00e9u to face Real Madrid \u2013 the club that he and Marco Asensio belong to. Madrid had imposed another of those crapping-yourself clauses that for some reason the league allows, even though they adulterate the competition, so Espanyol were without six starters, two of them loanees from Madrid. Even if they had played \u2013 and had been Maradona \u2013 it might not have prevented what felt like the inevitable walloping. Can we play you every week? Three up after quarter of an hour, for the second time this season Madrid put six past Espanyol. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick to take him level with Luis Su\u00e1rez at the top of the Pichichi chart, the second of them superb. He has 19 goals in the league, 42.1% of them against Espanyol.\nReal Madrid\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo scores hat-trick in demolition of Espanyol Read more\n\u2022 K\u00e9vin Gameiro wasn\u2019t hanging around.

It\u2019s so ugly that I won\u2019t repeat it. There are limits that should not be crossed!!\n2) As a colleague, a fellow professional and for the good of football, you cannot spend 90 minutes provoking [people] constantly, running up close to them. Just because someone puts a hand on your chest [you can\u2019t] pretend you have been attacked, Aduriz, to try to get someone sent off. That\u2019s part of the footballer\u2019s code, too; that football as wiped out years ago but, of course, here in Spain they call it being smart.\n3) Football is a contact sport. Today you can say that Aduriz won the other football and he was clever in faking \u2026 all this is sad!!\nFinally, it\u2019s good to be polite: congratulations to Athletic Bilbao for the three points and, yes, Aduriz is a great player, even if he didn\u2019t score today!!\nPS.

Pellegrini said: \u201cBefore I finish, I want to tell you I have talked with the club and I will finish my contract on the original date. I signed for one year more [to July 2017], but with the clause that the club or me can choose not to use that stuff now, so I finish here on the original date, 30 June, so there is not the speculation.\n\u201cThe club are not doing anything behind me, I knew this one month ago, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to have rumour or speculation about these things, so I prefer to finish today, which I why I have told the players and I have told the press.

It was the way in which the captain laboured his point, while also suggesting the hierarchy had \u201csaid that, when the new manager comes in, things might change but it\u2019s a \u2018no\u2019 at the minute.\u201d. There, unmistakeably, was his get-out should this tale take another twist. At present, anything feels possible. Maybe an offer is on the table, most likely from the Chinese Super League who appear so intent upon plundering the Premier League this winter, which Terry hopes Chelsea will come close to matching. Perhaps, now he has entered the final six months of his contract at Stamford Bridge and is permitted to negotiate a summer Bosman move to a foreign club, this is all a lavish game to coax a reaction from the club where he has spent the last 18 years as a professional. Certainly the timing felt rather odd. That Chelsea were compelled to issue their own statement late on Sunday night suggested they too had been taken by surprise by the centre-back\u2019s outburst, with damage limitation underway given the reception that might await at Watford on Wednesday night. By the end of Sunday that instinctive reading of Terry\u2019s comments \u2013 all anguished regret and resignation that his time at this club is drawing to a close \u2013 did not seem quite so clear-cut. Doubt is already creeping in \u2013 a parting of the ways may not be inevitable \u2013 fuelled by hints a new manager might want a say on whether a player with 700 career club games to his name should be discarded. The key now is the speed with which either party makes their next move: does Terry sign elsewhere, do the club stick or twist?

The Arsenal manager was well aware that after the fifth-round weekend his team play Barcelona on Tuesday, 23 February, in the Champions League last 16, first leg. His prayers were answered when his club pulled the Championship leaders, Hull City, at home. It will be the third season in succession Arsenal have faced Hull and they have won each of the previous meetings \u2013 most famously, the 2014 final, which was an extra-time thriller. It did, though, raise the general question about Arsenal\u2019s ability to fight on three fronts and Wenger, who is now without only three players \u2013 Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshere and Santi Cazorla \u2013 was bullish. \u201cIf we can keep everybody fit, we can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cAgainst Burnley, I rested Monreal, Bellerin, Ramsey, Walcott, \u00d6zil, Mertesacker of course [who was suspended]. Barcelona will play as well on the weekend before the tie.\u201d David Hytner\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kelechi Iheanacho of Manchester City performs an overhead kick Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images\n3) Garde was probably right to focus on the league\nMany would say Aston Villa are down already and watching their listless display against Manchester City students of body language would find it hard to disagree. Yet R\u00e9mi Garde admitted afterwards he had made a few changes with the next couple of league games in mind, and looking at the fixture list it is not difficult to see why. Villa\u2019s fate could be determined this week. They have a home game against West Ham on Tuesday and a visit to Norwich at the weekend. They need to win both. If they do they can at least stay in touch with the other relegation candidates; if they don\u2019t their crisis of confidence will continue into a difficult run of opponents that include Liverpool, Everton, Stoke, Manchester City and Tottenham. So, Villans, no pressure or anything but this is the week to get going. Points from anywhere else are likely to arrive too late. Paul Wilson\n4) Liverpool\u2019s armband rotation allows Klopp to show faith\nLiverpool\u2019s goalless draw against West Ham was notable only for young players overshadowing more experienced team-mates, Darren Randolph\u2019s commanding display in the visitors\u2019 goal and more complaints from J\u00fcrgen Klopp about replays and the fixture list. It did, however, provide another example of the Liverpool manager\u2019s belief that responsibility should be accepted throughout the squad as Joe Allen became the seventh player to captain the side during Klopp\u2019s 26 matches in charge. Brendan Rodgers frequently bemoaned an absence of leadership in his team, often justifiably so, but \u2013 as with his trust in young players to handle Premier League opposition at home in the FA Cup \u2013 Klopp has given his players an opportunity to address that concern. For Allen, who is out of contract at the end of next season, the armband was a timely show of faith from his manager. In answer to the inevitable question Klopp\u2019s other Liverpool captains have been Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Lucas Leiva, Kolo Tour\u00e9, Christian Benteke and Jos\u00e9 Enrique. Andy Hunter\n5) Iturbe can learn from Howe history lesson\nJuan Iturbe\u2019s move from Roma to Bournemouth on loan was one of the more eye-catching deals of the transfer window. A \u00a316m purchase from Verona in June 2014 the 22-year-old, who has played one friendly for Paraguay but has since declared his allegiance to his homeland Argentina, made a promising start in the Italian capital but quickly drifted to the fringes. Iturbe showed glimpses of his quality amidst the huff and puff of the victory against Portsmouth, particularly with a powerful shot that Ryan Fulton did brilliantly to tip on to the post in the first half, but his manager knows there is potentially plenty more to come. \u201cThe first half wasn\u2019t something he was maybe used to. Juan\u2019s talent is not in doubt, he\u2019s an outstanding player. I still feel there\u2019s an adjustment from our perspective to get the best out of him.\u201d That\u2019s not all Howe will do to make him feel at home. Bournemouth\u2019s captain, Tommy Elphick, revealed new signings are given a club history lesson by the manager when they join. Since Howe has spent almost half of his life at the club, Iturbe would do well to listen. Ed Aarons\n6) Colchester\u2019s excellent youth system poses questions\nIf, as seems increasingly likely, Colchester United are a League Two side next season they stand to be the only club in the bottom tier with a Category Two academy. The club have invested sizeable sums in their youth operation, largely at the expense of their first-team budget, and the results are obvious both in a visit to their training ground and a look at the squad that faced Tottenham Hotspur. Alex Gilbey, an imposing central midfielder who looks cut out for a move higher up the leagues, caught the eye in particular and it is heartening to see another lower-division club follow the development model that Crewe Alexandra continue to embrace so wholeheartedly. It is getting harder and harder: a Category Two operation costs little short of seven figures annually \u2013 that is a commitment beyond most below the Championship and some in it. It is easy to understand the concerns many clubs share that, for all the rhetoric about benefiting the English game, the Elite Player Performance Plan has turned out to be little more than a carve-up designed to garland a select few. Colchester are exceptional at what they do and the hope is that they will reap the rewards further down the line; they seem a more logical starting point for a young player than many of the serial hoarders further up the chain and it is just a shame that the system makes it so difficult for other clubs of their standing, many of which have impressive histories of youth development, to work similarly. Nick Ames\n7) Proximity of goals\u2019 target can help Rooney and United\nManchester United have developed a habit of pulling out a result or two whenever a full-blown crisis appears to be developing and that was certainly the thought after what turned into a comfortable win over Derby. United were good value for the win and it cannot go unnoticed that Wayne Rooney, whose excellent first-half goal was his sixth in as many games, seems to be growing in confidence by the week. Rooney, now six goals short of Bobby Charlton\u2019s club record, has scored 13 goals in a difficult campaign. United have, away from home at least, shown a few signs of packing a greater punch this month and a revitalised Rooney can only bring out the best in team-mates such as Anthony Martial and Juan Mata, both of whom put in encouraging performances at the iPro Stadium. There are greater tests to come but perhaps the proximity of bettering Charlton\u2019s tally will \u2013 consciously or not \u2013 give Rooney that extra impetus to pull United round.

Photograph: Matthew Peters/Man Utd via Getty Images\n8) Can Su\u00e1rez live up to his namesake\u2019s reputation?\nCompletion of the signing of Mario Su\u00e1rez, following that of Nordin Amrabat and Costel Pantilimon, means Watford\u2019s supporters can be quietly pleased with the business done during the January transfer window. If rumours are to be believed they missed out on Andros Townsend but the \u00a312m paid by Newcastle for the former Spurs winger represents questionable value, certainly in comparison to the total of \u00a310m paid for Amrabat and Su\u00e1rez. According to Watford\u2019s manager, Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, Su\u00e1rez turned down an offer from Valencia to sign a four-and-a-half-year deal at Vicarage Road, and it seems clear their relationship dating from a year together at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid was a key factor. Flores described Su\u00e1rez as a \u201cpivot\u201d and if he can, as he put it, \u201crecuperate\u201d the player, the midfielder will join the likes of his namesake Luis as one of those January signings who prove outstanding business can be done in mid-season. Richard Rae\n9) Pitch quality is no longer the great leveller\nGraham Westley has an interesting theory about why there are fewer victories for underdogs compared to previous eras: the lack of bad pitches. \u201cOne of the things that has changed from years gone by is pitches are no longer the levelling aspect,\u201d he said after Peterborough\u2019s 2-2 draw at West Brom. \u201cPitches at all levels are better and therefore quality gets more time to shine. When Wrexham beat Arsenal [in 1992], you look at the pitch that day and it made it difficult for highly technical players to get a result. Technical players have a chance to shine wherever and perhaps that\u2019s a factor. Top-level players are top-level players for a reason. Lower-level players are lower-level players for a reason.\u201d Westley was keen to stress his team are no ordinary bunch of lower-league players, though. \u201cThe only difference with us is that we have young players who are recruited because they are the best young players in the lower leagues and go on to higher levels. Our players cannot be underestimated\u201d Alan Smith\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jon Taylor of Peterborough United celebrates scoring his team\u2019s second goal with manager Graham Westley. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images\n10) Oxford deserve every success in attempts to provide closure\nNamed after the former club chairman Firoz Kassam, who still owns it, there is something slightly odd about the Kassam Stadium, home of Oxford United since they moved from the Manor Ground in 2001. Odd in the fact that it is home to as impressive a statue of a muscular bronze ox as you\u2019re ever likely to see, but nobody appears to have noticed that they\u2019re missing a fourth stand. The upshot? Well, quite apart from the fact that it leaves the windscreens of cars parked too near one end susceptible to damage from wayward shots, the absence of that all-important \u201cfourth wall\u201d, while to be encouraged in theatre circles, just makes an otherwise fine stadium look downright unfinished and a little bit weird. In a match that generated few talking points, let\u2019s not pretend this is one of extreme urgency, but under Michael Appleton Oxford appear to be a team that is going places. Should they ascend to the Championship in the next few seasons, as is his stated intention, here\u2019s hoping they can buy the stadium from its current owner, overcome any legal difficulties involving the local council and achieve closure in every sense of the word. Barry Glendenning\n11) One incident should not obscure a special occasion\nLeague Two Carlisle United\u2019s 3-0 fourth round defeat to Everton should be remembered for the indomitable effort of those Cumbrians who somehow, and against all odds, enabled the club to get this game on in the wake of the devastation inflicted on Brunton Park and the surrounding area by December\u2019s floods. Then there was a wonderful performance from Everton\u2019s Ross Barkley and the beautiful, elegant, simplicity of Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s team\u2019s football. Most of the headlines concentrated on an isolated incident of alleged racist abuse directed towards Arouna Kon\u00e9 and Steven Pienaar after Kon\u00e9 scored the opening goal. It is right there should be zero tolerance towards such behaviour and Carlisle dealt with the matter very well, issuing a public address announcement stressing this was not on. It should not be allowed to obscure the generally generous spirited atmosphere of the home crowd who offered Barkley a splendid standing ovation when he was substituted. As Mart\u00ednez put it: \u201cCarlisle United deserve incredible credit for getting the game on. They\u2019ve given us all a lesson of how to face adversity in life and football.\u201d", "date_time": "2016-02-01T08:35:47", "author": "Guardian Sport", "lang": "en", "topic": "FA Cup|Ten talking points from this weekend's action|West Bromwich Albion|Peterborough|Arsenal|Burnley|Colchester|blogposts", "category": "football", "title": "FA Cup: talking points from the fourth round", "source": "guardian", "intro": "John Terry\u2019s dramatic revelation about his Chelsea career may not be the final word, R\u00e9mi Garde was probably right to focus on the league and Wayne Rooney continues to draw inspiration from Bobby Charlton"},

But Gervinho aside there is a hitherto unremarkable mid-table club chasing Zlatan Ibrahimovic and paying Chelsea over $30m for Ramires and a second division team paying $11m for a young Chinese player. China is set to become the biggest non-European league in the world in the not-too-distant future, overtaking the likes of MLS, Mexico and any other you may care to mention.\nThe really big names that can be tempted to leave Europe often go to MLS \u2013 Beckham, Lampard, Henry, Gerrard, Kaka and Pirlo \u2013 but China is increasingly able to pay big money (often too big at the moment but that is due to necessity more than naivety) for players that are not quite so stellar but are usually much closer to their prime. Guangzhou have Ricardo Goulart, still only 24 and regarded as one of the top Brazilian prospects a year ago when he left Cruzerio, while Beijing Guoan has Renato Augusto one of four players from Brazilian champions Corinthians to make a recent move to China. East Asia is still a relative culture shock for players based in South America or Europe than North America but a growing number of Chinese clubs can offer huge salaries with Renato Augusto more than quadrupling his. The US transfer system can be complex with plenty of rules and regulations. In China, it\u2019s naked capitalism. There\u2019s lots of money and lots of people happy to see that cash buying players from overseas.\nJackson Mart\u00ednez completes Guangzhou Evergrande move from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid Read more\nIn terms of attendances, MLS and China are similar but perhaps not for long. The 2016 Super League season, set to kick off in March, is the most eagerly-awaited yet. Last year saw an average attendance of just over 22,000, less than two hundred behind Italy and France. A high-ranking league official told the Guardian that this season will see the 25,000 barrier broken and predicts that by 2018, the Chinese Super League will be the third most-watched football league in terms of average attendance in the world behind the Bundesliga and the English Premier League. There\u2019s money, the political will, the infrastructure, the passion, the ambition and plenty of potential. Talk in Europe of whether the spending is sustainable is misguided. This is just one of many examples of the world\u2019s second largest economy flexing its financial muscles.\nIt is already having an effect at home. In 2015 Chinese broadcasters paid just $9m to show local league games. In 2016 it will be over $200m as part of a $1.25bn package over the next five seasons.\nGuangzhou Evergrande has become the prime mover in China after being taken over by a huge property developer. Five Chinese titles, two Asian Champions Leagues and two World Cup winning coaches later, the Cantonese giant wants to win the Fifa Club World Cup. With Robinho, Paulinho, Goulart, Luiz Felipe Scolari, much of the Chinese national team and an average attendance of over 45,000, it is already Asia\u2019s premier club.\nShanghai SIPG was runner-up in 2015 but Sven Goran Eriksson lost out once again to Scolari. The Swede has been spending big, paying around $50m for Ghanaian goal-king Asamoah Gyan and Brazilian striker Elkeson. The club still wants Robin van Persie or Wayne Rooney. Shanghai Shenhua has Demba Ba, Fredy Guarin and Tim Cahill. Beijing Guoan risks getting left behind but still had 42,000 applications for 27,000 season tickets earlier this month.\nBeijing has Serie A winning coach Alberto Zaccheroni in the hotseat and, as well as Scolari and Sven at Evergrande and SIPG, there\u2019s ex-Brazil boss Mano Menezes at Shandong Luneng and Dragan Stojkovic, not long ago tipped to be Arsene Wenger\u2019s Arsenal successor, with Guangzhou R&F. Whatever the past failings of the Chinese system, the country\u2019s best players are increasingly being coached by well-regarded international names.\nThe spending has been encouraged by a government headed by big soccer fan Xi Jinping. The president was tired of the world\u2019s most populous country continually failing at the world\u2019s most popular game. Wealthy businessmen get involved, in part, to curry favor and craft links with the politicians and even perhaps, to make money. Guangzhou may have spent over $150m on players and coaches since 2010 but Evergrande, who bought the club for $16m, sold 50% of it for $190m to internet giant Alibaba \u2013 just four years later.\nThere is still, of course, much work to be done to improve the standard of local players. As well as in terms of men\u2019s national teams, China lags behind the United States in a big way when it comes to participation. Soccer may be the most played sport among American youth but kids rarely play the game in the Middle Kingdom often due to a lack of places to play or the preference of parents to have their (usually only) offspring aim for a \u201creal\u201d job rather than professional football.\nThe government has launched a scheme to get kids playing football at school and the target in 2017 is to have 20,000 schools playing the sport on a weekly basis. This is set to be expanded in a big way. Guangzhou has built what is purported to be the biggest soccer academy in the world (helped by Real Madrid) and the fact that there is more money coming into the game \u2013 such as from the new television deal and increasing corporate interest \u2013 should feed through to local players further down the chain, making professional football an increasingly attractive option a decade from now. By that time, the league should be thriving.\nProducing more local talent would mean that the league would be less reliant on foreign stars, though the money is likely to be there regardless of any wider economic problems. It is debatable as to which league is the best outside Europe but whichever it is, China is catching fast. That may not matter much to fans in North America but is another sign that the balance of power is moving east along with Gervinho, Ramires and who knows who else?", "date_time": "2016-02-01T09:00:24", "author": "John Duerden", "lang": "en", "topic": "MLS|Sportblog|China|US sports|features", "category": "football", "title": "Why China, not MLS, is luring stars away from Europe", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Attendances and broadcast deals are rising in China as the government looks to build its homegrown talent too"},

The one when The Mill can kick back and let the rumours eat themselves as clubs emerge from the shadows to pounce on annoying transfer fluff that should really have blown away a long, long time ago. Hello Saido Berahino! Yes, the West Brom striker is still haunting the Hawthorns. But, hopefully, for the good of Berahino, Tony Pulis and idle gossip-mongers, not for too much longer. You see, Newcastle and Stoke are keen to throw far too much money at Jeremy Peace for the player. Steve McClaren has already lobbed in a bid of \u00a321m but the Baggies want \u00a325m for a red-hot forward who has scored three league goals this season and about whom Pulis has said: \u201cSaido has to realise he is a footballer \u2026 he has wasted three or four months. I\u2019m not picking him because he\u2019s not been anywhere near what he was last year.\u201d Despite this glowing review, Mauricio Pochettino, may still swing around into Berahino\u2019s view, arms out wide like a forgiving dad, and allow the striker to cry on his broad shoulders before becoming the new H\u00e9lder Postiga Jermain Defoe at Tottenham Hotspur.\nTransfer deadline day \u2013 live! Read more\nFor some reason or other Leicester City are prepared to throw \u00a37m the way of Crystal Palace for a striker who can\u2019t get into a team that can\u2019t score any goals and who has just dropped down the pecking order behind the footballer formerly known as Emmanuel Adebayor. Yes, Dwight Gayle, an energetic, pesky but woefully underused striker, has got Claudio Ranieri\u2019s lips quivering. We\u2019re not quite sure how, mind, as he hasn\u2019t played for the past two months but that what it says here. Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my is also on Ranieri\u2019s radar. Guus Hiddink can\u2019t find anything for him to do at Chelsea so he\u2019ll happily see him out of the Stamford Bridge exit door. But Watford, being a shorter journey for a player who never likes to bust a gut to get anywhere, may be his preferred choice and \u00a311.5m would be a very welcome addition in the Bank of Chelsea.\nLiverpool aren\u2019t prepared to be taken to the cleaners by Shakhtar Donetsk to secure the services of Alex Teixeira. They\u2019ve been told that the forward\u2019s buyout clause is not \u00a338m \u2013 and perhaps after Shahktar suits plucked the next figure from the wings of a fairy that was hovering by at the time \u2013 been quoted \u00a353.2m. Hmmm. So, what about a deal for Real Madrid\u2019s Denis Cheryshev then? Remember him? Yes, the cup curse himself. The left winger could sign just in time to tumble out of the FA Cup replay at West Ham. Zinedine Zidane is loading him into a cannon in anticipation of firing him out of the Bernab\u00e9u as we speak. \u201cCheryshev could leave. He\u2019s a great player but he needs to be playing regularly. The most important thing for him is that he gets minutes. He is a hard-working player and he needs to be building up playing time. I wish him the best. If he has the chance to leave, I\u2019d be delighted for him.\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp will have to tussle with Sevilla for the 25-year-old though. They also have the hots for him.\nDespite regularly dribbling out of defence like he\u2019s being controlled by a 12-year-old playing Fifa 16, John Stones is still going up in value like a three-bedroom house in north London. Apparently, Manchester City and Chelsea are willing to part with \u00a350m for the frisky centre-back, but expect any deal to take place in the summer, not in the next few minutes. Chelsea, for some reason or other, think he can replace the outgoing John Terry. As for City, well, if Pep turns up, he\u2019ll probably invent a new position for Stones in which defending isn\u2019t that important so perhaps that makes more sense. And while we\u2019re on the subject of Terry, New York City, LA Galaxy, Montreal Impact, Guangzhou Evergrande and Fenerbahce would quite like to snaffle the Brave One when he is allowed to leave Chelsea in the summer.\nFulham call off Moussa Demb\u00e9le\u2019s \u00a36m move to Tottenham over loan-back Read more\nHaving failed with his bid to add to Michu\u2019s painful journey over the past few years by bringing him to the Aston Villa pleasure dome, R\u00e9mi Garde will instead make the leftfield move of targeting a full-back, Mathieu Debuchy. Arsenal\u2019s forgotten man could make an initial loan move before escaping in the summer so that his career doesn\u2019t get tainted by playing in the Championship. Seydou Doumbia won\u2019t be going on loan to Aston Villa. The Roma striker would much rather join a relegation fight he has a chance of winning at Newcastle.\nRoberto Mart\u00ednez will attempt to bring Dynamo Kyiv attacking midfielder Andriy Yarmolenko and Locomotiv Moscow striker Oumar Niasse to Goodison Park.

No wonder, perhaps, that these camps once earned the disparaging nickname Camp Cupcake \u2013 with their air of \u201cprizes for participation\u201d.\nYet the wave of US internationals who returned to MLS during the last World Cup year has changed the balance and stakes of these camps, and with it the sense of expectation and possibility that comes from them. The majority of the senior core of the team now plays in MLS. Also, the likes of Geoff Cameron, Graham Zusi and Matt Besler and latterly, Gyassi Zardes, have all made breakthroughs at the January camps, and with World Cup qualifying having started, a vital Olympic playoff coming up, as well as the Centenary Copa America this summer, this particular edition of the January camps has had a very particular charge to it.\nAdd in the underwhelming 2015 performances by the US and Klinsmann, and there\u2019s been a definite imperative for this camp and the performances that come out of it to look more defined than the long noodling experiment of the post-World Cup 2014 period.\nUSA 3-2 Iceland | International friendly match report Read more\nA patchy 3-2 home win over Iceland is hardly a definitive turning of the page, but it\u2019s a start.

All of the players at this camp should be considered a realistic part of the picture for the 2018 World Cup. That said\u2026\n2) Nobody quite seized their chance\nIt took until the second half against Iceland for any debutants to make an impression \u2013 and when they did it was an Iceland player. Aron Sigurdarson was a lively presence and deserved his goal in the 48th minute, when he took advantage of a horrible lack of concentration from US players as they were caught ball-watching on a quickly taken Iceland free-kick.\nBefore that, various fringe US players had had largely anonymous days, with one or two moments they\u2019ll want to forget. The promising Dallas player Kellyn Acosta may have been deployed out of position as a full-back, but should still have done better with his own bout of ball-watching on the lead-up to Iceland\u2019s opener in the 13th minute, and Ethan Finlay looked serviceable rather than inspiring. Lee Nguyen did nothing particularly bad, without suggesting he\u2019s a long-term threat to Clint Dempsey.\nIn the second-half though, there were some intriguing cameos. Steven Birnbaum ended up scoring the winner with a well placed header, as well as an assist to help level the scores in the 59th minute. He had his share of blame for some lax defending from the US in the second-half, but his prowess on set pieces at the other end might have done enough to get him more minutes this Friday against Canada.\nMost impressive though was the urgency and movement that arrived with the introduction of Jerome Kiesewetter and Jordan Morris for the last 15 minutes of the game. Morris is no secret, and the newly minted Seattle player provided his familiar burst of intelligent movement in the final third \u2013 helping pin Iceland back just as they were beginning to cause the US problems. And Kiesewetter\u2019s speed and touch down the right suggested a fearless young player determined to seize his chance. He and Morris are said to enjoy playing together and it showed in their brief time on the field. And with nobody else truly making a compelling case, if Kiesewetter plays this Friday he has the chance to become the breakthrough player from the camp.\n3) The biggest center-back intrigue happened off the field\nThis weekend saw two significant center-back signings for Klinsmann\u2019s 2018 planning. Matt Miazga only got his chance in the New York Red Bulls team last year when an opening day injury to Ronald Zubar gifted him a run in the team. But by the end of 2015 he\u2019d transitioned rapidly through the US national team youth ranks to full international status, and by the last weekend of January 2016 he had signed for Chelsea \u2013 and absented himself from the national team camp to do so.\nMatt Miazga: Chelsea's pull proves too strong for Red Bulls' standout defender Read more\nAnd at the same time as Miazga was continuing his rapid ascent, John Brooks was signing a new contract with Hertha Berlin. Brooks is a young player who Klinsmann has given plenty of time to come good in the national side \u2013 to a degree that critics might call over-indulgence \u2013 and consolidating his toehold in German domestic soccer should keep him in his national team coach\u2019s favor.\nIn the absence of that pair, Michael Orozco and Matt Besler started against Iceland. Besler has been here before \u2013 becoming an unlikely starter at the World Cup alongside the talented but erratic Omar Gonzalez. Gonzalez himself was last seen being unveiled as Darth Vader by Pachuca, after finding himself on the outs at LA Galaxy during this off-season. Whether he has the tenacity to win back the golden boy position currently occupied by Miazga is just one of the center-back questions to ponder.\nOn the field itself, Besler and Orozco didn\u2019t do a lot to suggest they were going to make speculation about absent colleagues an irrelevance, despite Orozco getting a goal. Both were given the full 90 minutes to impress, and both failed, in a shaky US defensive performance. Klinsmann may be closer to his World Cup pairing at the back, but they weren\u2019t playing against Iceland.\n4) The midfield pivot is still an issue\nIt might seem churlish to complain about the midfield pivot in the 4-2-3-1 when said pivot has done what it was intended to do, and facilitated a man of the match performance from Michael Bradley.\nSo to accentuate the positive first \u2013 Bradley had another very good game against European opposition \u2013 helping his side to a third successive win over such opposition for the first time in 25 years. Bradley got into dangerous positions to act as playmaker, as well as providing his usual degree of danger from dead balls. Making him tick is always the USA\u2019s best hope of a result against quality opposition, and with Jermaine Jones performing the defensive duties, Bradley was able to play without the burden of responsibility that sometimes sees him spread too thin on the field.\nBut Jones will not be the starter in that position at the next World Cup, and nor will Kyle Beckerman, who performed a similar limited role at the last World Cup. It\u2019s arguably better to see Jones as a placeholder than it is seeing him be shoehorned into a center-back role, as Klinsmann has previously tried to do. And there\u2019s also a case to be made that after the let downs of last year, Klinsmann needed his most solid midfield platform in place to make sure of any kind of performance against Iceland, particularly with other new moving parts in place in front of them.\nBut there was something symbolic about watching Perry Kitchen agitating in vain on the sideline to try and make his substitute\u2019s appearance before the final whistle. In fairness Klinsmann had already given Tony Tchani a shot in lieu of Jones for the last 20 minutes, but there\u2019s a real feel of a developmental bottleneck at that position that needs to be resolved sooner rather than later. Klinsmann needs to commit to a long term replacement for Jones, or at least become more serious about who the contenders are. If he was watching at home you could have forgiven Dax McCarty, to name but one, for shaking his head in frustration. He, Tchani or Kitchen might not be the answer, but seeing Jones in this context told us nothing new.\n5) We missed a chance to see Darlington Nagbe shine\nDarlington Nagbe played for 29 minutes against Iceland, coming on as sub to play out wide. It was a fairly standard cameo appearance under Klinsmann \u2013 long enough to potentially do something, anything, but not quite playing the player where he can do what he does best.\nNagbe\u2019s not alone in being set a challenge like that by his international coach, but he\u2019s also one of the few players in the emerging generation of US players who has the potential to be a potent weapon if deployed correctly (ask Caleb Porter what switching Darlington Nagbe to the middle does for your team\u2026).\nOf course, the same claim might be made about Nguyen, who played 90 minutes against Iceland as the notional creator in the center, but Nguyen has not reached the heights of his 2014 season with New England of late, and did nothing to suggest he should either replace the aging Dempsey long-term, or remain ahead of Nagbe in the immediate future.\nIt was clear against Iceland that Nagbe wanted to come inside at every opportunity, and clear that not giving him the freedom to do so meant he never touched his potential. He was muted.\nHis long wait for citizenship roughly coincided with his club coach finally trusting him to play in the center of the field \u2013 a move that ended up being rewarded with Portland Timbers lifting MLS Cup, after a winning run inspired by a liberated Nagbe.\nKlinsmann\u2019s yet to make a similar leap of faith. Nagbe\u2019s in the national team picture, but for now, still too close to the edge of it.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T11:00:03", "author": "Graham Parker", "lang": "en", "topic": "USA|Sportblog|Jurgen Klinsmann|US sports|features", "category": "football", "title": "What we learned from USA v Iceland: Darlington Nagbe's missed opportunity", "source": "guardian", "intro": "January is often a time for the US to look at emerging players but no one seized the chance to impress J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann"},

{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/feb/01/serie-a-milan-win-derby-inter-lose-control", "content": "The Derby della Madonnina was preceded by a protest. As the minutes ticked down towards kick-off, a series of banners were unfurled at the red-and-black end of San Siro. \u201cYears later, we are still in the same state,\u201d read the message from Milan\u2019s supporters in the Curva Sud. \u201cA club cast adrift, with no ambition. A mediocre team with no champions. Today, just like back in the day, you win the derby by showing some balls.\u201d\nBuilding on that final thought, the same fans then unveiled a vast image of Mark Hateley, rising above Fulvio Collovati for a match-winning header against Internazionale in October 1984. The England striker experienced mixed fortunes in Italy, scoring a modest 17 goals in three Serie A seasons, but will always be remembered fondly by the Rossoneri for ending a sequence of five years without a derby win.\nMilan take the derby honours with 3-0 win over Internazionale Read more\nMilan needed a similar lift this weekend. They had beaten Inter just once in their last nine attempts, and trailed the Nerazzurri by eight points in the standings. Their recent form, admittedly, had been better than that of their neighbours, but Barbara Berlusconi told reporters on Thursday that the club\u2019s realistic ambition for this season was simply to get back into the Europa League.\nInter were setting their sights rather higher. League leaders at Christmas, they had recently slipped to fourth but not yet given up on the Scudetto. At the very least, they were intent on securing a Champions League berth, and had gone out and signed \u00c9der \u2013 joint-second in Serie A\u2019s scoring charts - from Sampdoria to further their cause.\nMilan 3-0 Internazionale: Serie A \u2013 as it happened Read more\nUnlike their Milan counterparts, Inter\u2019s supporters still had faith in their team. Despite a return of just five points from the last five games, a crowd of 300 or so Ultras from the Curva Nord turned out for an open training session on Saturday, armed with flares and flags. The new signing was celebrated with a banner that read \u2018Cr-Eder-ci\u2019, highlighting his name in the middle of the Italian word for \u2018believe\u2019. \u00c9der rewarded such enthusiasm with two goals in an intra-squad practice match. Roberto Mancini put the player straight into his starting XI to face Milan, lining him up just behind Stevan Jovetic in attack.\nJos\u00e9 Mourinho had pulled a similar stunt six-and-a-half years previously, inserting Wesley Sneijder into Inter\u2019s derby lineup one day after the Dutchman had arrived from Real Madrid. That proved to be a masterstroke, paving the way for a famous 4-0 win. And, who knows, perhaps \u00c9der would have gone on to enjoy a similarly happy introduction, if he had only managed to put his header on target when Juan Jesus picked him out with a fine cross in the sixth minute of Sunday\u2019s game.\nInstead it was Milan who got to celebrate an instance of history repeating. With 10 minutes left in the first-half, their Brazilian centre-back Alex rose like Hateley over Davide Santon to crash a header into the Inter net. The symbolism was lost on nobody, with even the league\u2019s official Twitter account posting photos of the two goals side by side. The only difference was that Alex had scored early; this left Inter with plenty of time to formulate a response. Their second-half introduction of Mauro Icardi threatened to turn the match on its head.\nSerie A TIM (@SerieA_TIM) #MilanInter Alex su Santon come Hateley su Collovati, la foto stampata sulla coreografia del @acmilan. Spettacolo. pic.twitter.com/kvkWZfYHsn\nThe Argentinian had been dropped to the bench as punishment for missing a sitter against Carpi in the previous league fixture, with Mancini claiming that even he could have put away such a chance despite being in his 50s. Relations between the manager and his leading scorer have appeared strained of late but Icardi was eventually sent on to replace the ineffectual Jovetic shortly after the hour mark.\nWithin five minutes, Icardi had carved out Inter\u2019s best chance of the match. He surged past Alex to reach an Adem Ljajic through-ball, before firing a vicious shot across goal. Milan\u2019s goalkeeper, Gigi Donnarumma, could only parry the ball straight back into Icardi\u2019s path.\nAlex, who had gone to ground in a failed attempt to block the initial effort, now raised a boot towards the striker\u2019s left calf. The contact looked minimal, and Icardi certainly made the most of it, but this was an extremely ill-judged challenge. Already booked, the defender could count himself lucky not to receive a second yellow card after referee Antonio Damato signalled for the penalty.\nA further reprieve was to follow. Icardi stepped up to take the spot-kick, but clanged his shot against the right-hand post. The mistake was compounded moments later, when Carlos Bacca converted M\u2019Baye Niang\u2019s cross to double Milan\u2019s lead. Niang himself then put the result beyond doubt, forcing the ball home at the second attempt after he was played in by Giacomo Bonaventura. Barely eight minutes after Icardi blew his chance to make the score 1-1, Inter instead found themselves 3-0 down. They could summon no further response.\nAnd so, the team whose fans had begun the day with a protest finished it celebrating their best derby win for years. To an extent, fortune had favoured Milan: besides the Icardi miss, one might also consider that Niang was supposed to be on his way to Leicester last week. The Premier League club, after making enquiries, eventually opted against going through with a deal.\nBut Milan have also been better at getting results lately. They have lost only once since the defeat to Juventus in November, and have shown well in the big games, drawing away to Roma before beating Fiorentina 2-0. Their football has rarely looked fluid but with Bacca in such ruthless form it has not needed to be. He has scored with 11 of his 21 shots on target this season.\nAnd for all the talk of reduced ambitions, Milan are a lot closer to the Champions League places than you might expect. Victory drew them to within five points of Inter, and to within six of third-placed Fiorentina.\nSinisa Mihajlovic had billed this derby as \u201can elevator\u201d, explaining that: \u201cThe winner goes up, and the loser comes crashing down to earth.\u201d If that sounds more like Disneyland\u2019s Tower of Terror than any lift that I would counsel you to get in, it is nevertheless true that Inter appear dangerously close to freefall.\nSent off for excessive protests early in the second half, Mancini flipped the bird at Milan supporters as he headed for the tunnel, and lost his temper again during a subsequent TV interview. Asked by Mediaset\u2019s Mikaela Calcagno whether his comments about Icardi\u2019s miss against Carpi might have put extra pressure on the striker, Mancini accused her of talking \u201cbullshit\u201d.\nWhen she followed up by asking whether he had indeed sworn at fans, he replied \u201cI showed my middle finger to some who were insulting me and shouldn\u2019t have been there, given that we have stewards. There, are you happy?\u201d He later apologised, but actions will speak louder than words from here.\nThe concern is that Mancini\u2019s loss of temper reflected his own feelings of losing control with his team. This was the second game in a row, following the midweek Coppa Italia defeat to Juventus, in which Inter have conceded three goals. Jeison Murillo, who fell flat on his face in the buildup to Milan\u2019s third, is struggling badly, and a recent inability to keep clean sheets is only highlighting how turgid the team\u2019s attacking play has been all season.\nPerhaps \u00c9der will help to put Inter back on track in the weeks ahead. But he will not soon be able to wipe away the memory of such a demoralising derby defeat.\nTalking points\n\u2022 Anything you can do, I can do better? It feels a little bit like that at the top of Serie A at the moment, with Juventus thrashing Chievo 4-0, only for Napoli to respond by walloping Empoli 5-1 later on the same afternoon. The Bianconeri have now equalled their club record streak of 12 consecutive top-flight victories but the Partenopei have won six in a row themselves (the first time they have done so since 1988) and remain two points clear atop the table. And it\u2019s less than two weeks now until they meet in Turin \u2026\n\u2022 That\u2019s the sixth time that Napoli have scored five goals in a game this season, by the way. And yes, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn got one of them.\n\u2022 Juventus lost Mario Mandzukic to a calf injury that is expected to keep him out for the next four weeks. That scenario would spell trouble for many teams, but the champions are hardly short of options with Alvaro Morata rediscovering his form at just the right moment. The Spaniard had gone nearly four months without a goal, but grabbed two in the Coppa Italia win over Inter and followed up with another brace against Chievo on Sunday.\n\u2022 Paul Pogba\u2019s still doing ridiculous things, too, in case you were wondering.\n\u2022 Not that I imagine his presence would have changed the outcome on Sunday, but I do wonder whether Chievo will come to regret letting Alberto Paloschi depart in the middle of the season. The Flying Donkeys look comfortable enough right now in 11th place but no other player has scored more than four goals for them this season, and 27 points are not enough to feel safe with this many games left to play.\n\u2022 Roma recorded their first win of this Luciano Spalletti era, with the help of a pair of new signings. Ervin Zukanovic supplied the cross, but it was Stephan El Shaarawy who produced the magic \u2013 beating the keeper with a backheel volley on the turn for the Giallorossi\u2019s second goal. It would be nice to believe that this moment could mark the rebirth of a lost talent, but after previous false dawns I shall continue to hold judgment. If nothing else, the potential is still there for a player who only turned 23 in October.\n\u2022 The situation only gets bleaker for Sampdoria, whose loss to Bologna was their seventh in 10 Serie A games under Vincenzo Montella. With \u00c9der gone, and the advantage over 18th-placed Carpi (themselves unbeaten in five) down to four points, the risk of relegation looks very real indeed.\n\u2022 And finally an update on last week, when I noted that Kevin Lasagna was taking his Carpi team-mates out for dinner to celebrate his first Serie A goal. I wondered at the time what a man named Lasagna might choose for his evening meal. And, yup, you guessed it.\nResults: Atalanta 1-1 Sassuolo, Bologna 3-2 Sampdoria, Carpi 1-1 Palermo, Chievo 0-4 Juventus, Genoa 0-0 Fiorentina, Milan 3-0 Inter, Napoli 5-1 Empoli, Roma 3-1 Frosinone, Torino 0-0 Verona, Udinese 0-0 Lazio", "date_time": "2016-02-01T14:05:59", "author": "Paolo Bandini", "lang": "en", "topic": "Serie A|Sportblog|AC Milan|Internazionale|European club football|features", "category": "football", "title": "Milan channel Mark Hateley to win derby as Inter and Roberto Mancini lose control", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Milan fans unfurled a banner depicting the English forward\u2019s derby-winning header in 1984 before kick-off, and centre-back Alex recreated it as Milan enjoyed a rare derby success over Inter"},

Because being viewed as a corpse stalking the streets in a polyester Manchester City coat for the next five months is going to help Pellegrini do his job so much better now isn\u2019t it?\nAt least Pep might be easier for The Fiver to relate to, what with his super smart appearance, fastidious attention to detail, huge ambition and searing success. Ah. So what can English football expect from a man so driven by detail that Manchester City employed Txiki Begiristain three years ago just to ensure the Etihad cushions were correctly plumped in time for his arrival? Well, he\u2019ll probably be short on laughs (cough) and he\u2019ll create formations that nobody understands, not even floating football brain in a jar, Jonathan Wilson, and certainly not the players. \u201cGuardiola thinks about football and understands the machinations of the game at a level so deep that no one can follow,\u201d revealed a Bayern Munich suit in a Big Paper interview a few months ago that got football hipsters twiddling their Brian Kilcline-styled facial hair with glee. It\u2019s an approach that will surely go down well in the Premier League, where managers\u2019 tactical plans go out of the window at the first sign of a gust of wind.\nBut one thing we can be sure of this afternoon is that no amount of cake will sweeten Yaya Tour\u00e9\u2019s mood, what with him having been escorted towards the Nou Camp\u2019s door marked Do One by Pep in 2010. Here\u2019s what Tour\u00e9\u2019s Mr 15%, Dimitri Seluk, had to say about Guardiola a couple of weeks ago: \u201cThe truth is that my grandfather would win the title with Barcelona and Bayern Munich because they are big clubs with great players. I\u2019d like to see Pep take a club that is eighth or ninth and make them champions.\u201d The Fiver\u2019s going to take a wild guess and predict that Yaya will be a no-no when Pep steps in.\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\nJoin Nick Miller and Alan Smith through the evening as they liveblog the living daylights out of the transfer window slamming shut.\nRECOMMENDED LOOKING\nDavid Squires\u2019s investigation into what POJT does next is so good it gets a one week-only slot above Quote of the Day.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cHe\u2019s an interesting player, but not the player I asked for\u201d \u2013 Marseille coach M\u00edchel gives Florian Thauvin the big welcome back after he rejoined the club on loan from Newcastle.\nFIVER LETTERS\n\u201cI see The Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers fans have finally got what they\u2019ve always wanted.

It is the latest blow for the Czech Republic captain, who has suffered numerous injuries since joining the club in 2006, most recently a knee issue.\nThe 35-year-old, who has made 170 appearances in the Premier League over 10 years, is not expected to be offered a new contract at Arsenal when his current deal expires in the summer, meaning his final months at the club could be spent on the sidelines. Wenger did not know how long the midfielder would be out for but it is thought Rosicky \u2013 who had not played since June \u2013 will miss at least one month.\nAsked how he sustained the injury, Wenger said: \u201cNobody understands.

He comes on; after three minutes he got the injury.\n\u201cI looked at him and thought: \u2018Tomas you do not run properly\u2019 because he didn\u2019t lift his legs and he lost some balls. I was amazed because he is at the top level technically. He told me after the game that he did it [the injury] straight away.\n\u201cHe warmed up well, for 20 minutes. He\u2019s devastated.

Lewis Grabban, who returned to Bournemouth after an 18-month hiatus at Norwich, is popular with team-mates but will need time to convince he is worth an inflated \u00a37m fee second time around. Eddie Howe certainly now has enough firepower at his disposal for the final straight, though. Ben Fisher\nChelsea\nIns Alexandre Pato (Corinthians, loan), Matt Miazga (New York Red Bulls, undisc.)\nOuts Wallace (Gr\u00eamio, loan), Papy Djilobodji (Werder Bremen, loan), Alex Kiwomya (Fleetwood, loan), Christian Atsu (M\u00e1laga, loan), Ramires (Jiangsu Suning, \u00a324.3m), Patrick Bamford (Norwich City, loan), Charly Musonda (Real Betis, loan), Mitchell Beeney (Newport, loan), Marco van Ginkel (PSV Eindhoven, loan)\nThe window ended up feeling like a clearing of the decks. Ramires\u2019 departure for a hefty fee will help financially in the summer if players on Champions League contracts have not secured Champions League football. But the arrivals of Pato and Miazga hardly had the pulses racing, and some of the club\u2019s younger players might surely have merited an opportunity instead.

Instead, they secured Emmanuel Adebayor, who has played 17 minutes of Premier League football in a year, in the hope he retains an appetite to flourish in the English game. A risk? Perhaps not on a short-term, incentivised deal.

The Senegal international provides another option to a team and manager in urgent need of a revival, while another promising forward, Shani Tarashaj, was secured ahead of a summer arrival.

Still, attack has been a priority \u2013 their pursuit of a new striker has been determined but difficult. The new recruits, Demarai Gray and Daniel Amartey, add depth and ability for the run-in and beyond.

Interest in Schalke defender Joel Matip was also put on hold until the end of the season when the Cameroon international will be a free agent. There was success on Marko Grujic, however, with Liverpool beating Chelsea and Internazionale to a deal for Red Star Belgrade\u2019s highly-rated teenage playmaker. AH\nManchester City\nIns Anthony Caceres (Central Coast Mariners, undisc.)\nOuts Anthony Caceres (Melbourne City, loan), Patrick Roberts (Celtic, loan), George Evans (Reading, undisc.), Shay Facey (Rotherham United, loan), Ian Lawlor (Bury, loan), Bruno Zuculini (AEK Athens, loan)\nMade the signing of the window on deadline day (albeit not a player) when they announced Pep Guardiola would take over as their new manager. In regard to more traditional business they have made no new signings when at least one central defender would have been welcome, given Vincent Kompany\u2019s ongoing injury problems and the unreliable form of Eliaquim Mangala, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and Martin Demichelis. Jamie Jackson\nManchester United\nIns Adnan Januzaj (Borussia Dortmund, recalled from loan)\nOuts Victor Vald\u00e9s (Standard Li\u00e8ge, loan), Ben Pearson (Preston North End, undisc.), Liam Grimshaw (Preston North End, undisc.), Dean Henderson (Stockport County, loan), Kieran O\u2019Hara (Morecambe, loan)\nConsidering Louis van Gaal\u2019s travails this season Manchester United\u2019s stumbling campaign could have been kick-started by one or two headline signings \u2013 but there were none. So the manager\u2019s challenge now is to try and shepherd the players he has to secure a top-three finish and/or claim the FA Cup. If he does this it would constitute progress but whether it would save his job is a whole other debate. JJ\nNewcastle United\nIns Seydou Doumbia (Roma, loan), Henri Saivet (Bordeaux, \u00a35m), Jonjo Shelvey (Swansea City, \u00a312m), Andros Townsend (Tottenham Hotspur, \u00a312m)\nOuts Kyle Cameron (York City, loan), Mike Williamson (Wolves, undisc.), Lubo Satka (York City, loan), Florian Thauvin (Marseille, loan), Gael Bigirimana (Coventry City, loan), Shane Ferguson (Millwall, undisc.)\nHigh in the European spending charts but very low in the Premier League. And despite splashing all that cash the squad is still not properly balanced. At least the midfield \u2013 a big source of lots of problems \u2013 has been refreshed with Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s arrival a coup but major chinks in the defensive armour remain, while the attacking solution looks a bit of a temporary fix. Will Newcastle come to regret not signing Charlie Austin when they could have done? Or not buying Davide Santon back from Internazionale?

Having conceded 43 goals, Norwich also made defensive additions, signing Ivo Pinto from Dinamo Zagreb and Timm Klose from Wolfsburg. The 19-year-old midfielder James Maddison, a last-gasp signing from Coventry who will spend the rest of the season back on loan with the League One club, was highly coveted by big clubs and his addition could be a coup. Jacob Steinberg\nSouthampton\nIns Charlie Austin (Queens Park Rangers, \u00a34m)\nOuts Steven Caulker (QPR, loan ended), Sam McQueen (Southend, loan), Ryan Seager (Crewe Alexandra, loan), Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez (Middesbrough, loan)\nA positive window. The priority was to ensure that the predators did not lure away any of the club\u2019s stars, chiefly Sadio Man\u00e9 and Victor Wanyama and, also, to sign a centre-forward, so it was mission accomplished. There was not too much noise in the end around Man\u00e9 or Wanyama while Charlie Austin was a snip at \u00a34m. DH\nStoke City\nIns Giannelli Imbula (Porto, \u00a318.3m)\nOuts Steve Sidwell (Brighton & Hove Albion, loan), Eddy Lecygne (Doncaster Rovers, loan), Marco van Ginkel (Chelsea, loan ended)\nMark Hughes, after realising that Stoke would not be able to sign Saido Berahino from West Bromwich Albion, put all his transfer eggs into one basket with the arrival of Giannelli Imbula from Porto.

Wahbi Khazri, Sunderland\u2019s \u00a39m Tunisia international, playmaking, buy from Bordeaux, is supposed to have much in common with Mesut \u00d6zil. Can his undoubted talent keep Sunderland up? Or will his infamous bad temper undermine things? Is Lamine Kon\u00e9, the new French \u00a35m centre-half, any good? Only time will tell.

They have, nevertheless, thrown money around, breaking their transfer record twice \u2013 phrases involving leopards and spots spring to mind \u2013 despite several failed pursuits. Still, the arrivals are obvious upgrades and Nordin Amrabat, who simultaneously offers pace, natural width and cover at centre-forward \u2013 all of which had previously been lacking \u2013 could be a key signing.

The rest of the Republican field is in Iowa, in search of last-minute votes. On Sunday, Kasich held his 85th and 86th town hall events in the eastern state.\n\u201cI\u2019m a lot more interested in talking about what I\u2019m for than the people who are in the primary up here in New Hampshire,\u201d Kasich said to dozens of voters who came out on a sunny winter\u2019s day in Salem.\n\u201cI want to raise the bar. I want us to regain hope in this country. We can make this country work again.\u201d\nThe audience broke into applause.\nWhile his opponents tap into voter frustration, preaching doom and gloom, Kasich is wooing moderate Republicans and independents at schools, churches, gymnasiums and community centers across the state with a decidedly sunny vision for the country. It seems to be working.\nA series of recent state polls have shown Kasich\u2019s steady rise \u2013 and complicated path forward. Most place him in a virtual tie for second place with three candidates: Bush, Rubio and Ted Cruz. A realclearpolitics.com average of state polls confirms his second-place standing in New Hampshire, behind the longtime Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump.\nIn Bow on Sunday night, with a national debt clock ticking behind him, Kasich cast himself as a conservative, pointing to his record on fiscal issues in Congress and as governor of Ohio. He also pitched himself as a man willing to work across the aisle.\nYou laugh, but you know that\u2019s how it works John Kasich, on reaching across the aisle\nHe told the crowd he had a plan for ending gridlock in Congress. Part of his initial 100-day plan in the White House would include obtaining the phone numbers of the parents of each member of Congress, so he could call them on their birthdays.\n\u201cThat way I can get them to say to their son or daughter, \u2018Hey, the president called me today, you better not cross him because I like him. He wished me a happy birthday,\u2019\u201d Kasich said.\n\u201cYou laugh, but you know that\u2019s how it works.\u201d\nWith New Hampshire voters, Kasich deploys a mix of predictable humor (\u201cI\u2019ve not had that many town halls yet. This is only my 85th.\u201d) and the folksy touch (\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, kiddo.\u201d) that seems to be paying off.\nHe has picked up endorsements from seven of the eight local newspaper editorial boards and on Saturday he won endorsements from the Boston Globe and the New York Times. The latter paper\u2019s editorial board called Kasich the \u201conly plausible choice for Republicans\u201d.\nKasich said on Sunday he was \u201cthrilled\u201d to have won such high-profile endorsements.\n\u201cIt really illustrates for a lot of people that Kasich\u2019s a conservative but he has wide appeal,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cHe can get people to come who traditionally don\u2019t go. And the last guy I can think of who could do that is Ronald Reagan.\u201d\nIn two campaign stops on Sunday, Kasich was asked about climate change, religious freedom, immigration, creationism and American exceptionalism. In each case, he replied carefully \u2013 no doubt wary of attacks from his opponents that his views are too liberal and or inconsistent. His answers were nonetheless decidedly, even confidently moderate.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the cupcake business and somebody comes in and wants cupcakes, sell them cupcakes,\u201d Kasich told a voter who was concerned about the erosion of religious liberties. \u201cThat\u2019s my feeling about that. I won\u2019t have an argument about who you\u2019re selling the cupcake to, I just don\u2019t agree with that.\u201d\nWhen a first-time voter asked him why Republicans shy away from the topic of climate change, Kasich told him: \u201cDo I believe that human beings affect the climate? I do. But we don\u2019t quite know how much. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t things we need to do.\u201d\nHowever, on abortion and defunding Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest women\u2019s health organization, Kasich is staunchly conservative. He has declared himself \u201cpro-life\u201d, except in cases of rape or incest or if a woman\u2019s life is in danger.\nNew Hampshire and beyond\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Kasich points to a digital national debt clock during a campaign stop in Merrimack, New Hampshire, on Saturday.

A strong finish in New Hampshire, emerging as the clear establishment favorite, would position Kasich to compete for the blue and purple midwestern states, including his homestate of Ohio, Rath said.\nBut if Kasich does place favorably in New Hampshire, he will still face a long road ahead to the nomination. He\u2019ll have to clear the so-called \u201cestablishment\u201d lane of the Republican contest, which he currently shares uncomfortably with Rubio, Christie and Bush. It\u2019s also a lane voters seem to be turning away from in droves, borne out by the support for the anti-establishment, outsider candidacy of Trump.\nKasich, Rath said, stands a good chance of becoming the nominee if voters choose the path of least resistance rather than the road less traveled.\n\u201cThere are some people who are ideologically center-right. I call them \u2018governing conservatives\u2019,\u201d Rath said, refusing to use the \u201cestablishment\u201d label. \u201cThat\u2019s the lane I think people fit him in and that\u2019s the lane I think he\u2019s clearly gaining traction in.\n\u201cIf we color too far outside the lines and don\u2019t get somebody in that lane, especially if Secretary Clinton\u2019s on the other side, we run a big risk.\u201d\nHe\u2019s the opposite of Trump. I believe people are going to get tired of the show. Eventually they will want the genuine.\u201d Stacey Gobron, independent voter\nStacey Gobron, one of the state\u2019s coveted undecided independent voters, said her husband, Bob, had brought her to the Kasich event in Salem. She had been disappointed by the Republican party\u2019s frontrunners and was hoping to hear something different.\n\u201cI want low taxes like a Republican but I\u2019m also not so [socially] conservative,\u201d Gobron said.\nAfter hearing Kasich speak, Gobron said she believed she had found a candidate to support and was optimistic others like her would come around as well.\n\u201cHe\u2019s so genuine and I feel there\u2019s an honesty about him,\u201d Gobron said. \u201cHe\u2019s the opposite of Trump. I really believe people are going to get tired of the show.

Vampire Weekend played a benefit in Iowa on Saturday (the band were joined by Sanders and his wife Jane for a rendition of Woody Guthrie\u2019s This Land is Your Land), and others will appear at a Feel the Bern fundraiser in Los Angeles on Friday. Headliners will be the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who \u2013 presumably after a long band meeting \u2013 collectively declared in favour of the Vermont senator last September. \u201cBernie Sanders is the only remotely reasonable candidate for president of the United States,\u201d Flea had already tweeted in August. (The Chili Peppers, of course, being longstanding experts on what\u2019s reasonable.)\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bernie Sanders with Vampire Weekend lead singer Ezra Koenig wave during a campaign rally. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP\nIndeed, looking down the list of official Sanders backers, despite the presence of progressive rappers such as Killer Mike and Lil B, there seems to be a prevailing 80s and 90s flavour, suggesting he appeals more to the middle-aged indie crowd than to millennials. There\u2019s Lou Barlow of Dinosaur Jr, Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys, Belinda Carlisle of the Go-Go\u2019s, Jon Fishman of Phish, Billy Gould of Faith No More, Chris Shiflett of the Foo Fighters, Maureen Herman of Babes in Toyland and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth. Going further back, the faint sound of barrel-scraping gets louder as David Crosby, Mike Watt of the Stooges and Donovan (Mellow Yellow guy, British not American) are also included.\nStrangely, there\u2019s no sign on the list of Roger Waters (also British), who endorsed Sanders last October, or Simon and Garfunkel, who gave permission for their song America to be used on a campaign ad. This did \u201cnot imply an endorsement from Simon and Garfunkel\u201d, a spokesperson said at the time, but Art Garfunkel later told CNN that he and Simon were both asked about the song. \u201cIt\u2019s the moment when you say, Am I a Bernie guy? Yes, I am.\u201d Billy Bragg supports Sanders, too, but doesn\u2019t make the website either.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pharrell Williams is behind Clinton. Photograph: Steve Jennings/Getty Images\nIf the US were a rockocracy (one small mercy to be thanked, there), then the 2016 election would already be effectively over, with Hillary and Bill back in the White House. That\u2019s because Clinton has all the blue-chip endorsements going, including \u2013 deep breath \u2013 Kanye West, Beyonc\u00e9, Pharrell Williams, Katie Perry, Christina Aguilera, Burt Bacharach, Tony Bennett, Jon Bon Jovi, Mariah Carey, Cher, Kelly Clarkson, Ellie Goulding, Ice-T, Ja Rule, Elton John, Quincy Jones, Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, Janelle Monae, Morrissey, Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Sting, Barbra Streisand, James Taylor, Usher, will.i.am and Stevie Wonder. Which ought to do it.\nThe trouble with having such famous fans, however, is that they do tend to be asked their opinions about things, and their opinions are often fairly odd. For instance, 50 Cent spoke surprisingly warmly of Hillary to the Daily Beast, before explaining that he mainly admired her for tolerating Bill\u2019s infidelity. \u201cThe lust factor out of convenience,\u201d he said. \u201cThings happen at points, and her seeing past that made her human to me.\u201d Uh-huh.\nOr here\u2019s Pharrell explaining to GQ why he supports Hillary, and why she\u2019s sure to win: \u201cEverywhere you go in this country, you have red and blue. You got the Democrats; you got the Republicans \u2026 You know what else is red and blue? Blood. Blood is blue in your body until air hits it, and then it turns red. That means there\u2019s unity.\u201d There\u2019s quite a bit more along these lines, but to sum up Pharrell\u2019s position: the two main parties are represented by two colours that are the same as the two colours of blood (which is actually never blue), which means that, even though half of America hates Hillary, it is destined for a woman president. Infectious pop hits: definitely. Thinking about things: maybe not.\nHowever, perhaps most worrying for some would be Hillary\u2019s relationship with Kanye \u2013 which apparently includes taking his political ambitions so seriously that she would consider him as a possible running mate in 2016. \u201cI\u2019ve told Kanye that I think he might want to wait. Cause I\u2019ll be running for re-election,\u201d she has said. \u201cI might want to give him some additional experience so he\u2019s got, on all the other things he\u2019s done on his resum\u00e9, he\u2019s got some kind of envoy role or something he could point to ... I would not rule out anybody for vice president.\u201d Rockocracy might be closer than we thought.\nArtists for Trump isn\u2019t a very large constituency, for some reason. (Although he does have the hulk vote sewn up, with endorsements from both Hulk Hogan, who has volunteered as running mate, and Lou \u201cThe Incredible Hulk\u201d Ferrigno \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s a fabulous guy. I hope he goes all the way.\u201d)\nAmong the few musicians who have declared for Trump are the country music legend Loretta Lynn (\u201cI just think he\u2019s the only one who\u2019s going to turn this country around\u201d), hard-rock gun enthusiast Ted Nugent (\u201cDonald Trump is the hellraiser America has needed for a very long time\u201d) and Mr Las Vegas Wayne Newton (\u201cNumber one, he tells the truth. Number two, he\u2019s been where most of these guys want to be, in terms of riding on his own plane\u201d). In truth, Newton seems to be such an all-round positive guy that he\u2019ll endorse just about anything red. Jeb Bush would also \u201cmake an incredible president\u201d, he says. Plus he \u201cloves\u201d both Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Azealia Banks: \u2018I think Donald trump is evil like America is evil and in order for America to keep up with itself it needs him.\u2019 Photograph: Joseph Okpako/Redferns via Getty Images\nConfusingly, Trump also has the \u201csupport\u201d of Azealia Banks, whose reasoning, as she explained in a series of tweets today, goes as follows. \u201cJust because Hilary [sic] Clinton and Bernie sanders say nice things about minorities doesn\u2019t mean they actually mean them \u2026 I only trust this country to be what it is: full of shit. takes shit to know shit so we may as well put a piece of shit in the White House \u2026 In conclusion, I think Donald trump is evil like America is evil and in order for America to keep up with itself it needs him.\u201d Which is nice, but hard to leverage.\nAlways the mould-breaker, Trump is actually more of a specialist in counter-endorsements. Only this week, Adele has insisted that she did not give permission for him to play Rolling in the Deep or Skyfall at his rallies. Trump also got a letter from Steve Tyler\u2019s lawyers after he used Aerosmith\u2019s Dream On which, the letter complained, \u201cgives a false impression that [Tyler] is connected with or endorses Mr Trump\u2019s presidential bid\u201d. Michael Stipe of REM was even more forthright, if less lawyerly, last autumn, when he refused Trump permission to use his music with the words, \u201cGo fuck yourselves, the lot of you \u2013 you sad, attention-grabbing, power-hungry little men. Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Johnny Van Zant of Lynyrd Skynyrd is one of Marco Rubio\u2019s small musical following. Photograph: Mike Coppola/Getty Images\nNow we\u2019re running low on fuel. Rand Paul has the support of Jonathan Davis and Phil Labonte of Korn and All That Remains respectively. Ben Carson has Kid Rock. Jeb Bush has country singer Toby Keith. But it appears that no notable musicians at all would like to see a President Christie, Cruz, Fiorina, Kasich or Perry. Unlike Trump, few of the other Republicans have even been thought worth banning from anybody\u2019s music. \u201cI\u2019m like the only rightie in the leftie industry,\u201d Kid Rock plaintively told Fox News.\nWhich leaves Marco Rubio, who has perhaps the best chance of beating Trump to the nomination \u2013 and will hope to be powered there by the backing of Johnny Van Zant, the lead singer of Lynyrd Skynyrd (current lineup), as well as Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds, the successful R&B singer and producer whose nickname rather unfortunately describes Rubio himself. It remains to be seen whether this will be enough to distract attention from the support he is also getting from the pornographic actor Jenna Jameson, whose eye for a winner picked out Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201cI\u2019m very looking forward to a Republican being back in office,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cWhen you\u2019re rich, you want a Republican in office.\u201d", "date_time": "2016-02-01T19:08:29", "author": "Leo Benedictus", "lang": "en", "topic": "US elections 2016|Vampire Weekend|Donald Trump|Bernie Sanders|Marco Rubio|features", "category": "world|US", "title": "Backing bands: which musicians endorse which US presidential candidates?", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Vampire Weekend played a benefit for Bernie Sanders at the weekend, but which other rock stars have declared their intentions?

His closest rival, the Texas senator Ted Cruz, has repeatedly vowed to pursue the \u201cfundamentally different military strategy\u201d of carpet-bombing Isis without \u201capology\u201d, most recently in last Thursday\u2019s debate.\n\u201cWe will carpet-bomb [Isis] into oblivion,\u201d Cruz said in Iowa last month.\nMacFarland said the proposal contravened military professionalism and likened it to \u201cwhat the Russians have been accused of doing in parts of north-west Syria\u201d.\nRussia\u2019s authoritarian president, Vladimir Putin, and Trump have traded praise. MacFarland characterized Putin\u2019s airstrikes on behalf of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad as a divergent objective from the US goal of defeating Isis.\nThough MacFarland said his goal was to get home to his grandchildren, it is likely he will remain in command through the presidential election, and will in any case largely shape the war the next president will inherit.\nUnlike previous military officials and even the man who appointed him last fall, defense secretary Ashton Carter, MacFarland pointedly declined to provide reporters with specifics about the changing nature of the war in Iraq and Syria, particularly over key details such as prospective US troop increases or the recently expanded role of special operations forces.\n\u201cI\u2019d like the enemy to find out for the first time when the area around them is going up in smoke,\u201d MacFarland said.\nYet MacFarland telegraphed that he was looking at proposing \u201cadditional troops\u201d for the fight, particularly as he examines military capabilities that the current effort lacks. He characterized the war as closer to the beginning than the end, stating that the \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d will come when Isis loses its Syrian capital, Raqqa.\nMacFarland said the December recapture of Ramadi from Isis represented a \u201cturning point\u201d in proving the prowess of the long-sponsored Iraqi military. A forthcoming push to retake Mosul, Isis\u2019s power base in Iraq and the country\u2019s second-largest city, could also include US attack helicopters, he said, in an intensification of US air support for what is expected to be a large operation this year.\nYet MacFarlane indicated that ridding Iraq of Isis completely is an unlikely goal. Defeating Isis \u201cas currently configured\u201d in Iraq \u2013 a conventional force that holds territory and fights along front lines \u2013 would not rule out its persistence as a \u201clow-grade insurgency [or] terrorist organization\u201d, even if Iraqi forces backed by the US and Iran reclaim the areas Isis currently occupies.\nAs an army colonel in 2006 in Ramadi, MacFarland made his reputation by embracing a nascent split between Sunni tribal chiefs and the faction of al-Qaida that would, years later, transform into Isis. A decision by MacFarland, later adopted by higher US command, to align with Iraqi fighters he and other commanders had previously understood to be enemies became the genesis of the \u201cAwakening\u201d, a realignment of allegiances that aided the Iraq war\u2019s greatest period of tactical success.\nBut what the military has regarded as a turning point in the Iraq war has proven difficult to emulate. A program inspired by the Awakening, the Afghan Local Police, has yielded instead turf battles within US-sponsored Afghan ministries and allegations of human-rights violations. Around the time MacFarland took control of the war \u2013 an October 2015 move to consolidate a sprawling effort under a single officer \u2013 the Pentagon abandoned an expensive initiative to build a Sunni Syrian fighting force and opted instead to sponsor existing Kurdish and Sunni militant forces.\nWhile MacFarland and other US military officials have characterized the airstrikes against Isis as among the most precise in the history of warfare, the US has recently begun conceding that it has mistakenly killed and wounded civilians.\nThe private organization Airwars, which attempts to track the civilian impact of the bombing, has tallied allegations of between 2,029 and 2,635 noncombatants mistakenly killed in nearly 18 months of bombings, two orders of magnitude beyond what US military officials have confirmed.\nMacFarlane rejected criticism that recent attacks on Mosul facilities where Isis keeps its cash risked targeting civilians.\n\u201cIs an enemy banker a combatant or not? Just because he doesn\u2019t have an AK[-47] leaned up against a teller window, he\u2019s still a bad guy, right?\u201d MacFarland said, stating that the US airstrikes occur during times the US assesses will minimize loss of life.\nHawkish legislators and presidential candidates have proposed loosening the rules under which US pilots can open fire on targets, claiming that the US hamstrings itself in target selection out of fear of inflicting additional death on civilians in areas where Isis operates.\nMacFarland neither stated that he felt unreasonably constricted nor indicated sympathy to the critique, instead portraying distinctions between military from civilian targets as a battlefield advantage.\n\u201cRight now we have the moral high ground, and I think that\u2019s where we need to stay,\u201d he said.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T19:32:03", "author": "Spencer Ackerman", "lang": "en", "topic": "US military|Islamic State|Iraq|Syria|Republicans|Donald Trump|news", "category": "world|US", "title": "US military commander in Iraq and Syria rejects GOP pledges to 'carpet-bomb' Isis", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland said \u2018indiscriminate\u2019 bombing suggested by Donald Trump and Ted Cruz goes against army values: \u2018It matters how you win\u2019"},

The rapidly gentrifying neighborhood has experienced a real estate squeeze that tends to benefit the wealthiest property buyers.\nIf the center cannot buy the building, it plans to use the funds it has raised for its homeless LGBT youth programs at other sites.\nThese plans are a far cry from the desires of Atlah\u2019s Rev David Manning, who became pastor of the church in 1981.\nIn November 2015, he stood outside his building yelling hate speech at demonstrators affiliated with the Ali Forney Center.\nManning said that the church does not owe money and that his lawyer is involved in ongoing discussions with the court. \u201cI think it\u2019s just an uninformed move by people trying to do a land grab,\u201d Manning said.\nHe said he did not care that more than $100,000 had been raised for LGBT groups hoping to purchase the building.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what they do,\u201d Manning said. \u201cPeople do a lot of things.\u201d\nThe other Harlem LGBT group hoping to make a bid at the 24 February auction is the Rivers of Living Water church. The church\u2019s pastor, Vanessa Brown, said that she hopes the building can provide a permanent home for her church, which was founded in Harlem nine years ago.\n\u201cWe believe divine justice can transform a place of hatred in our community to a place of love and life. That is the reason we are seeking the funds to purchase the building,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe are asking for political, financial and social support.\u201d\nMore than 200 people are a part of the congregation, which attracts primarily LGBT people and their families and currently holds services in the basement of a Methodist church. It has raised nearly $18,000 on its Gofundme page as of Monday afternoon.\nBrown said that by having a permanent space, the church could continue and extend programming to include literacy efforts, after-school arts classes, GED lessons and transitional housing.\nBrown said that even if they cannot purchases the building, Atlah leaving the neighborhood would be significant for her and her congregation.

Trump went on to regain his lead ahead of Monday night\u2019s Iowa caucuses. Over the weekend, the Cruz campaign came under fire separately for mailing accusations of a \u201cvoting violation\u201d to individual Iowa residents amid what privacy and transparency experts said had amounted to \u201ca military escalation\u201d of data-driven campaigning.\nThe federally mandated release of expenditure filings on Sunday shows a crescendo of spending as well-funded campaigns and their allied Super Pacs bolster their digital firepower by pouring record amounts of cash into the so-called \u201cmicro-targeting\u201d of voters across social media with increasingly personal ads.\nCruz has deepened his ties to the little-known data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, directing around 20% of overall spending during the reporting period to the data scientists embedded at Cruz\u2019s campaign headquarters in Houston.\nTed Cruz campaign using firm that harvested data on millions of unwitting Facebook users Read more\nIn December, the Guardian uncovered long-standing privacy and ethical issues around the way Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent company had acquired detailed psychological data on tens of millions of voters using data harvested from largely unwitting Facebook users.\nCambridge Analytica is understood to be financed by hedge-fund magnate Robert Mercer, who is also the leading individual donor to the Cruz campaign. Last year, the influential but reclusive Wall Street executive channeled $11m into the pro-Cruz Super Pac Keep the Promise I.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert Mercer has taken an \u2018unusually active role for a major donor\u2019, says a campaign transparency watchdog. Photograph: ddp USA/Rex Shutterstock\nThe Mercer-backed group is part of a cluster of pro-Cruz Super Pacs, which all use a variation of the name Keep the Promise. In recent weeks Cambridge Analytica appears to have played a key role in a digital advertising blitzkrieg, funded by the web of Super Pacs that support Cruz.\nAccording to so-called \u201cindependent expenditure\u201d reports, the Mercer-backed group, Keep the Promise I, has paid out almost $350,000 to Cambridge Analytica since mid-November. The records state the firm provided unspecified \u201cmedia\u201d in order to support Cruz and attack rival candidates Marco Rubio and Donald Trump.\nWhile the Keep the Promise Super Pacs officially exist as separate entities, the groups work together and keep in touch with weekly strategy calls, according to the Washington Post. In the two weeks leading up to the Iowa caucus, the Super Pacs spent $1.1m on online campaigning and advertising.\nThe involvement with Cambridge Analytica by both the Cruz campaign and an allied Super Pac appears to contrast with a decision made by Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign last year to halt plans which would have seen the candidate share a data analytics company with the pro-Bush group, Right to Rise.\nIn October, the Associated Press reported the Bush campaign halted the plan over concerns around potentially crossing the line of coordination. Even after the 2010 US supreme court decision that allowed unlimited outside funding, candidates\u2019 campaigns and Super Pacs are prohibited from coordinating political activities and must maintain separate operations.\nRichard Skinner, a policy analyst at transparency watchdog the Sunlight Foundation, said shared vendors are traditionally one of the \u201cred flags\u201d when detecting coordination between a campaign and an outside group.\nAsked to examine the relationships stemming from Cruz\u2019s data-centric operations, Skinner said the campaign and Super Pac are not simply sharing a company that manufacturers campaign T-shirts, but a company that is providing an essential service to both.\n\u201cThe data is clearly pretty central to the campaign and presumably central to what the Super Pac is doing,\u201d Skinner said in a phone interview on Monday, adding that Mercer had taken an \u201cunusually active role for a major donor\u201d in Cruz campaign operations.\nIn an email, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO Alexander Nix said his company treats compliance with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) rules as an \u201cutmost priority\u201d. He added: \u201cWith this in mind we have strict fire-walling procedures in place wherein the staff, data, and systems for each campaign are physically and electronically separated.\u201d\nA spokesman for Mercer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBig data, bigger spending on Trump hats\nThe latest federal disclosures suggest the Cruz campaign is relying heavily on Cambridge Analytica as a pillar of his campaign operation, spending $3,055,990.95 from October through December. \u201cWe have a very successful relationship,\u201d Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told the Guardian in December, adding that information was acquired legally. \u201cThey\u2019re a great company, they provide us great data, and it helps us be highly effective in communicating with our voters.\u201d (Tyler and a campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this article.)\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cruz campaign expenditures on the data firm Cambridge Analytica. Photograph: Screenshot: ProPublica Campaign Finance API\nSo far, other Republican candidates have spent considerably less on comparable data firms and digital-focused political consultants.\nOf the $1.3m Rubio\u2019s campaign spent during the final quarter of 2015 on digital campaigning \u2013 or what on the campaign trail is known as \u201cdigital, data and analytics\u201d \u2013 the largest sum of around $460,000 went to Optimus Consulting, a relatively small data analytics firm which has an established relationship with the Florida senator\u2019s campaign.\nMeanwhile, Trump spent more on hats than he did on data analytics. In early November, his campaign paid $235,000 to L2 Political, a minor Washington-based voter targeting and analytics outfit which focuses on political clients.\nOverall, Bush\u2019s campaign spent around $800,000 on the digital campaign trail, over half of which went to Deep Root Analytics, a firm co-founded by former Mitt Romney data scientist Alex Lundry, who also serves as the Bush campaign\u2019s director of analytics.\n\u2018Violations\u2019 \u2013 and a war for targeting\nIn the final hours ahead of the 2016 campaign\u2019s first vote, which was set to begin in Iowa on Monday evening, the Cruz campaign was condemned from all sides for applying its newfound targeting prowess to old-fashioned voter outreach.\nOn Friday, it emerged the campaign had sent official-looking direct mail to some voters accusing them of a \u201cvoting violation\u201d. The mailer, which did not involve Cambridge Analytica, used so-called \u201csocial pressure\u201d techniques and calculated a fake score for each target voter, along with their neighbors, according to their participation in recent elections.\nResponding to the controversy on Saturday night, Cruz was bullish. \u201cI apologize to nobody for using every tool we can to encourage Iowa voters to come out and vote,\u201d he told a press conference in Sioux City.\nExperts in modern-day election outreach said the mail episode, taken together with big-money online profiling, showed the Cruz campaign\u2019s expertise in using psychological methods to pressure individuals into voting.\nDavid Peterson, a professor of political science at Iowa State University, appreciated that Cruz is trying to run a \u201csmart and advanced\u201d campaign by drawing on psychological techniques and academic research, but claimed the mailer had crossed a line.\n\u201cWe know candidates and campaigns mislead people all the time about themselves and their opponents,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the misleading about private citizens who have no connection to any of this that strikes me as particularly galling, and that\u2019s what\u2019s a step too far.\u201d\nHow Facebook tracks and profits from voters in a $10bn US election Read more\nIn recent years, a wide body of academic research has found \u201csocial pressure\u201d is often highly effective in increasing turnout \u2013 the key blockage in the senator\u2019s path to overtaking Trump\u2019s poll lead at the caucuses.\n\u201cJust by gently signalling that people are watching you has been shown to increase participation,\u201d said Eitan Hersh, a political scientist at Yale University who focuses on voter attitudes and campaign strategy.\nJoseph Turow, a leading data privacy expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said that as the 2016 primary votes arrived, political analysts had seen an \u201cupward trajectory\u201d in data-driven campaigns targeting voters across devices and in specific moments.\n\u201cEssentially it\u2019s a military escalation because every group and every competitor is trying to outdo the other,\u201d he said in an interview ahead of Sunday\u2019s federally mandated filings.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T21:39:52", "author": "Harry Davies", "lang": "en", "topic": "US elections 2016|Ted Cruz|US political financing|US politics|Republicans|news", "category": "world|US", "title": "Ted Cruz erased Trump's Iowa lead by spending millions on voter targeting", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Filings reveal Texas senator paid $3m to profiling company as hedge-fund billionaire seeded advantage in \u2018military escalation\u2019 of data-powered campaign"},

A booklet they\u2019ve published online tries to steer citizens away from recurrent pitfalls, especially as elections near\nAs a student and political activist in Iran, Abbas Hakimzadeh was jailed three times between 2007 and 2010. He survived physical and psychological abuse, enduring torture for up to 15 hours a day.\nSuspecting a fourth arrest was imminent, in 2010 Hakimzadeh fled across the border to Turkey. The Iranian authorities had confiscated his travel documents, and Hakimzadeh took the risk of being shot by border guards to avoid yet another stint in prison.\nStill, the ordeal he faced over five years ago pales in comparison to what currently awaits activists and journalists who fall into the clutches of Iran\u2019s justice system, he says. Since the unrests of 2009, the Islamic republic expanded its use of legal tools, including capital punishment, to silence dissidents.\n\u201cThe stakes are much higher now,\u201d says Hakimzadeh. \u201cIn my time, the price you paid for activism was prison. But since the Green Movement, this price has gone up.\u201d\nIran's Jila Baniyaghoob on journalism, prison and Rouhani Read more\nOne example is the charge of moharebeh, or \u2018waging war against God\u2019, which carries the death penalty. Iranian authorities have expanded the scope of its definition from \u2018armed war against the state\u2019 and \u2018heresy\u2019 to include \u2018working to undermine the Islamic establishment\u2019 and \u2018cooperating with foreign agents or entities\u2019. This allows Iranian officials to adjust the meaning of moharebeh to apply to anything from an angry post on Facebook or Twitter to participating in a spontaneous protest rally.\nHakimzadeh believes there are steps activists in Iran can take to better protect themselves, both inside and outside prison walls. He belongs to a group of over a dozen activists who used their hard-earned personal experiences to create a 19-chapter booklet in Farsi and English titled Safe Activism: Reducing the Risks and Impact of Arrest.\nDesigned to teach activists and journalists how to avoid careless behaviors that could endanger them and those around them, the booklet, now online, also offers guidelines on what to do in case of arrest and how to mitigate the consequences of incarceration.\nMahdieh Javid, who left Iran in her early teens, played a crucial role in writing the booklet. Through her work with activists who left Iran between 2009 and 2010, Mahdieh came into contact with activists based in Iran and made an alarming discovery.\n\u201cWe realized that many instances of arrest could have been avoided by taking a few simple measures,\u201d she says of her motivation for spearheading the project. \u201cThese issues are not talked about or sufficiently discussed. Many of the mistakes are repeated.\u201d\nThese basic safety measures are highlighted in the first chapters of the \u2018Safe Activism\u2019 booklet. Readers are reminded to take precautions before meeting with other activists and not communicate important information over the phone. They are advised to keep sensitive documents as well as identification papers and travel documents at a safe place outside their residence, and to clear their homes of illegal items like drugs, alcohol and banned media.\nMehdi Aminizadeh, another activist who contributed to the project, says his family sent him books from his home library during one of his four stints in prison, without realizing one of them was contraband. Possession of that banned book was later added to his charges.\nThe guide also devotes a section to digital security. Readers are advised to memorize phone numbers, addresses and other sensitive information instead of recording them. The booklet recommends using a different email address for activism-related exchanges, and preventing the recovery of deleted files by using software like File Shredder.\nLooking back, Hakimzadeh says one of his biggest mistakes was writing an email to his girlfriend with instructions on what to do if he was detained. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I had kept the file on my computer or deleted it and they managed to recover it, but my interrogators knew about it and used it against me.\u201d\nKeeping insanity at bay\nActivists have no real way of telling when and if they will be arrested or how serious their punishment will be. The arrest strategies employed by Iranian officials also differ. Some arrests are quick and predictable while others come as a surprise as authorities take time to \u2018gather information and get to know the person better.\u2019\n\u201cFor others, they prepare a scenario and wait for certain things to transpire before playing out that scenario...They let the fruit ripen first and then pluck it,\u201d says Hakimzadeh.\nThe booklet gives readers insight into what to expect during arrest and prison admission, as well as tactics commonly used by interrogators: threatening physical harm and arresting the subject\u2019s family members, employing physical and psychological torture, sexual assault, as well as performing random acts of kindness.\nReaders are also advised to not incriminate others when \u2018confessing\u2019. In written confessions, the authors recommend giving vague answers and including the interrogator\u2019s questions in their statements. They advise detainees to write what is in their best interest as opposed to what they told the interrogator. To prevent prosecutors from using the confession as evidence against them in a later case, the detainees should number and date all pages. They should also prevent additions by crossing out all blank spaces. Detainees may also write illegibly and scratch out words to make their confessions inadmissible in court.\nPreparing activists for solitary confinement, a common method used to break detainees, is perhaps one of the most significant undertakings of the guide. Hakimzadeh, who spent a total of 190 days in solitary, describes it as a vacuum that felt like death.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t experienced death but I think this is how it must feel. It is very sudden and unexpected. In an instant, you are cut off from everyone and everything,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t do trivial things that were once normal and you took for granted like opening a door, looking at yourself in the mirror, or checking the time on your cellphone.\u201d\nAs time went by, exercise, meditation, positive thoughts and cleaning his cell, among other things, helped Hakimzadeh keep insanity at bay.\n\u201cI had a Quran and a prayer book in my cell and I would study them and take notes with the pen and paper I had found and managed to hide,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving writing material was illegal there. I would think about my notes and have discussions about them with myself. I would talk to myself. I would walk in my cell for hours.\u201d\nThe Safe Activism booklet is not the first of its kind, but its writers believe that it is more current on the methods used by Iranian authorities. Compiled by a large group of activists whose ordeals of persecution and incarceration are recent, the booklet incorporates the voices of student activists, women\u2019s rights activists and the Green Movement as well as other groups.\n\u201cSome of the items were new even to me, for instance I knew what happens to political and student activists in section 209 [of Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison], but I didn\u2019t know about what happens to prisoners in other cities like Sanandaj or Ahvaz or to religious minorities. This booklet includes their experiences too,\u201d says Hakimzadeh.\nWhile the intended audience of the booklet are activists in Iran, its online nature also gives Islamic republic authorities access to its volume of information. However, the writers of Safe Activism are not concerned that revealing the methods used to persecute activists will result in a change of tactics.\nReading the booklet could lead Iranian officials to take a \u201csmarter approach\u201d, but Hakimzadeh says it will not change the fact that once a \u201cperson knows the basics of what will happen there, it will help them adapt.\u201d\n\u201cAt the very least,\u201d adds one of the contributors who asked to remain unnamed, \u201cit lets them know they are not alone. Others have gone through this ordeal in the past, and some of those people are safe now.\u201d\nThe Tehran Bureau is an independent media organisation, hosted by the Guardian.

Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\nMadeleine Moon, the Labour MP who is a member of the defence select committee, said safe havens were a wonderful idea in principle, but in practice there was no point establishing them unless they were actually going to be safe.\nShe said such safety was unobtainable because President Bashar al-Assad and the Russians controlled the air and the ground, and had surface-to-air missiles that could take down any coalition forces seeking to enforce a safe zone. \u201cWe cannot create something because we want it to exist when we don\u2019t have the capability to enforce it,\u201d Moon said.\nShe said Russia, and not the coalition, was responsible for the majority of civilian deaths inside Syria, and that the coalition was not involved in carpet bombing.\nShort claimed this was backwards, rigid thinking, and pointed out the UK had voted for UN security council resolutions backing the lifting of sieges and unfettered humanitarian access. She said that would require the UK to adopt a more flexible approach to the conflict. \u201cThe military have got to reconsider their tactics and not just bomb and bomb,\u201d she said.\nJo Cox, the Labour MP with whom Mitchell has worked on Syria, wrote to Cameron on Sunday night saying she was saddened that he \u201chas lost focus on the political dimensions of the crisis and that the EU referendum has diverted both officials and ministers who could otherwise have been focused on addressing one of the worst humanitarian crises of our time\u201d.\nShe urged him not to subcontract UK diplomacy to America. She said: \u201cThe US view of the crisis is not one and the same as either the UK\u2019s or the EU\u2019s.

The concept of an election is familiar to everyone \u2013 but by its very name, a caucus sounds different and archaic. However, give or take a few wrinkles, the Iowa caucuses are simply another election, held on a cold winter\u2019s night in the Hawkeye State. But those wrinkles do matter quite a bit.\nRepublican frontrunner Donald Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, try to get out the last-minute vote ahead of tonight\u2019s caucuses. Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters\nIs it the same process for Democrats and Republicans?\nNo. Whereas Republicans have a relatively straightforward process, in which they cast secret ballots in their precinct caucuses, it\u2019s far more complex for Democrats.\nRepublicans\nRepublicans have a secret ballot. Voters take a piece of paper and mark the name of the candidate whom they support. These votes get counted in each precinct and reported to the state party.\nThese totals are supposed to be reflected in the final Republican delegation to the national convention. Rules implemented after Ron Paul finished third on caucus night in 2012 but eventually controlled Iowa\u2019s delegation are supposed to enforce this.\nThe totals reported on caucus night are simply normal vote tallies as in any other election.\nThat is not the case with Democrats.\nDemocrats\nDemocratic caucuses are quite undemocratic. Each precinct is apportioned a number of delegates based on Democratic turnout in the past two elections. It\u2019s like an electoral college at a micro level.\nThis means turnout doesn\u2019t matter. If a precinct is supposed to have five delegates to the county convention, it doesn\u2019t matter if eight people show up to the Democratic caucus or 800. The precinct is still only getting five delegates. (Precincts elect people to the county convention, which elects people to the district convention, which elects people to the state convention.)\nAfter attendees show up to a Democratic caucus, they are divided into preference groups based on candidates whom they support. Bernie Sanders supporters will stand in one area, Hillary Clinton supporters in another. Once everyone is separated, there is a first count of how many supporters each candidate has.\nTo be viable in each precinct, a candidate usually needs to receive the support of 15% of those who attend, although in some small rural precincts, the threshold is higher.\nIf a candidate\u2019s support is under that threshold, his or her supporters need to induce others to join their group in order to reach 15%. If they are unsuccessful in doing so, their candidate is not considered viable and they can either go home or support a candidate who is viable instead. There is then a second count of supporters for each candidate and, from those totals, delegates are assigned.\nThis means that if Democratic candidates are polling under 15% statewide on caucus night, they could significantly underperform compared to their polling.\nKey demographic groups\nDespite this socially conservative slant, the key group in Iowa on the Republican side in 2016 will be more moderate \u201ccountry club\u201d Republicans. With Donald Trump and Ted Cruz appealing to those conservative voters looking for red meat, if moderate Republicans in the eastern part of the state coalesce behind one establishment candidate \u2013 Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush or Chris Christie \u2013 it could make this a three-person primary, with evangelical, conservative and establishment camps each emerging with a viable contender.\nOn the Democratic side, students will be the key demographic to watch. This will be the first Iowa caucus in over a decade that has taken place when colleges and universities are in session. If Bernie Sanders can successfully organize and turn out young people across the state, it could give him an edge in several key counties across the state.\nTurnout will also be important on the Republican side, as many of the voters most attracted to Trump\u2019s candidacy are new to the political process. The higher the turnout, the better for Trump. In contrast, overall turnout is a mixed indicator for the Democratic primary. While Sanders is also hoping to turn out a number of voters new to the political process, an increase in turnout doesn\u2019t necessarily bode well for him. After all, while Clinton may have lost the state in 2008, she still vastly surpassed her vote goals and likely turned out more people than every other Democratic candidate in the history of the caucuses besides Obama.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T23:20:12", "author": "Scott Bixby|Alan Yuhas|Ben Jacobs|Harry Davies|Sabrina Siddiqui|Lucia Graves|Amber Jamieson|Spencer Ackerman|Leo Benedictus|Lauren Gambino", "lang": "en", "topic": "US elections 2016|The 2016 campaign, minute-by-minute|US politics|Iowa|Republicans|Democrats|Donald Trump", "category": "world|US", "title": "Iowa caucus day: Palin praises Trump as 'he who will be the next president' - as it happened", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Follow live updates from across Iowa as state casts first votes of 2016 campaign, with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clinging to leads"},

Like an increasing number of young women lured from garment factories on the promise of better work and brighter horizons in China, she ended up sold to a stranger and trapped in a life of abuse as one of Cambodia\u2019s trafficked brides.\nAfter months of sexual assault and domestic servitude, Phany escaped. What she never expected was that when she returned to Cambodia she would be treated as an outcast, her life still plagued by the horrors she had lived through.\nEvery year, dozens of Cambodian women are trafficked to China and sold as brides. Although there is no official data available, one Cambodian human rights group, Adhoc, says it received 35 new cases last year. Foreign ministry spokesman Chum Sounry says that in 2015 the Cambodian government facilitated the return of 85 trafficked brides who had managed to reach a Cambodian consulate. Many others who are unaccounted for are thought to be trapped and unable to return home.\nA journey across four continents: Danziger's tales from Cambodia | Rory MacLean Read more\n\u201cYou can be sure that for every woman who escapes her captivity in China and returns to Cambodia, there are dozens more that never make it out,\u201d says Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division.\nChina\u2019s former one-child policy and the preference for male children created such skewed sex ratios that some families are unable to find local women for their sons to marry. Poor villages in Cambodia have been increasingly seen by traffickers as a source of potential brides.\nThey offer young women and their families \u2013 whose employment options often range little further than working in garment factories \u2013 decent work, better pay and more opportunities in China.\nPhany, now 29, worked for six months as a poorly paid seamstress in a local factory. She decided to travel to China with her 20-year-old sister after her cousin introduced her to a Chinese couple who said they could offer her more lucrative factory work.\nWhen they arrived in Shanghai they were met by a Cambodian man who said he was arranging work for them. The next day, the sisters were sold to two men who came to buy wives. One of the men paid cash for Phany and took her away, telling her that he was her new husband. They later registered their marriage, though Phany has never seen the documents.\nPhany\u2019s life became a cycle of physical, sexual and mental abuse as she carried out chores under the watchful eye of her husband and his mother.\nUnable to communicate through speech, her husband would rely on gestures to give orders, often becoming aggressive if they weren\u2019t obeyed.\n\u201cSometimes even if there wasn\u2019t any problem he\u2019d attack me,\u201d she says, as she mimicked her husband pulling at her hair and kicking her. She says she was frequently raped.\nIn her six months in China, Phany tried to escape three times. The third time her husband caught her, he hit her repeatedly in the stomach before finally letting her go.\nBorrowing money from her parents, she returned to Cambodia. \u201cI felt so happy. It was like being born again,\u201d she says.\nYet when she returned to her community, she was treated as an outcast and blamed for the abuse that she\u2019d suffered. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to talk to me any more,\u201d she says, describing how her family had been torn apart by her experience.\nPhany eventually left her village and went to work in Phnom Penh, where she says she can live a more anonymous life.\n\u201cI used to not want to get to know anybody because I didn\u2019t want to admit what happened to me,\u201d she says. \u201cWhenever I go back to my village I feel so ashamed.

None of them made suggestions that were illegal.\nOne lawyer, Mark Koplik, was recorded by an undercover investigator from anti-corruption charity Global Witness as saying: \u201cSo we have to scrub it at the beginning, if we can, or scrub it at the intermediary location.\u201d\nKoplik, who boasted that US authorities \u201cdon\u2019t send lawyers to jail because we run the country\u201d, advised the minister could hide his identity and avoid US anti-money laundering checks by exploiting a loophole and wiring the money directly to a US law firm to avoid probing questions about the legitimacy of the funds. Global Witness said its investigator told lawyers that the minister\u2019s money \u201crepresented payments to him for helping companies receive mining concessions in his country\u201d.\nUS to crack down on high-end real estate purchased with 'dirty money' Read more\nKoplik, a managing partner of Henderson & Koplik on Manhattan\u2019s Lexington Avenue, also advised the use of family trusts to obscure the paper trail. \u201cThe smaller ones are often more flexible and understanding and less concerned about their reputation, because they fly to a greater extent below the radar screen,\u201d he said.\nKoplik refused to comment to the Guardian. David Gendelman, a lawyer representing Koplik, refused to provide any comment because Global Witness had not provided a copy of the undercover footage. Gendelman refused to state whether Koplik denied the allegations. Neither Koplik nor any of the other lawyers secretly recorded entered into any agreement with Global Witness\u2019s undercover activist, and none took him on as a client. Nor were any of the suggestions made by the lawyers illegal.\nAnother lawyer recorded was James Silkenat, a partner at Sullivan and Worcester who was president of the American Bar Association at the time of the filming last year. Silkenat explained how a complex web of ownership companies could be created \u201cto insulate his ownership from public view\u201d.\n\u201cCompany A is owned by Company B, who is owned jointly by Company C and D, and your party owns all of or the majority of the shares of C and D,\u201d Silkenat explained.\nThe undercover activist told Silkenat that the minister earned about as much as a US teacher but wanted to buy a $10m brownstone, a $20m Gulfstream private jet and a yacht that \u201cwould be at least, if you\u2019re talking about an [Roman] Abramovich [style] yacht, this dimension would be around $200-$300m\u201d.\nSilkenat\u2019s colleague, Hugh Finnegan, said the supposed minister would not be alone in trying to hide his identity as the real owner of the assets. \u201cMany foreign owners just don\u2019t want anybody to know who they are. So they set up either corporations or in some cases they set up limited liability companies, and it\u2019s usually one or two other companies up the food chain, making it more difficult to identify [who the real owner is].\u201d\nSilkenat said companies were routinely created to hide the true owners from public scrutiny. \u201cLots of the big apartment buildings here, where the purchase price ranges from $30-$90m, now are done through a corporate entity to shield whoever\u2019s buying it from public discussion.\u201d This is not illegal.\nSilkenat and Finnegan deny that they acted inappropriately and said they found the undercover activist to be \u201cdishonest and untrustworthy\u201d and would \u201cunder no circumstances \u2026 ever take on such a client\u201d.\n\u201cA full recounting of our experience with [the investigator] shows we did the right things,\u201d Silkenat and Finnegan said in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cWe participated in a preliminary meeting with someone who we reasonably believed to be a reputable attorney. We listened, we told him that there would be a need to conduct due diligence on the background and past activities of his purported client, as well as the sources of the funds his \u2018client\u2019 was seeking to invest.\n\u201cWe told him that his minister\u2019s activities must be shown to have been lawful \u2013 under both the laws of the United States and other countries \u2013 and that we would not assist with any unlawful activity, going so far as to state that we believed that we would be obligated to report any unlawful activity on the part of his client to the authorities. The legal and financial topics we discussed were basic and generic and obtainable through a Google search and are used on an everyday basis in the US to protect privacy concerns.\u201d\nThey said that if the camera had followed them after the meeting it would have shown them concluding that the investigator was \u201cdisreputable and that we would not deal with him again\u201d.\nThe Global Witness investigation comes as the US government prepares to begin a crackdown on corrupt foreign officials and international criminal leaders buying up multimillion-dollar Manhattan apartments with \u201cdirty money\u201d.\nJennifer Shasky Calvery, director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a branch of the Treasury, said \u201call-cash\u201d buyers of high-end properties will, from March, be forced to reveal the true \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d and would no longer be able to hide behind a string of shell companies. \u201cWe are seeking to understand the risk that corrupt foreign officials, or transnational criminals, may be using premium US real estate to secretly invest millions in dirty money,\u201d she said.\nThe World Bank estimates that about $1tn is paid in bribes every year, with corruption disproportionately affecting the world\u2019s poorest people, particularly in Africa.\nThe circumstances suggested by Global Witness in its undercover filming closely mirror those of Teodoro Obiang, son of the president of Equatorial Guinea, who allegedly used US lawyers to move more than $100m into the US.

Do not allow them to marry a man like him.\u2019 My son will be my legacy.\u201d\nThis is not only a promise she\u2019s made to herself and her children, it is a commitment she has made to the entire community of Mading Kantok, the remote home of semi-nomadic cattle traders belonging to the Dinka tribe in Warrap state, South Sudan.\nAccording to Joyce Patra, from the Organisation For Children\u2019s Harmony, a local NGO, the only way a girl can avoid being married off early \u201cis if her mother doesn\u2019t disclose to the father that she has started menstruating. Girls have economic benefit attached to them because one girl can be married in exchange for 150 cows\u201d.\nDomestic violence is rife in South Sudan.

At the end of the project, each person makes a promise.\nAnjelina, 32, a mother of five, was married at 15 to a man twice her age who already had two wives. \u201cI had no idea about sex. My wedding night felt like digging at the dry soil. I learned that if husbands want you to bring food or water you do it without complaining, even if you are heavy with pregnancy.\u201d\nAnjelina\u2019s promise is to help rape survivors in her community. \u201cRape is so common and is the big issue for me. We should not allow rape victims to suffer shame. I am really working on this.\u201d\nMayan Awak, the community engagement officer who led the discussions, says men beat their wives as a show of masculinity. \u201cSince I was six years old I was taught this is how it is, so I couldn\u2019t just say, \u2018This is wrong. Stop it\u2019. Instead we asked people to talk openly \u2013 whether they are a chief or a housewife. I asked them to say honestly, \u2018What are the things that pain you?\u2019\n\u201cWhen we talked like this people saw that many of the problems they had were because of gender violence. For example, in our community, raids to steal cattle from another village are common and raping women is always a part of the raiding. But then people take revenge and use rape as a weapon, so there is more rape and more conflict. And on it goes.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anjelina, seen here in her home in Gogrial, Warrap state, has promised to help rape survivors in her community.

The latter process will soon be underway locally, if permission is granted from the ministry of social development.\nThe men\u2019s promises were along the lines of: \u201cI will help my wife, I will cook, I will not beat my wife, I will wash the utensils.\u201d\nFor Masumi Yamashina, child protection and gender-based violence specialist at Unicef, which is supporting the project (pdf), these are small but significant changes. \u201cIn Warrap it was considered a sin for men to do any household work. When I went there last, I saw men pumping water in water points. That was unthinkable before. I hope it\u2019s a model we can expand not only in South Sudan but in other countries where social norms are unfair to women and girls.\u201d\nThe project is being monitored through detailed interviews with participants. But it is hard to know just how meaningful the changes are. One man says his second wife is in her 30s because \u201cit is right to marry an older woman\u201d. His wife, however, says she is 16. But she does feel her husband is a changed man. \u201cHe is calmer. I really feel this. Before he beat us every day, but now it is less. I also watch him talking with other men in the community and I can see the way he behaves is different. He doesn\u2019t get angry so easily.\u201d\nFor Awak, who now cooks at home \u2013 to the initial horror of his family \u2013 this is the overall goal. \u201cGender violence isn\u2019t just about men and women, it is about an imbalance of power \u2013 and from that all violence comes.

A high-calibre bullet passed through the floor of the helicopter, hitting Gower first in the leg then in the shoulder before exiting through the roof.\nDespite his injuries, Gower managed to fly the helicopter down into a tree, allowing his spotter, Nicky Bester, time to jump out before it crashed to the ground.\nGower\u2019s brother, Max, 42, has set up an online fundraising page to raise \u00a350,000 to help anti-poaching efforts in Tanzania.

He would never have gone near a poacher with a gun. Normally in a helicopter you see poachers a long way out of their range. There\u2019s not that many places to hide.\n\u201cAs I understand it, he was taken by surprise. He didn\u2019t see the poachers until he was very close to them.

In less than 24 hours, he had raised nearly \u00a310,000 of the \u00a350,000 target. Most, if not all, the funds will go to the Friedkin Conservation Fund that conserves more than 2.4m hectares (6.1m acres) of Tanzania\u2019s protected wildlife areas.\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s a displacement therapy because the more time you spend talking to people and doing something, the less time you spend worrying and grieving for the fact you\u2019re never going to see your brother again.\n\u201cYou realise there are so many good people out there: the world is full of amazing people and it\u2019s just ruined occasionally by a very, very small minority who think and act differently to everybody else.\u201d\nGower and his partner in Brazil had been trying to find a way to live together in the same country, Max said. \u201cHe had a girlfriend in Brazil, who I know he loved very much and she loved him.

Despite all of the challenges, and in the middle of such a brutal crisis, it is remarkable that countries continued to distribute bed nets and vector control programmes were aggressively applied. It could have been horrible, but instead Liberia managed to sustain the gains it had already made.\u201d\nPhumaphi also praised countries including Zambia and Chad that had made impressive gains in reducing malaria because of domestic investment. \u201cThere are many countries that may not have reached the MDG target but have still performed incredibly well; it\u2019s just that they had different starting points,\u201d she said.\nThe sustainable development goals (SDGs), which replaced the MDGs this year, aim to achieve universal health coverage and end the malaria epidemic by 2030.

Downing Street said on Monday that no decisions had been taken regarding British troops and fended off questions about whether they would be deployed in a combat or training role.\nUS considering fresh military action in Libya over Isis threat Read more\nThe Ministry of Defence has not confirmed reports it is willing to send as many as 1,000 troops to the country, which has fallen into chaos following the violent overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi and allied air strikes in 2011.\nAgreement on a Libyan national unity government was reached in December but so far has been rejected by rival Libyan parliaments, including the one recognised by the international community, in a dispute about ministries.\nDavid Cameron will be reluctant to seek cross-party support in the Commons for further UK military action so soon after investing much political capital in winning support for airstrikes in Syria.\nThere is at present no support for airstrikes from the Africa Union, and it is likely that the Commons foreign affairs select committee will shortly produce a scathing report on the failure of western post-conflict planning after the 2011 toppling of Gaddafi.\nJeremy Corbyn, the opposition leader, is likely to oppose any intervention, and the shadow foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, would face a further dilemma over whether to support further military action against Isis.\nIf any action does go ahead it may be possible that British involvement would be so limited that it would not warrant Commons authorisation. Britain was previously active in the skies above Syria largely through surveillance and air-to-air refuelling without being involved in airstrikes. UK intelligence and special forces would not need Commons permission to operate in Libya. Britain has already sent a small number of troops to Sudan as part of an international peacekeeping force.\nThe talk of western military action in Libya restarted after the US defence secretary, Ash Carter, said last Thursday that allies were preparing options to prevent Isis from establishing training sites in Libya and welcoming foreign fighters in the way it had done in Iraq and Syria.\nLast Friday Gen Joseph Dunford Jr, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said military officials were \u201clooking to take decisive military action\u201d against Isis.\nThe Pentagon has sent special forces to the area to look at military options to drive Isis from its base along a lengthy strip of coastline around the city of Sirte that lies between Benghazi and Tripoli.\nIt is claimed that as many as 3,000 Isis fighters are active in the country taking advantage of the political chaos to seize land and oilfields. The fighters may have gone to Libya because the now relatively secure Turkish-Syrian border has made it more difficult for potential recruits to join Isis in Syria.\nIsis has used heavy weapons to launch attacks against a series of oil facilities and there has been an increase in suicide missions. US officials say there has been an influx of Isis fighters into Libya, partly as a result of the stronger controls on the flow of fighters into Syria from Turkey.\nItaly\u2019s defence minister, Roberta Pinotti, told Italian media last week that her country was considering joining the USs, Britain and France in military intervention to stabilise Libya. Pinotti told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that western powers would intervene only if requested to do so by Libyan authorities.\nIn an interview on French television Sunday, the French defence minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said there was an urgent need for a political solution in Libya. \u201cI\u2019ve been very worried about Libya since September 2014,\u201d Le Drian said. \u201cThere they are just 200 miles from [the Italian island of] Lampedusa, and they are expanding.\u201d\nIs America about to sleepwalk into a war in Libya?

{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/feb/01/dadaab-somalia-home-cannot-leave-refugees", "content": "For more than a decade now, Dadaab has held the dubious honour of being the world\u2019s largest refugee camp.\nOriginally set up back in 1992 as a transit camp for those fleeing a war-torn Somalia, the refugee complex is home to over 350,000 mostly Somali refugees. It sits in one of the harshest terrains in Kenya and since it was meant to be a transition zone, houses are semi-permanent. The walls are built from twigs cut from surrounding shrubs. Some lucky residents have tin roofs, but for most pieces of canvas that were once pitched as tents form the much needed cover from the sun over their heads. Windows are not a priority, blocks of wood and straightened out USAid tin containers form doors. Houses are built close together leaving a narrow corridor between them. Most hardly rise above six feet.\nIn its 25 years of existence, the camp has been a home to hundreds of thousands of refugees in search of a safer, better life. Many have found this within the five camps that make up the massive complex. Life for them is safer. Exploding bombs and whizzing bullets become a distant memory. But for those within the camps, peace has come at a price: freedom.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kenyan police require outsiders to have an armed escort at all times when in the refugee camp. Photograph: Daniel Wesangula/the Guardian\nMovement in and out of the camp has always been a challenge. Now though, it has become even harder. Kenya, their host country for a quarter of a century, is grappling with security challenges which authorities are blaming on refugees. The government has insinuated that the camp is a recruitment hotbed for terror group Al-Shabaab. This has made moving from one place to another difficult for the camp\u2019s residents. Warsame Abdihakim came to Daadab in 1993 at the height of the chaos in Somalia and, like many of his friends and relatives, hasn\u2019t ventured out of the complex since then. \u201cWe have tried, but our reasons are never good enough,\u201d he says.\nIn order to be granted permission to leave the camp, residents need a special pass that can only be issued after a vetting process that includes oral interviews. \u201cOne time the motor to my ice maker broke down,\u201d says Abdihakim. \u201cI had to wait for a month for someone to bring me a replacement. How do I survive? By trusting those on the outside.\u201d He is one of the biggest businessmen in Hagadera, one of the five camps that make up Dadaab, and runs a restaurant and an ice making plant. \u201cEven with all this, they think if I leave the camp I will not come back,\u201d he says.\nAs we grew older, we understood the limits of our lives\nFamily life in Dadaab\nFor all his life, 25-year-old Mohammed Abdi Abdulahi has been part of this boxed-in population. So has his wife. Now they have a daughter and all they want is a chance for their little girl to see the world outside. \u201cWe can\u2019t let her grow up thinking this is all that life has to offer,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want her to have a country she can call home.\u201d Mohammed\u2019s daughter, Sumaiya, is one of 6,000 grandchildren of the first arrivals that came to Dadaab in the early 1990s.\nOn one of the walls of the family\u2019s hut an out-of-date calendar shows a green meadow, contrasting to the surroundings. Massive deforestation has left Dadaab devoid of almost all vegetation. An insatiable appetite for charcoal and wood for the construction of houses has stripped the ground bare. The golden brown soil stretches as far as the eye can see.\nAbdulahi\u2019s wife, Sara Hassan, says they once had dreams about their future, but now they have grown resigned to their fate. \u201cWe dreamt of getting a good education and good jobs. But as we grew older, we understood the limits of our lives,\u201d she says. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want Sumaiya to give up on her aspirations.\u201d Her daughter, playing around her parents\u2019 feet, has just turned three. In a year she will be enrolled in one of the schools within the camps run by NGOs.\nThe other refugee crisis \u2013 women on the run from Central America Read more\nThe only way for the family to leave the camp is to qualify for asylum in an ongoing UNHCR resettlement programme and end up in another country. They have seen friends and family get settled all across Europe and the United States. But Abdulahi says that was before things got complicated.\n\u201cI am a father, husband, a refugee and Muslim from a country many do not understand. Events around the world make it hard to get asylum,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I stay put and continue to re-apply for the asylum.\u201d\nAbdulahi says he has no preferred destination and jobs are hard to come by. With his secondary level education, he has worked for various NGOs. But a heightened threat level within the camps has forced many of such organisations to abandon operations in Dadaab, resulting in the shrinking of an already small job market. \u201cI just want my family and I to get out,\u201d he says.\nBusiness in Dadaab\nFor others like Abdihakim, the ice shop owner, Dadaab is home. \u201cIf I leave, where will I go? I have been here for 25 years. I have learned to live with the limited movement,\u201d he says.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Warsame Abdihakim serving customers at his ice shop. Photograph: Daniel Wesangula for the Guardian\nHe has no reason to leave. His restaurant, in the middle of a busy street near Hagadera\u2019s main food and clothes market, is the busiest in the camp. Every day from sunrise to sunset hundreds attracted by the smell of cooking goat meat make their way to Midnimo Restaurant.\nThe camp\u2019s outdoor market, popular for meat, sugar, spices, fruits and clothes is Abdihakim\u2019s immediate neighbour. At lunchtime, it feels as if the whole market converges in his restaurant for a meal. The air is filled with sounds of hungry patrons calling out orders to a waiter at the end of the room, laughter from acquaintances sharing a plate of pasta and the voices of customers haggling over the price of a fabric or a kilo of khat. Spoons are hard to come by. Patrons prefer to eat with their hands. \u201cFood is sweeter that way,\u201d says Abdihakim, in the centre of it all.\nWill a 'grand bargain' solve the humanitarian funding crisis? Read more\nIf the Kenyan government has its way however, Abdihakim will need to find a home elsewhere. In 2013 the government made links between the camp and the attack on Nairobi\u2019s Westgate mall. As a result, the Kenyan government signed an agreement with UNHCR to work on voluntary repatriation of Somali refugees in Dadaab. Now, many in the camp know it is only a matter of time before they are sent \u201chome\u201d to Somalia. The Garissa University Massacre, in which terrorists linked to Dadaab killed 147 people, further strengthened government\u2019s resolve to close the camp.\nAt the time of the massacre in April 2015, Kenya\u2019s deputy president gave a three-month ultimatum for the camp to be shut down or the refugees forcefully moved back to Somalia. He has since taken a softer approach after concerns were raised by the international community. For now the camp remains, but no one knows for how much longer the third biggest city in Kenya will exist.\nJoin our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

Both the AHA and Clubs NSW gave Labor funds for \u201csubscriptions\u201d: $27,500 from the hotels and $66,000 from the clubs.\nParties must specifically declare amounts of more than $12,800 received from an individual or organisation in a single financial year, which the AEC then publishes online.\nWhile the AEC calls any sum of money given to a political party a donation, parties are able to classify amounts as \u201cdonation\u201d or \u201cother receipt\u201d at their own discretion, where other receipt may refer to anything from financial returns from investments or payment for membership fees or event tickets in lieu of donations.\nThe Greens have long been calling for an overhaul of the nation\u2019s donations system and Labor supports changes such as a reduction in the disclosure threshold to $1,000.\nThe major parties came close to an agreement in the last parliament to increase taxpayer-provided funding by $1 a vote and to reduce thresholds for declaring donations to $5,000, but Abbott retreated after a party room backlash. Currently, public funding of $2.62 per vote is provided to parties and candidates garnering more than 4% of the primary vote.\nThere could be a fresh push for changes soon. The parliamentary joint standing committee on electoral matters is conducting an inquiry into the financing of political parties, including public funding and private donations. It is due to report back in March on how the Australia\u2019s laws compare with those of similar countries.\nThe leader of the Greens, Richard Di Natale, said the system was broken because vested interests were \u201cthrowing around big wads of cash\u201d but voters had to wait up to 18 months to see the details\u201d.\n\u201cHere we are in an election year and we could have an organisation, an international donor, seeking to influence the outcome of the election this year and we won\u2019t know about that until after the election result is concluded,\u201d Di Natale said. \u201cWe need major reform in this country around election donations.

Economists back the idea that bracket creep is a long-term problem but a looming funding crisis that could jeopardise services at already stretched public hospitals is probably more likely to grab the attention of the electorate. Especially when the same voters are funding their own tax cuts by paying more for goods and services.\nIf Morrison wants to convince a sceptical electorate that economic growth and bracket creep are the nation\u2019s biggest problems and a GST hike is the way to fix them, he\u2019s going to have to do better than saying that the government is for \u201cjobs and growth\u201d while Labor is about \u201ctax and spend\u201d.

While their symptoms were not life-threatening, both required medical treatment. Police searched a property in Rutherford later on Sunday where they seized an undisclosed quantity of Chronic.\nCaldicott said he was seeing more young people coming through his emergency department suffering the ill effects of synthetic drugs, also known as new psychoactive substances, which are manmade substances designed to mimic the effects of other illicit drugs such as cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy.\n\u201cThis is definitely something that has increased in the past 10 years, and there is now doubt the hostile prohibition approach to drugs based on ideology is directly responsible,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBy making a drug like cannabis the enemy, we have pushed the market to change to produce drugs that are completely novel, which can be ordered online and paid for by crypto-currencies and which can\u2019t be detected by sniffer dogs.\n\u201cThese drugs are marketed as natural alternatives but nothing could be further from the truth, these compounds were developed by chemists, and these drugs never existed 20 years ago before our prohibitive approach to drugs.\u201d\nThe substances in synthetic cannabis differ greatly, making it hard to treat those who have severe reactions to the substances. Hundreds of distinct potential synthetic cannabinoids had now been identified and more are released frequently. As a result, doctors have no idea what patients are reacting to, what to test for, or how to treat them.\nAn Australian-led systematic review of adverse events arising from the use of synthetic cannabinoids published this month in the medical journal, Clinical Toxicology, found use of the substances was low in the general community at less than 1% of the population, though use was higher among students and some niche groups subject to drug testing.\nMajor complications from the substance included cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke, seizures, psychiatric illness including psychosis, paranoia, and self-harm and severe, prolonged vomiting. Rapid heart rate was also common.\nThe president of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, Dr Alex Wodak, said by legalising organic cannabis, doctors and policy makers would at least then know what substance they were dealing with.

We are prepared to go back to the Australian people as we did in 2013.\u201d\nThe independent senator John Madigan also called on the Turnbull government to take a broader approach to corruption but would not comment on the federal corruption commission proposal until he had seen more details.\n\u201cWhen constituents approach me complaining of corruption, unfair practices and unconscionable conduct their complaints inevitably relate to their treatment at the hands of banks, financial planners, lawyers, accountants, valuers, doctors, builders, major supermarket chains or government departments,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNot once has a constituent approached me to complain that they were ripped off by their union, yet this seems to be the government\u2019s exclusive focus.\u201d\nMadigan said that illegal activities needed to be \u201cstamped out\u201d but criticised the Turnbull government\u2019s approach as having \u201cmore than a whiff of ideology about it\u201d.\nThe only surprise in Heydon\u2019s trade union report is its lack of rhetorical flourish | Richard Ackland Read more\nHe said if the government\u2019s ABCC bill was aimed at corruption across the board he would sign up tomorrow.\n\u201cIt is not just a happy coincidence for the Coalition that [Dyson] Heydon\u2019s report appeared at the beginning of an election year,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis gives it ammunition to, firstly, pressure the Senate to pass anti-union laws it previously rejected and, secondly, to fight an election campaign on this issue against an opponent it hopes will be sullied through its association with the union movement.\u201d\nThe independent senator Jacqui Lambie told the ABC she would not support the ABCC bill while the government was considering making cuts to Medicare.\nAnd the Liberal Democratic senator David Leyonhjelm wants to place an eight-year sunset clause on the legislation so it does not stay on the statute books indefinitely.\nWhen the Greens tried to introduce a bill to establish a federal commission against corruption in 2014, Coalition senators argued the current multi-agency approach was sufficient to fight corruption while Labor senators argued that it was \u201cpremature\u201d.\nAt the federal Labor conference last year, a former party vice-president, Tony Sheldon, who is the national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, included a motion for a federal Icac but it was taken down at the last minute.\nAt that time, the shadow special minister of state, Gary Gray, echoed the Coalition by saying the existing agencies were already working.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T06:11:06", "author": "Gabrielle Chan", "lang": "en", "topic": "Australian politics|Independent Commission Against Corruption|Australian trade unions|Michaelia Cash|Labor party|Liberal party|news", "category": "world|australia", "title": "Dio Wang aims to create 'national Icac' by amending building watchdog bill", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Senator says a federal corruption body would focus not just on unions but public officials, politicians and white-collar crime"},

The 1989 ban on the international trade in ivory and conservation efforts that helped populations of big African animals recover in the 1990s now looks like a golden age. In 2007, 13 rhinos were poached in South Africa. In 2014, 1,215 were poached. Last year, numbers fell for the first time since 2007 \u2013 to 1,175. More than 129,000 elephants have been killed for their ivory since 2012.\nIn this climate, it is hard to regard good news with anything other than pessimism. Africa\u2019s lion population is estimated to have halved since 1990 but scientists at Oxford University\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU) have discovered a previously overlooked population of up to 200 lions in national parks in Ethiopia and Sudan. These beasts won\u2019t survive unless those countries can be helped to protect them.\nWhat to do? Follow the money. For we know what lies behind the poaching epidemic: lucrative markets for rhino horn and ivory in China and Vietnam, and traditional Chinese medicine\u2019s fetishisation of exotic animal parts. South-east Asian governments are not doing enough to stop industrial poaching; western leaders are not doing enough to force them to stop. This year, China\u2019s government unveiled draft laws that confirm the legality of its exotic animal farms and allow local administrations to license trade in endangered species. This is a backwards step.\nThere is opportunity of sorts here. Endangered elephants, rhinos, lions and tigers are a gift to today\u2019s distrusted governing elites. Stopping their slaughter would be tremendously popular. It is also a much easier win than the daunting, much trickier challenge of combating climate change. Tough, targeted sanctions would force south-east Asian governments to properly police the trade in endangered animal parts. Davos or the G20 could do something useful and bring charismatic megafauna back from the brink. That would be a turn-up wouldn\u2019t it?\nPop-up parakeets\nDuring the RSPB\u2019s Big Garden Birdwatch last weekend, ring-necked parakeets were spotted in Glasgow. Thousands of these escaped pets now fly in London, and new Scottish populations shouldn\u2019t be a surprise given that this species is happy in the Himalayas. Our actions are forcing animals and plants to change habits \u2013 or habitat \u2013 with disorientating speed. Still, it can be joyous when they do.\nWhale of an apology\nI recently walked across the marshes at Friskney, Lincolnshire, to find the fifth dead sperm whale. Unlike the other four whales stranded on popular beaches, this one was virtually unvisited. At first, it reminded me of a small submarine, an inanimate object, its dark-grey skin flaking like peeling paint. But when I tentatively touched its back, it became a he, a fellow mammal. He smelt sickly sweet, his blunt head raw red from his struggle in the North Sea\u2019s treacherous shallows. So big, and so vulnerable. He was too large for us to help. Sometimes it feels like the problems we have created for all these big beasts become so large that we can no longer solve them. I said sorry.

Proposals for Havana\u2019s old harbour are described as \u2018Las Vegas meets Miami in the Caribbean\u2019. So can the city cope with the commercial storm ahead?\nIn central Havana\u2019s Parque Fe del Valle, at the end of a street bustling with the usual scenes of queues for the bakery and clapped-out 1950s cars weaving between piles of rubble, is a glimpse of a very different Cuba. Every bench, wall, dustbin and plant pot in this tree-lined square is occupied by bodies hunched over laptops and gathered around smartphones, as people swipe at tablets and gesticulate at their screens.\nThree generations of one family are huddled around a phone, the children fighting over who gets to wear the headphones while the granny holds a baby up to the camera \u2013 so that relatives in Miami, who they haven\u2019t seen for years, can inspect the family\u2019s new arrival. Nearby, two brothers scroll through Facebook to check the latest enquiries for their bed-and-breakfast business, their laptop balanced on a makeshift desk of crates, while a gaggle of teenage girls stream music and practise dance moves under a tree.\nThis lively scene, which looks like an impromptu secondhand technology fair, is the result of a new phenomenon in Cuba: Wi-Fi hotspots. In a country where the internet is still forbidden in private homes and an hour checking emails at an internet cafe can cost nearly a week\u2019s wages, the arrival of five designated Wi-Fi zones in Havana has been nothing short of revolutionary.\nWalk along La Rampa by night, the long people-watching road that slopes up from the seafront into the neighbourhood of Vedado, and you\u2019ll see huddles of ghostly faces, illuminated only by the glow of screens. These sprawling open-air internet lounges have also spawned a new informal economy. Wi-Fi touts wander the streets like drug-pushers, re-selling the state telecom company\u2019s prepaid $2 scratch-off cards for $3 apiece, muttering \u201ccards, cards?\u201d instead of the usual \u201chashish? girls?\u201d. Snack stalls and drinks stands \u2013 private enterprises that would have been forbidden five years ago \u2013 have sprung up to fuel the spontaneous street-corner parties, where people gather around to watch the latest Hollywood trailers on YouTube.\nThe Wi-Fi hotspots revolutionising Havana park life \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\u201cWe are seeing a whole new quality of public space,\u201d says Miguel Antonio Padr\u00f3n Lotti, a Cuban professor of urban planning, who worked at the country\u2019s National Physical Planning Institute for 45 years. \u201cCubans have always socialised on the streets, but now we can interact with the wider the world at the same time.\u201d\nThe wider world is arriving here in ever bigger droves, and not just through the internet. On the cobbled streets of Habana Vieja, the beautifully restored old town, it can now be hard to move for the throngs of package tour groups. They follow their flag-toting guides between cafe-lined squares, shuffling from the Museo del Chocolate, past living statues and outposts of Victorinox and Diesel, to boutique shops housed in majestic old mansions where handmade watches are on sale for $12,000.\nNot long ago, all this was crumbling. The improbable transformation is the work of the Office of the City Historian, a vast state department of architects and planners headed up by Eusebio Leal Spengler since 1981. Wielding unheard-of power for an architectural historian, equivalent to that of a mayor, he has won plaudits from Unesco and heritage bodies around the world for what he\u2019s achieved here over the last 30 years, against all the odds.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A street in Havana before the latest spate of restoration. Photograph: Claudia Daut/Reuters\nIn the early 1990s, Leal persuaded Fidel Castro to set up a state-owned tourism enterprise, Habaguanex: a company charged with developing hotels, restaurants and shops. Crucially, it would plough the profits back into restoring Havana\u2019s derelict buildings and streets, as well as seeding social projects and community facilities. It was a canny model of capitalist tactics deployed for socialist ends, which has seen Leal\u2019s office channel more than half a billion dollars into the old town. The company now presides over a growing empire of 20 hotels, 40 restaurants and 50 bars and caf\u00e9s, as well as dozens of high-end boutiques.\nBut outside the tourist circuit of the four main plazas and the carefully repaved pedestrian routes that wind between them, two-thirds of the old town remains in a perilous state. Castro\u2019s revolution was fundamentally anti-urban, focusing on restructuring the rural economy at the expense of the colonial capital, and the consequences are all too visible. Look beyond the newly polished stage-set facades, and you\u2019ll still find families living several generations to a room in buildings that threaten to collapse around them at any minute.\nAlthough half of the profits of Habaguanex are ploughed into social initiatives \u2013 including health clinics, schools, libraries and old people\u2019s centres \u2013 the renovations have come at a price, exaggerating the divisions between the scrubbed-up and the squalid. Many former residents of these grand historic buildings have been rehoused far away from the centre, in the hated suburbs of Alamar and Habana del Este across the bay to the east. More look set to be displaced as the pressure to accommodate foreign visitors only continues to rise.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Havana\u2019s harbour area is the focus for future redevelopment. Photograph: Oliver Wainwright\nOne local cafe owner, who used to live in an historic building in the old town with 20 other families, now has to travel two hours a day to get into work, since his former home was renovated. But he has mixed feelings about the consequences. \u201cThe tourists might be pushing us further away,\u201d he says, \u201cbut they\u2019re also bringing in money that the city desperately needs. And our building was about to fall down anyway.\u201d\nAs part of the growing restaurant industry, he benefits from being paid in the currency that foreigners have to use on the island \u2013 the convertible peso, or CUC \u2013 which, pegged to the US dollar, is 25 times more valuable than the local currency, the Cuban peso (CUP). It is a gulf that has effectively created two classes of citizen in this supposed land of equals: those with access to hard currency, and those without. \u201cLife is better if you work for the tourists\u201d is how one rickshaw driver puts it \u2013 as two middle-aged Americans struggle to get out of his fibreglass cabin, adding a generous tip on to the already over-priced fare.\nNothing is going to happen very quickly, for the simple reason that it takes so long to get anything done Belmont Freeman\nMore than 3 million tourists came to Cuba last year, boosted by a sharp increase in the number of US visitors, which has surged by almost 40% since Obama ushered in a thaw in diplomatic relations at the end of 2014. American citizens are officially still forbidden to travel here for the sole purpose of tourism, but the sanctioned categories of travelling to \u201csupport the Cuban people\u201d and for \u201cpeople-to-people activities\u201d are vague enough to allow tour operators to thrive. American cruise-ship giant Carnival is already planning to bring \u201cculturally themed\u201d cruises here from May, making it the first such cruise company to visit Cuba since the 1960 trade embargo. According to the IMF, an end to the embargo could see as many as 10 million US tourists a year \u2013 a deluge for which the creaking, crumbling bones of Havana are far from prepared.\n\u201cThe infrastructure just isn\u2019t there to cope with such numbers,\u201d says Belmont Freeman, a Cuban-American architect based in New York, who has made frequent trips to Havana over the last 15 years. \u201cThe city is woefully underserved for hotels and even if more were built, the services couldn\u2019t supply them. The mains water system hasn\u2019t been improved since the 1920s \u2013 it still loses around 50% through leakage.\u201d\nNot that this seems to be standing much in the way of the luxury hotel developers, who have their sights set on opportunities across the city. On the eastern side of Parque Central, just visible through a cloud of construction dust from nearby roadworks, stands the stately frontage of the Manzana de Gomez building, a classical pile that occupies an entire city-block, built as Cuba\u2019s first shopping mall in 1910. Now entirely stripped out, it stands as an eery windowless shell, awaiting the opulent filling of a five-star Kempinski hotel planned to open later this year.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A shipping warehouse turned into an art and souvenir market. Photograph: Oliver Wainwright\nAround the corner, the Hotel Packard is being similarly spruced up and expanded by Spanish starchitect Rafael Moneo for Iberostar. Further north, near the package beach resort of Varadero, British property developer London & Regional has unveiled plans for The Carbonera Club,a $500m luxury development of 1,000 Conran-designed residences arranged around an 18-hole golf course. Taking advantage of a recent relaxation of regulations, it will allow foreigners to own beachfront property on the island for the first time. US chains such as Marriott and Hilton can do nothing but stand drooling from just 100 miles across the Straits of Florida, waiting for the embargo drop.\nOne insider describes some foreign developers\u2019 proposals for the harbour as 'Las Vegas meets Miami in the Caribbean'\n\u201cI give it two years, max,\u201d says Freeman. \u201cIt will be US business interests that finally push congress into lifting the embargo \u2013 they\u2019re all going crazy being shut out of this market.\u201d American architects and developers are already queuing up to be first in line, ready to pounce on investment opportunities when the embargo drops. Frank Gehry sailed into Havana in December, aboard a streamlined yacht he designed for himself, here to \u201coffer his expertise to Cuba\u201d according to a government statement.\n\u201cYou know that Cuba is at the centre of attention of many people,\u201d Gehry told the gathered crowd. \u201cAnd in the immediate future it will attract many investors \u2013 particularly the tourism sector. But I am sure that you know to be careful with those projects.\u201d\nJorge P\u00e9rez, a Cuban-American condo tycoon based in Miami, paid a visit to Havana for its art biennale last year. \u201cI wish they would let me be the developer for all of this,\u201d he told Miami newspaper el Nuevo Herald on his return. \u201cI think I could change Havana in 10 or 20 years. If they opened things up and I could build a luxury condominium in Vedado, I would sell them in two hours here in Miami.\u201d\nIt is the kind of prospect that worries Miguel Padr\u00f3n, who is not sure that Havana is ready to cope with what developers are preparing to throw at it. \u201cWe will have many divas and divos arriving with their very nice drawings,\u201d he says. \u201cBut as a society, we desperately need to improve our capacity to debate and discuss these plans. The challenge is how to capture the potential of the market in the right way, to learn how to negotiate with foreign investors. Havana is now the big cake \u2013 and everyone is trying to get a slice.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest This elevated railway line could become Havana\u2019s High Line. Photograph: Oliver Wainwright\nAll eyes are focused on bay of Havana itself, once the source of the city\u2019s immense wealth and now the place from which investors are hoping to extract an even bigger bounty. With the opening of a new $900m port 30 miles west of Havana at Mariel \u2013 built with Brazilian help \u2013 the old harbour now represents the next major development opportunity: a derelict jumble of warehouses and struggling fragments of industry.\n\u201cThe harbour is the embryo of the city,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Antonio Choy Lopez, a Cuban architect who sits on the board of UNIAC, the Union of Cuban Writers and Artists: a body charged with assessing plans for the bay. As one of the best natural harbours in the Americas, enhanced by impressive fortifications in the 16th century, it was where the Spanish galleons assembled, laden with riches plundered from the New World, before sailing in protected convoys back to Europe. Huge quantities of gold and silver, along with Alpaca from the Andes, emeralds from Colombia and mahogany from Guatemala, were all traded here, bringing profits that are wrought in Havana\u2019s palatial buildings. \u201cIt was a cultural crossroads, the very reason for the cosmopolitan character of the city,\u201d says Choy. \u201cAnd its redevelopment is now the most important project facing Cuba this century.\u201d\nFor such an important project, precious little is actually known about the plans. Not that the sense of mystery is unusual. In Cuba, things are rarely announced until they actually happen. \u201cThey never publish targets here,\u201d says one foreign diplomat, \u201cbecause they usually don\u2019t meet them.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An informal street property market. Photograph: Oliver Wainwright\nChoy talks of proposals to turn the harbour into a centre of \u201cculture and recreation\u201d: the redundant Tallapiedra power station might become an art gallery, along the lines of London\u2019s Tate Modern, while the site of the Nico Lopez oil refinery across the bay, where a chimney still belches thick black smoke 24 hours a day, might be developed into a new city of science and technology. There is talk of transforming an elevated railway line into a linear park, like New York\u2019s High Line, as well as plans for a big new transport hub next to the old train station.\nSensitively done, it could have a similar quality to harbour revitalisation projects such as San Francisco\u2019s Fisherman\u2019s Wharf or Cape Town\u2019s V&A Waterfront; the elegant steel-framed warehouses repurposed with minimal intervention. One such shed has already been reborn as a crafts market, while another recently reopened as a restaurant and microbrewery.\nHowever, the future of such enterprises, post-embargo, could be precarious given the complex history of land ownership here. One US shipping company has an $850,000 claim on a kilometre stretch of the waterfront, including the brewery building, which they say was seized from them after the revolution. The same goes for many such buildings across the city and beyond, with the value of claims for confiscated US property totalling almost $8bn, including long-standing claims from the likes of Exxon, Texaco and Coca-Cola. Despite diplomatic talks, compensation issues have yet to be resolved.\nThere is also no guarantee that the next stages of the harbour redevelopment will be as low-key as the warehouse renovations completed so far. Havana may well find itself catapulted from having too little money to having too much, too fast, with all the usual consequences. One insider describes some foreign developers\u2019 proposals for the harbour as looking like \u201cLas Vegas meets Miami in the Caribbean\u201d.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yet another renovation in Havana\u2019s Old Town. Photograph: Reuters\nFreeman is more optimistic. Havana will be saved from the worst effects of commercial speculation, he thinks, by a combination of glacial Cuban bureaucracy and happy accident. \u201cNothing is going to happen very quickly, for the simple reason that it takes so long to get anything done,\u201d he says. \u201cOther countries have been trying to develop in Cuba for decades, and they\u2019ve been stymied all along by the country\u2019s sclerotic controls over every aspect of economic activity.\u201d The harbour will also be protected from the \u201cVenice syndrome\u201d of vast cruise-ships dwarfing the city with their stacked cliff-faces of cabins, he says, because the boats simply won\u2019t be able to get in. A road tunnel, laid across the bottom of the bay in a big concrete tube in the 1950s, makes it too shallow for them to enter.\nAt the other end of the scale from the grand waterfront plans, there are signs across the city of a new kind of real-estate development. Scaffolding has long shrouded much of Havana, but it no longer just signals the work of the City Historian. Recent changes to property laws, which have allowed Cubans to buy and sell their own homes for the first time in years, paired with a relaxation of US rules on how much money Cuban-Americans can send to their family back home, have spawned a micro-real estate industry of independent renovation. Families with access to cash from overseas are doing up crumbling buildings themselves and either letting them out as holiday rentals (possible through Airbnb since last year) or selling them on \u2013 minting a wealthy new class in the process.\nHavana: one of the world's great cities on the brink of a fraught transition Read more\nIt is a change in legislation that foreign companies have been quick to pounce on. Choy is currently putting the finishing touches to the renovation of a building on the waterfront, working closely with Cuba Real Tours \u2013 one of a growing number of companies developing boutique holiday lets across the city.\nThey have encountered the chief difficulty of anyone trying to do construction work in Cuba: the dearth of materials. Glass still isn\u2019t produced on the island, so each window has to be imported \u2013 and the customs limit of four windows per person, or two doors, mean these small-scale refurbishments often entail getting friends and family to help out.\nBut such obstacles certainly haven\u2019t limited the aspirations of would-be developers, or the level of quality that they can achieve with a bit of Cuban resourcefulness. Freeman describes an \u201ceye-popping\u201d day he spent with one of Havana\u2019s fledgling estate agents, touring spectacular 1950s houses that had been fixed up extraordinarily lavishly and are now being offered for up to $800,000.\nElsewhere there are penthouses listed for more than $2m, although no one knows how much anything is really worth: there are no benchmarks and no mortgage industry. Instead, people gather at the end of Paseo del Prado, standing with handwritten signs around their necks, displaying faded photos of apartments for sale, and browsing listings written in dog-eared exercise books. It is one of the many strange scenes in Havana of micro-capitalism at work \u2013 which clearly won\u2019t be micro for much longer.\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion", "date_time": "2016-02-01T07:00:22", "author": "Oliver Wainwright", "lang": "en", "topic": "Cities|Americas|Havana holidays|Real estate|Cuba holidays|Caribbean holidays|features", "category": "world|americas", "title": "Cuba for sale: \u2018Havana is now the big cake - and everyone is trying to get a slice\u2019", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Property developers are queuing up to pounce as Cuba opens its doors to the world.

The latest figures from Colombia, released over the weekend, backed her analysis, showing 20,297 confirmed cases of the disease in the South American country, including 2,116 pregnant women, making it the second most affected country after Brazil.\nAccording to Colombian officials, the number of pregnant women confirmed to be affected has doubled in a week.\nIn Brazil, Zika has been linked, although not definitively so, to 4,000 cases of microcephaly, in which babies are born with smaller than normal heads, raising global fears about a virus that was previously considered relatively benign.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Revellers march at pre-carnival celebrations in Recife, Brazil.

The fact that some people developed neurological symptoms and the impact on the foetus were also a concern.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Piot added: \u201cWHO clearly dropped the ball when it came to responding to the Ebola virus. It took about five months to declare the Ebola virus in west Africa as a public health emergency of international concern. Today that [WHO] committee is meeting and I have all confidence that they will declare this as a public health emergency. Several reports have been published [on the response to Ebola] and the WHO can, and must, do better.\u201d\nPiot said there was little danger of Zika spreading to the UK. \u201cZika and Ebola are different. The mode of transmission is different, that\u2019s why I\u2019m not concerned for the UK. There is no way that the aedes mosquito can spread here, it is too cold.\u201d\nLawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University in Washington, US, who has worked with WHO and written extensively about pandemics and policy, said Zika should have been declared an emergency as soon as the link between the virus and microcephaly was made. \u201cMy chief criticism is of WHO in Geneva,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cAfter being widely condemned for acting late on Ebola, it is now sitting back with Zika.\u201d\nBut officials at WHO, the United Nations health organisation, say the precise nature of any link between Zika and microcephaly remains unclear.\nAlthough the disease does not pose the same threat to life as Ebola, and there has only been one case of possible person-to-person sexual transmission, according to the WHO, experts have warned that Zika poses a serious threat because of a number of its characteristics. These include the fact that an estimated 80% of infected people do not have any symptoms and that there is no vaccine in prospect.\nThe Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that transmit the virus thrive in urban conditions and are spreading as global warming takes effect.\nAn Indonesian research institute said on Sunday that it had found one confirmed Zika case on Sumatra island in a 27-year-old man who had never travelled overseas. The virus has previously been detected in a small number of people in south-east Asia, including one case in Indonesia, reports suggest.

Hundreds of tonnes of unprocessed waste flow into the Guanabara Bay every year. The problem isn\u2019t new but the prospect of Olympic swimmers and sailors taking to Rio\u2019s contaminated waters have put the issue in the spotlight.\nPrevious promises from Rio officials to \u201cregenerate Rio\u2019s magnificent waterways\u201d through investment in sanitation have not delivered results. Could the Dutch environment ministry have better luck? In an ambitious and diplomatically unorthodox move it has pulled together some of the country\u2019s leading waste experts, including businesses and NGOs, to propose a variety of innovative solutions under the name Clean Urban Delta Initiative [pdf].\nAthletes at Rio Olympics to compete in 'basically raw sewage', study reveals Read more\n\u201cGuanabara Bay is so polluted that we need all hands on deck to solve this sooner rather than later,\u201d says Yvon Wolthuis, a sustainability expert and co-developer of the Clean Urban Delta Initiative. \u201cPlus, there\u2019s so much happening in an urban bay environment like Rio that you can\u2019t just rely on one governance model or technology to fix it.\u201d\nThe initiative has backing from the World Bank and the Dutch Development Bank and aims to showcase Dutch water management expertise. It lays out 20 separate proposals to deal with Guanabara Bay\u2019s water pollution and solid waste challenges.\nThe list of proposed solutions ranges from installing temporary water treatment plants and purifying water via \u201cconstructed wetlands\u201d to creating carpets from recovered nylon fishing nets. The ideas put forward by the consortium are intended to be low-cost, high impact and quick to implement, says Wolthius.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dead fish found near the Rio Olympic sailing venue. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\nOne of these proposed solutions is a project to help Rio\u2019s litter pickers get more value from plastic waste. Based on a collaboration between a group of local designers, environmental charity WWF and the non-profit Plastic Soup Foundation, the project revolves around a low-cost plastic shredder and moulding machine that waste pickers can use to make recyclable products like plastic statues.\nAn initial pilot is planned in a favela community on the Carioca River, close to the city\u2019s iconic Christ the Redeemer statue. Dani\u00ebl Poolen (nicknamed the \u201cEco Prof\u201d thanks to a science show he presents on Dutch TV) is one of the driving forces behind the project. \u201cThousands of tourists climb up the hill beside this community every day,\u201d says Poolen, \u201cif the waste pickers can shred and mould the plastics they usually sell on, they can earn ten or twenty times what they earn now.\u201d\nHe concedes that the Carioca River is only one of about 18 garbage-choked rivers that feed into Guanabara Bay. However, if local people see that money can be made by recycling plastic that would otherwise end up in the river, then they will be incentivizsed to do the same along Rio\u2019s other river tributaries too, he says.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Statue of Christ the Redeemer, Corcovado, Rio de Janeiro. Photograph: Alamy\nThe problem is money. The price-tag for the litter picker scheme \u2013 which also includes an eco-trail along the Carioca River, with local people offering paid tours, and the renovation of Rio\u2019s key water basins \u2013 is about 4m real (\u00a3700,000). Yet Brazil is suffering its worst recession for decades and Rio\u2019s state government, which is responsible for the Guanabara Bay\u2019s clean-up, is struggling. As a result, the Plastic Soup Foundation is having to search out private funds to get the project off the ground.\nDutch dredging company Royal IHC, a member of the consortium, has run into a similar barrier. It has developed a low-cost, versatile vessel specifically designed for urban bay areas such as Guanabara. The catamaran-style \u201cwaste harvester\u201d uses a system of interchangeable barges and on-board storage to continuously harvest surface waste without having to frequently return to shore to unload.\n\u201cWe hoped that Rio would be a good case study to pilot this new technology, but the funding isn\u2019t there\u201d, says company spokersperson Marjolein van Noort.\nAnother consortium member, Dutch engineering consultancy firm Tauw, experienced similar difficulties. Its solution is based on the construction of small polypropylene tubes on the riverbed and a permeable grid above that catch and store floating rubbish. Despite interest from the Rio state government, the funding to install the firm\u2019s \u201ceco-barrier\u201d wasn\u2019t forthcoming.\nHenry Raben, head of site development at Tauw, estimates that installing the system on the six most polluted rivers feeding into the bay would cost about \u00a34.6m. \u201cBut the clock is now running. To be ready for the Olympics, we\u2019d ideally have installed the geotubes about six months ago.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man walks along the shoreline of the polluted Guanabara Bay. Photograph: Buda Mendes/Getty Images\nBrazil is a \u201cvery complex\u201d market, says Wolthuis, who takes heart from the fact that the Dutch consortium\u2019s package of solutions offers a template for clean-up efforts in other polluted deltas around the world.\n\u201cOur focus has been on Rio, but these ideas could just as easily be applied to Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta or Abidjan.

These shanty towns are often in locations highly susceptible to the effects of extreme climate events.\nMy name is Kary Stewart and this month I visit Chosica, on the outskirts of Lima, and Piura, in the north of the country, to find out more about how the residents are dealing with the consequences of El Ni\u00f1o.\nWZ My name is William Zegarra and I work for the NGO Practical Action here in Chosica. Now we are in the area of San Fernando. This is the R\u00edmac river, our famous R\u00edmac river.\nKS We\u2019re in San Fernando in the district of Chosica on the outskirts of Lima province, a about an hour from the capital\u2019s centre. The poorer inhabitants live in the valley along the river R\u00edmac and on the mountainside, and sometimes in the creeks themselves, mostly in basic structures built from brick and scrap material. When the heavy rains come every year in around March the area becomes susceptible to both landslides, which plummet down from the creeks in the mountains, and also to floods from the river bursting its banks.\nWZ In 1987-88 we had El Ni\u00f1o and there was a lot of damage and victims because people hadn\u2019t experienced landslides before and there hadn\u2019t been any type of preparation. The whole risk management and civil defence system was very basic, practically non-existent in this area. Since then we have had the landslides every two or three years.\nBitter winters for Peru's alpaca farmers combating climate change | Sam Jones Read more\nGP My name is Gabriela Perez. I am 16 years old and I live in Chosica on the outskirts of Lima. Where I live in Rayos del Sol there was a landslide last year. It come down through the mountain gorge where we least expected it, because seven years ago there was a landslide that came down from another part of the mountain and that\u2019s where we expected it. The lady that collects recyclable goods lived in the path of the landslide. She wasn\u2019t home but her daughter was there with her baby and her brother. That was the first family that suffered the effects of the landslide; and, unfortunately, many families lost their lives apart from them.\nKS Manuel Pulgar-Vidal is the minister of the environment for Peru. He\u2019s not so sure that El Ni\u00f1o was responsible for last year\u2019s landslide, in which nine people lost their lives and six others went missing.\nMP-V Nobody knows exactly if it were a problem with El Ni\u00f1o or some kind of winds with rain and clouds that came from the southern Antarctic part of the continent. Unfortunately poor people used to set their houses in those creeks, in the most vulnerable creeks. I think that we still have not really understood the risk that we are assuming when we put our house in that place.\nKS Piura is in the far north of the country, and is set on desert scrub land. The shanty towns around the river Piura and beyond are highly vulnerable to the effects of flooding caused by heavy rains. Felix Zapata from NGO Practical Action works with the local community to help prepare them for the effects of El Ni\u00f1o.\nFZ We have been working in three districts and in four communities. In the district of the 26 de Octubre we are working in Los Polvorines which is also an area that when the water level of the river rises it\u2019s a lost area; and also in two other shanty towns. So the work that we have done in this area is [to] set up an irrigation route, making it wider and we have also built a retaining wall and have widened the entrance [so] the doctors, ambulances and the first response teams have easy access, and also so people can evacuate.\nJN My name is Jenny Nesama. I also work for Practical Action in Piura. Los Polvorines is a shanty town that has been there for about 15 years and is growing. This is one of the most critical locations because it has been built on what used to be a lake, which means the soil isn\u2019t the most sturdy. It is also where the natural drainage system used to run which used to offload the rainwater until it was invaded 15 years ago and now the people don\u2019t want to leave.\nKS Invasiones or invasions is a term used to describe the act of illegally settling on a piece of land. Typically most invasions are on land that has no clear owner, often because of its precarious location \u2013 such as near rivers, drainage systems or mountains which make them vulnerable to extreme conditions such as those caused by El Ni\u00f1o.\nJN We have been working on prevention techniques with the people. If they are prepared this might at least save lives in the event of strong rains. We know that as an NGO it is not our responsibility to get them to leave the land; that is the municipality\u2019s responsibility and also a much more complicated issue.\nKS The district known as 26 de Octubre is an area settled through invasions and is currently in the process of becoming recognised as a formal town. Ana Chandovisi Esquen is president of the local organisation that looks after the residents\u2019 rights. And she\u2019s a well-known figurehead in the local area. I went to meet her at her home deep within the slums.\nACE I\u2019ve been here for seven years. Others have been here for 11 years. There are around 700 plots; around 1,500 families multiplied by three or four would give you the inhabitants although some families are bigger. Life is a bit difficult here. There was one time when they wanted to evict us and that\u2019s why they came to do a census as a trick. But as a leader we know how a census works and nobody can come and cheat us.\nKS The cluster of villages where Ana lives huddle around a drain that comes from the city of Piura. The rainwater drain is called Victor Maldonado. It deposits its waters into the Santa Julia lake and eventually into the sea.\nEAG My name is Eduardo Angulo Gonzalez. I\u2019m the head of the department of the regional office for security and national defence. Our houses are located in low areas. In order to raise their homes to above flooding level they pile up the soil with construction material and say: \u201cThere, I\u2019ve piled it up to the necessary height.\u201d But when there are floods this material gets soaked anyway and [water] gets to the foundation of the houses which are made with the basic materials. The result is that the houses crumble. All these families are going to have problems when it rains. What they have to do is leave.\nThe humidity level of the soil there is very high, which isn\u2019t good for the health of the children. All these people here are going to suffer with floods. The problem is that people are used to living close to the city, so if you offered them a safe plot two, three, 10 kilometres away, they don\u2019t want to go there.\nACE We\u2019re right next to the Los Patos lake. We can see a lot of contamination \u2013 building material. We\u2019re in a shanty town, Armando Villanuevo del Campo, with a representative, Mr Leiter.\nML Of course, right now El Ni\u00f1o hasn\u2019t happened but there is a possibility it could happen in March. And you can see that this part would be most affected. If this lake fills up the water will come this way and could bring disease. It should not be stagnant, it should run freely.\nKS Back in Lima I asked Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the minister of the environment, why he thought people made their homes in these areas, despite knowing the risks.\nPeru harnesses ancient canal system to tackle Lima water shortage | Dan Collyns Read more\nMP-V This social phenomenon of invasion \u2013 it is related first to poor people who migrate mostly from the Andean part of the country, that is where the poorest people live. The cost of the land it is quite expensive for them so they are used to seeking outside the urban area or the main part of the urban area. Most of the time they are seeking to invade areas in which there are some probably lack of information [about] the owner, because if there is an owner obviously that owner is going to defend their land. So that is why they are used to going to the hills or close to the river, to the basin, and unfortunately [they] are the risk areas of our geography.\nYou know that when you are in poor conditions because of your economy, because of your way of life \u2013 that unfortunately your vision is a short-term vision. So that is why the people quickly forget the last El Ni\u00f1o and forget the risks because they need to have some place. They need to continue their activities, so that is why it is very difficult.\nIt is like, for example, the illegal mining. The people know that they are polluting the rivers and they are also creating a pollution problem with mercury. Yes, they know. But they think that probably in the future when they are with better life conditions they can deal with that. So it is a balance that is a trade-off. Now we need to have a house, economic activity \u2026 I know that there are some risks but they are used to assuming that risk. And that is sad because they know that they can suffer really bad consequences and [are] putting at risk their own life.\nKS So in terms of the government, whose responsibility is all this?\nMP-V You know that it is related to the land and to that kind of settlement. It is not related to the national government but to local government. So the local government needs to be more strong to have forbidden areas because they need to protect their own population. I think that one of the problems of Piura is that there are a lot of economic activities but based in an informal system. So that is why it is very difficult to adopt or to have a standard procedure to deal with the consequences of El Ni\u00f1o. You should go settlement by settlement to try and identify what kind of consequences they could have.\nKS In Piura as in many vulnerable shanty districts the residents have become very proactive organising their own risk prevention techniques and learning about their rights.\nJRP My name is Johans Rodriguez Purisaca.

We also receive information from the Estudio Nacional del Fen\u00f3meno El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 Enfen. Six months ago they expected El Ni\u00f1o to be strong with disastrous effects. So it now has been changed into moderate, which means it won\u2019t be a harmful event but it will rain.\nKS The complex issues around illegal settlers are seemingly a long way from resolution. In the meantime, however, work continues to both manage risk and prevent disaster.\nMP-V Even though we have received this good news that probably we are going to not have a strong El Ni\u00f1o, still we are working with a lot of money in preventive measures. The second measure is how we are going to manage an emergency. And the third part is to manage the rehabilitation in case we suffer the consequences, and a relocation, if it\u2019s needed.\nPeru's fog catchers net water supplies | Dan Collyns Read more\nKS The regional governor of Piura.\nRH We work on risk prevention on three levels: the national government; the regional government, who I represent as the governor; and the local government. The rural area is the responsibility of the national government and the agriculture ministry. On a local level in the cities it\u2019s our job to clean the city drains which are the rain drains. We\u2019re working on this with the help of the mayors and the housing ministry.\nKS Back in Chosica the local residents are not convinced that the risk prevention work that the local authorities are doing is enough. Ana Ninahuanca G\u00f3mez is the president of the local residents\u2019 group.\nANG Concerning the contingency plan, the local government hasn\u2019t put anything forward. There have only been some minor training courses about that. So right now, the inhabitants themselves have their own contingency plan. If a landslide comes, they will go to higher areas for safety. We\u2019re waiting for the authorities, the local authorities as well as the Lima regional authorities, because they were supposed to work on the dykes, and so far they haven\u2019t. It\u2019s only been the central government that has been putting the wire nets in, and getting money for the walls. We really don\u2019t know what will become of the most vulnerable people when the rains start in March. We\u2019re very worried.\nWe do feel a little more ready, because several organisations have come to prepare us on how to protect ourselves, in the event of a large landslide; what measures we could take. We would like more training for the communities, to know how to safeguard our lives, and those of our loved ones, and our neighbours and the elderly.\nKS 16-year-old Gabriela Perez.\nGP Apart from the fact that we learn how to raise awareness we are also learning that we have rights. The government could send us many things but you know there is a lot of bureaucracy, and essential goods don\u2019t get here. That\u2019s the reality for us. When they send supplies, they send beans and things like that. Can a six-month-old baby eat that? No. They have to eat baby food. In those moments all the shops close and the demand increases. We need to buy things but there\u2019s nowhere to buy them. These are the things that I have been talking about with my peers and I know that we have to defend our rights.\nKS So is it possible to forecast an El Ni\u00f1o?\nMP-V No, no \u2013 who knows? You know that unfortunately the last statistics show that El Ni\u00f1o can appear every seven to 10 years. In the past it has been a larger time than current. So that is why we should be very, very aware that we can suffer continually that kind of effect.\nKS In a country like Peru with so much institutional and cultural complexity, the work of trying to reduce the risk and protect the population from El Ni\u00f1o and other natural disasters is ongoing. Reynaldo Hilbert, the regional governor of Piura.\nHunger threatens millions as El Ni\u00f1o causes drought and floods Read more\nRH What we\u2019re doing now is recovering from the 1998 El Ni\u00f1o. The cities, the countryside and the highways are just as vulnerable as they were in 1998. I believe that if we want to overcome this problem we have to carry out major infrastructure improvements. El Ni\u00f1o is no longer a phenomenon. A phenomenon is every 500 years; and the El Ni\u00f1o event happens often now. During the past 30 years two of them have been very strong but in between we\u2019ve had a lot of heavy rains. We now have to live with this event and we have to be prepared.\nKS I\u2019m Kary Stewart and that\u2019s all for this month\u2019s Global development podcast.

We asked those who headed north if the grass really was greener\nIn November 2004, David Drucker and his wife Pam were at home listening to NPR when they heard the news that would change their lives: George W Bush had been re-elected as president of the United States.\nCanada considers changing national anthem to include country's women Read more\nIn the lead-up to election day, the couple had made a pact: if John Kerry won, they would build their dream house in Vermont; if he lost, they would move to Canada. A year later, they were on their way to Vancouver to start their new lives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a little over a decade now. We have clear eyes about what we did. We have no intention of going back,\u201d Drucker said.\nThe Druckers were not alone. On election day in 2004, a record-setting 179,000 people visited Canada\u2019s official immigration website, the majority of them Americans. And as anxieties about the outcome of 2016 begin to grow, some Americans are again musing about fleeing to their northern neighbor.\nIn September, the digital analytics firm Luminoso found about 4% of 4.5 million Donald Trump-related tweets contained threats to leave the country if the billionaire became president. Of those, 25,000 identified Canada as their intended destination. Since then, comedian and Obama \u201canger translator\u201d Keegan-Michael Key has joined the chorus. Even former USdefense secretary Robert Gates joked about emigrating if Trump took office.\nTalking about relocating to Canada clearly is pretty trendy \u2013 actually relocating there, not so much. According to the Canadian government, the number of new US immigrants arriving in the country has remained relatively stable \u2013 about 9,000 annually \u2013 from 2005 to 2014. It might not be the northern utopia of their dreams, but those who have made the move say they have never regretted it.\n\u201cIf Americans want to live in a country where there is an investment in public education, where people aren\u2019t afraid of going bankrupt because they get sick, and where democracy is taken seriously, they should move, because an alternative exists,\u201d said Tom Kertes, 43, who moved from Seattle to Canada with his now husband Ron Braun in 2007.\nKertes and Braun had been thinking of Canada since the invasion of Iraq and the US government began using \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d on detainees. But they actually started browsing the Canadian immigration website the night they heard Bush propose a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage during his State of the Union address in 2005. They applied for Canadian permanent residency in 2006 and and now live in British Columbia.\nJim DeLaHunt left an engineering management position with Adobe in California for uncertain prospects in Canada after Bush\u2019s re-election. Leaving behind his country\u2019s penchant for authoritarianism, war and inequality, he says, was the right call.\nDeLaHunt, now a tech consultant, misses the scale and ambition of the technology industry in the United States, but says he wouldn\u2019t trade life in Vancouver to go back to it. He and his wife integrated easily into Canadian society, he said, learning how to be \u201cless arrogant and a bit more gentle\u201d, and even picking up local etiquette and speech patterns.\n\u201cCanadians say \u2018sorry\u2019 a lot more than people in the US do. They thank the bus driver as they get off the bus. In the US, if someone says \u2018thank you\u2019 a typical response might be \u2018sure\u2019. That seems awfully brusque in Canada. A better response is, \u2018No worries.\u2019 There\u2019s little things like that, and if you get those things right you blend in on a day-to-day level,\u201d he said.\nWriter Lee Rowan, 63, and her wife, on the other hand, have found Canada to be more similar to the United States than they would like. In 2007 they moved from Ohio, which three years earlier had banned same-sex marriage, to Ontario, one of the world\u2019s first jurisdictions to legalize it. But in the Waterloo region, where they settled, their neighbors turned out to be more conservative, and less tolerant, than they had hoped.\n\u201cI\u2019d say there\u2019s some Canadian homophobia. If we had kids or had been churchgoers I doubt it would have been an issue,\u201d Rowan said.\nWatching Trump\u2019s rise, in particular, has been disconcerting to Rowan. Still, she\u2019s keeping an eye on the political climate in the US. If the conditions are right, she says, she would consider moving back.\nFor Laura Kaminker, however, that\u2019s completely out of the question. In the 20 years before she and her partner Allan Wood finally moved to Canada from New York City in 2005, she had \u201clost hope\u201d in the country she saw plagued by \u201ccivil liberties crackdowns\u201d and \u201cendless wars\u201d. Although she still has her American citizenship, she doesn\u2019t vote any more in US elections, and whenever she comes back to Canada after visiting family or friends in the States, she breathes a sigh of relief.\n\u201cEvery time I say, \u2018God, I\u2019m so glad to be out of that crazy country,\u2019\u201d she said.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T14:48:43", "author": "Jordan G Teicher", "lang": "en", "topic": "US elections 2016|Canada|Americas|US politics|features", "category": "world|americas", "title": "'An alternative exists': the US citizens who vowed to flee to Canada - and did", "source": "guardian", "intro": "It happens every election cycle: Americans threaten to move if the wrong person gets elected.

{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/31/jian-ghomeshi-cbc-radio-host-sexual-assault-trial-toronto-canada", "content": "Former star has faced accusations from more than 20 people before a Toronto trial that has highlighted concerns about Canada\u2019s handling of past cases\nFormer radio star Jian Ghomeshi will appear in Toronto\u2019s Old City Hall courtroom on Monday for the first trial to emerge from a barrage of accusations that the disgraced celebrity subjected multiple women to violent acts of sexual assault.\nThe accusations stunned millions of fans of the popular folk artist turned radio personality and his hugely popular program with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Q. The culture and current events show loomed large in Canadian entertainment and attracted a substantial following in the US. Ghomeshi, at once an engaging and an easygoing interviewer, attracted a broad range of guests: Jon Stewart, Paul McCartney, Jay-Z, Michael Moore, Werner Herzog, Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s GZA, and Brian Wilson. His show was one of the CBC\u2019s most successful.\nAccusations against the celebrity host burst into public view in late October 2014. On 26 October, the Toronto Star published disturbing accounts from three unnamed women who claimed Ghomeshi had attacked them on dates.\nThe women told broadly consistent stories of abuse. Ghomeshi started out sweet and flirty but soon alluded to \u201cviolent sex acts\u201d. \u201cWhen they failed to respond or expressed displeasure, they recalled Ghomeshi dismissing his remarks as \u2018just fantasies\u2019, reassuring them he wouldn\u2019t ask them to do anything they weren\u2019t comfortable with,\u201d the Star reported.\nCanadian public broadcaster's crisis: 'When you create celebrities, you create monsters' Read more\nGhomeshi eventually slapped, punched, bit, choked, or smothered them, the women claimed. One of the women said Ghomeshi choked her almost to the point of unconsciousness. Another said she struggled to breathe as he covered her nose and mouth.\nA fourth woman, who was employed at the CBC, claimed Ghomeshi touched her buttocks at the office and told her: \u201cI want to hate-fuck you.\u201d She reported his actions to her union, which made the CBC aware of her complaints. The employee, who later allowed press to publicly identify her as former Q staffer Kathryn Borel, says she quit the radio show because of CBC\u2019s lackluster response.\nThe report, which was the product of a months-long investigation, followed three days of turmoil among higher-ups at the CBC. Ghomeshi had told network executives about the possibility of a news article that he claimed would distort his private life. On 24 October, the network announced that Ghomeshi was taking an indefinite leave of absence \u201cto deal with some personal issues\u201d. Two days later, and just hours before the Star story was published, the CBC announced that it had fired Ghomeshi because of \u201cinformation\u201d that \u201cprecluded\u201d employing him further.\nGhomeshi was quick with a public response to his firing. In an emotional Facebook post that has since disappeared, he accused \u201ca jilted ex girlfriend\u201d of falsely portraying their rough but consensual sex as abusive to members of the media. Ghomeshi informed the CBC that \u201csomeone was reframing what had been an ongoing consensual relationship as something nefarious\u201d, he wrote, and showed executives evidence of consent. It later came out that Ghomeshi had showed them video of a bruised woman, evidently injured with a broken rib, whom he said he had dated. He said the injuries were from consensual activities.\nIn his post, Ghomeshi claimed the network fired him because the behavior was unbecoming and any news story could give the impression of abuse. \u201cLet me be the first to say that my tastes in the bedroom may not be palatable to some folks,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut that is my private life \u2026 And no one, and certainly no employer, should have dominion over what people do consensually in their private life.\u201d\nThe Star report followed later that day.\nThe next few weeks brought a surge of similar allegations against Ghomeshi. Within days, four more alleged victims had identified themselves to the press or police. Within a month, the accusers numbered more than twenty, including several who agreed to make their identities public. Numerous women and one man accused Ghomeshi of behavior that ranged from forceful groping and unwanted touching to punching and choking. Several accusers said he punched or choked them without warning. The incidents allegedly took place between the years of 1988 and 2013 \u2013 dating to his time in college and his career as the frontman for Moxy Fr\u00fcvous, a beloved pop-folk band.\n\u201cI was surprised by how violent the allegations against him were,\u201d Jim Hounslow, an employee of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg and one of Ghomeshi\u2019s accusers, told the Guardian. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t shocked by how many. I was really expecting more allegations to come out.\u201d\nGhomeshi sued the CBC for $55m the day after his firing. He withdrew his lawsuit a month later following an undisclosed agreement with the network.\nOn 26 November, Ghomeshi turned himself in to Toronto police and was charged with four counts of sexual assault and one count of \u201covercome resistance\u201d by choking. Ghomeshi was released on bail. Prosecutors added three more charges of sexual assault in January, and dropped two in May, citing a likelihood that they could not secure convictions.\nThe remaining charges stem from accusations by four different women. Only one of the women has shared her name with the public: Lucy DeCoutere, an actor on the TV comedy Trailer Park Boys. DeCoutere met Ghomeshi at a TV festival and went on a date with him in 2003. The two were kissing at his house, she has said, when he turned violent. \u201cHe did take me by the throat and press me against the wall and choke me,\u201d DeCoutere said. \u201cAnd he did slap me across the face a couple of times.\u201d\nOn Monday, Ghomeshi will face the first of two criminal trials before the Ontario court of justice, for the choking charge and four counts of sexual assault. Ghomeshi has pleaded not guilty to all counts. His attorney did not respond to requests for comment.\nA test of the legal system\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The accusations against the former radio host have highlighted concerns about Canada\u2019s past handling of sexual assault cases. Photograph: Keith Beaty/Getty Images\nAs the Ghomeshi case moves into the trial phase, observers are wondering where it will fit into Canada\u2019s troubled history of handling sexual assault cases.\nThe accusations against Ghomeshi have renewed attention to the barriers and stigma facing those who make allegations of sexual violence. Many of the women who came forward, for instance, accused Ghomeshi of assaulting them ten or twenty years ago. They said they didn\u2019t feel law enforcement would act on their complaints. Several said they were afraid to be named. Those women cited a 2013 piece by Carla Ciccone on the website XOJane, describing her \u201cbad date\u201d with a radio host who touched her despite her objections. Ciccone did not identify Ghomeshi by name. Still, legions of his fans singled her out for vitriolic harassment on social media.\nAt least one Ghomeshi accuser was motivated to come forward by all that fear. Hounslow, who met Ghomeshi when the two were York University undergraduates, said he told the Toronto Star about his own alleged abuse out of a hope that he could encourage others to come forward. The two worked together in student government. Hounslow claimed that one night as they waited for an elevator, Ghomeshi grabbed his genitals and fondled them.\n\u201cI wanted to be supportive, to encourage others to come out,\u201d Hounslow told the Guardian. \u201cI also wanted to show that [Ghomeshi] had a history of assaulting people who worked with him \u2026 There was a long history of this behavior.\u201d\nLaw enforcement in Toronto seemed to move quickly and effectively at the first sign that Ghomeshi could be a serial sex offender. In an unusual move, the chief of police invited victims to make formal complaints.\nBut the Canadian courts bear a long history of brutal cross-examinations of women claiming sexual assault. Appellate courts have repeatedly restrained trial judges from intervening in cross-examination, said Janine Benedet, a law professor at the University of British Columbia.\n\u201cIn sexual assault cases, there has been a really troubling history of defense counsel resorting to what are often impermissible inferences \u2013 trying to bring in sexual history without proper application, trying to rely on the fact the complainant didn\u2019t disclose right away, or should have fought back,\u201d Benedet continued.\nIndeed, news reports have noted that many of Ghomeshi\u2019s accusers maintained contact with him or waited long periods of time after the alleged abuse to report to law enforcement. These are normal behaviors for victims of abuse that can nevertheless appear to undermine their stories.\nJian Ghomeshi harassed me on the job. Why did our radio station look the other way? | Kathryn Borel Read more\nBeyond the courtroom, the accusations have prompted scrutiny of Ghomeshi\u2019s former employer. As early as 2012, CBC management received repeated complaints of inappropriate workplace behavior.\nSeveral former and current CBC employees have said the network did little to act on those reports. The summer before Ghomeshi\u2019s accusers went public, a network executive had conducted an investigation into his conduct that found no evidence of wrongdoing.\nIn January 2015, however, CBC put that executive, Chris Boyce, and Todd Spencer, head of human resources, on leave. That May, investigators commissioned by CBC released a report that excoriated upper management for mishandling complaints as Ghomeshi\u2019s star rose. CBC announced that it would end its relationships with Boyce and Spencer. In March, the CBC announced that it would replace Ghomeshi with the rapper Shad.\nThe allegations fractured a wide circle of friends, artists, and admirers who surrounded Ghomeshi and resulted in a sometimes vicious debate about the women\u2019s credibility. Many immediately used social media to insist on his innocence. Others were vocal about their belief in the victims. \u201cJian is my friend,\u201d Owen Pallett, an indie musician, wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cBut there is no grey area here.\u201d\nGhomeshi has maintained his innocence since the first of the allegations in 2014 and repeatedly suggested that any contact he had with his accusers was consensual. At one point, his attorneys told the Star that messages between Ghomeshi and a woman he believed to be a Star source would prove that all their contact was consensual, but they declined to share the messages.\nJust before he was charged, Ghomeshi added the prominent defense attorney Marie Henein to his team of attorneys. Henein, whom former clients have described as \u201cmy shark\u201d and a person who \u201cseemed to channel Hannibal Lecter\u201d, has a reputation for ruthlessness. To many, the choice signals that Ghomeshi\u2019s accusers will face ferocious cross-examination.\nHounslow, who accuses Ghomeshi of assaulting him as a student, will be following the trial. But he thinks about the tidal wave of accusations less than he did last year.\n\u201cI just felt sickened for a couple of weeks,\u201d he recalled. \u201cNauseous and worried about the people I knew who had dated him.\u201d But as more women came forward, his worries turned into empathy and admiration. \u201cSome of them are just very brave to put their names and faces out there in connection with these charges,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt it was all very cathartic.\u201d", "date_time": "2016-02-01T15:07:18", "author": "Molly Redden|John Barber", "lang": "en", "topic": "Canada|Americas|Radio|Rape and sexual assault|news", "category": "world|americas", "title": "Trial of ex-radio host Jian Ghomeshi begins for series of sexual assault claims", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Former star has faced accusations from more than 20 people before a Toronto trial that has highlighted concerns about Canada\u2019s handling of past cases"},

Fifteen Mayan peasant leaders in the tiny hamlet of Sepur Zarco in eastern Guatemala were seized and killed or forcibly disappeared.\nA few weeks later, they came back for the women.

Montt and his co-accused are currently awaiting retrial.\nGuatemala\u2019s 1960-1996 civil was triggered by a CIA-backed coup after a democratically elected president promised land reforms. R\u00edos Montt justified the state-sponsored violence by claiming the victims were communist guerrillas. But army actions were largely about protecting the interests of rich landowners.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Indigenous women of the Mayan ethnic Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 group cover their faces during a hearing for the Sepur Zarco case in Guatemala City in June 2015.

They attracted national and international attention when they were first reported in the Buffalo News last week.\nThe proposal has shocked and excited some residents of the town of Niagara Falls, many of whom were not around the only other time the Falls went quiet.\n\u201cThe historian in me is excited to witness this,\u201d says Michelle Kratts, a former Nigara Falls historian, who wasn\u2019t yet born when Niagara\u2019s American water was diverted the first time round, in June 1969, for nearly five months.\nNewspaper reports from the time say throngs of tourists turned up to watch the event. Coins that visitors had thrown into the falls over the years had to be gathered and taken away by the bucket load.\nTwo cadavers were also found \u2013 one of a man who was later identified, another of a woman whose body was found lodged in between two rocks halfway down the approximate 100ft newly bare fall. Her identity was never discovered.\nAs grim as the discoveries were, residents say that, if anything, they were surprised the number of bodies found wasn\u2019t greater. That the falls are a destination place for people wishing to end their lives is a painful, open secret locally. Often, bodies are never recovered.\n\u201cA lot of people here have witnessed people go in,\u201d says Kratts, referring to people either committing suicide, attempting daredevil stunts, or falling because of lack of caution.\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary. It stays with you.\u201d\nAside from the tragedies revealed, when it came to the aesthetics of the event, locals remember being quite underwhelmed.\n\u201cIt was just a lot of rocks,\u201d Rick Lecksell, a Seneca Casino employee who was a teenager at the time, says flatly.\nWill the next planned dewatering manage to create positive publicity and enthusiasm? Officials certainly hope so.\nAt a public hearing organized by New York State Parks and the state\u2019s department of transportation, 100 or so residents, city and state park officials, engineers and members of the press gathered in the Niagara Falls Conference Center for a public hearing on the dewatering plans. Two current options for bridge repair provide for the dewatering to either last five or nine months.\n\u201cThis is an enormous opportunity,\u201d declared John Percy, the president and CEO of Niagara Tourism and Convention Corporation. \u201c [The dewatering of the American Niagara Falls] will gain worldwide attention. Tourism will be benefited.\u201d\nPercy pointed out that at least one of the two plans being considered involves the American falls being turned off between August and December, a period of the year during which tourism wanes anyway.\nPeople attracted by the lure of witnessing what lies beneath when the falls are halted may end up coming in greater numbers in those \u201cshoulder months\u201d than if the water was still flowing, the thought seemed to go.\nIn 1969, reports show tourists expressing thrill and amazement at feeling they were part of a unique, historical moment.\nExport bar placed on first eyewitness painting of Niagara Falls Read more\nBut the New York department of commerce still had to get involved to sell it as a \u201conce in a lifetime trip\u201d in order to get excitement levels up and convince potential visitors to still make the trip.\nIn a similar vein, Percy said he looked forward to working in coordination with state, park and city officials to devise the \u201cright messaging\u201d around the dewatering. He expressed a will to ensure visitors during the water-bare months are given as much access to stripped sites as possible.\nWithin the community, people seem mostly in favor of the dewatering plans to restore the bridges, but some \u2013 including environmentalists and members of the Native American community are far less excited.\nIn 1969, almost all of the trees on the dewatered riverbanks died of thirst within a month, it was reported.\n\u201cThere is a part of me that doesn\u2019t like to keep harnessing her,\u201d Kratts says, explaining she thinks of the river as a living thing.\n\u201cI go on the side of environmentalists. We have done so much to the river, diverting so much of her for power, electricity,\u201d she says referring to the massive, industrial-scale hydroelectric endeavors that have been consistently using the river\u2019s force, and diminishing it, since the late 19th century.\nNeil Patterson, a founder and director of the Tuscarora Nation\u2019s environment program, says there are a few thousand Haudenosaunee people, also referred to as Iroquois, living within 40 miles on the American side of the Niagara Falls, including on the Tuscarora reservation.\n\u201cThere is a real sense of ownership of these falls regardless of legal title,\u201d he says.\nHaudenosaunee people, who have never given up formal claims to the falls themselves, used to live on the river\u2019s shores and believe it is home to a thunder god, making the river an inextricable link to the \u201cthe sky world\u201d, he says.\n\u201cBut the notion of consultation about a place that has historic or cultural importance to indigenous people has not been complete since the dispossession of our territories going back to 1794,\u201d he says, describing the dewatering as \u201canother action in the colonization of water\u201d, which has been going on for centuries.\nPatterson points out that part of the appeal of the area for tourists from around the world is its Native American characteristics \u2013 peoples and traditions that have slowly, consistently and increasingly been marginalized, silenced, suffocated.\nOnce a booming industrial and tourist destination town, Niagara Falls, New York, is currently home to just 50,000 people, a quarter of whom live below the poverty line. It\u2019s a depressed combination of casino lights, chain hotels, and neglected, sometimes boarded-up housing. In the winter months, calling it a ghost town is no stretch.\nKratts says she wonders whether some of the sadness in the city is payback for what she ventures could be described as a rape of nature.\n\u201cThe city is so depressed. You wonder if we are being punished for it.

The choking count carries the steepest penalty, with the possibility of years in prison. A fourth sexual assault charge is the subject of a separate criminal trial due to begin this summer.\nThe charges represent accusations by four women. But nearly 20 individuals have come forward to law enforcement and media to accuse the former CBC star of violent sexual abuse. Ghomeshi denies all the charges, saying that any sexual activities with the women were consensual.\nGhomeshi\u2019s first accuser said she met Ghomeshi in late 2002, and went on two dates with him marked by escalating violence. For the first date, the two spent a half hour at a pub across the street from the set of Ghomeshi\u2019s CBC TV show, Play. Afterwards, he drove her to her car.\nShe was charmed, she said, that he drove a yellow Volkswagen beetle.\n\u201cI remember thinking he\u2019s funny, he\u2019s charming, he\u2019s intelligent, he opens doors,\u201d the woman testified. \u201cI thought he\u2019s a perfect gentleman. I thought, what a nice guy \u2026 He\u2019s driving a car that reminds me of a 1960s Disney movie \u2026 I\u2019m feeling very safe with him at the moment when I\u2019m with him.\u201d\nThe two briefly kissed in the front seat, she said, when without warning, Ghomeshi yanked her head back with a violent tug of her hair. \u201cIt was painful and sudden,\u201d she testified.\n\u201cHe said something along the lines of, \u2018Do you like it like that?\u2019 And I don\u2019t like that.\u201d Ghomeshi made a \u201cswitch back\u201d to his sweet demeanor, she said. She got into her own car not long after, she testified, wondering if he realized his own strength.\nTheir second one-on-one encounter, in the first week of January 2003, began when the woman and a friend attended another taping of Ghomeshi\u2019s show, she testified.\nAfter her friend went home, she and Ghomeshi went to his home in South Riverdale. The two flirted and kissed until Ghomeshi moved behind her and jerked her hair with force that brought her to her knees. He punched her in the right side of her head three times, she testified, with what felt like a closed fist.\n\u201cI\u2019m terrified, I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s doing this. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s gonna stop, can I take this pain? And my ears are ringing, and I thought I\u2019m going to faint.\u201d As she began to cry, Ghomeshi called her a cab and ordered her to leave, she said. She did not report her allegations to police until fall of 2014.\nThe accusations against Ghomeshi, which first emerged in fall 2014, stunned fans of the popular folk artist turned radio personality and his hugely popular program with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Q.\nThe culture and current events show was one of CBC\u2019s most successful programs, looming large in Canadian entertainment and attracting a substantial following in the US.

But the trial is also being scrutinized in the context of Canada\u2019s troubled history of handling sexual assault cases.\nVictims\u2019 advocates will be scrutinizing treatment of Ghomeshi\u2019s accusers, especially by the prominent defense lawyer Marie Henein who is leading Ghomeshi\u2019s team. On Monday, an overflow room held several criminal defense lawyers who came to watch Henein\u2019s cross-examinations.\nAlready, the proceedings have reflected the broad questions about sexual assault that are swirling around the trial, with the prosecution\u2019s first witness saying that stereotypes about accusers prevented her from going to the police with her accusations more than a decade ago.\n\u201cIt just didn\u2019t seem like anyone would do anything about it, or listen, or care,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t create the stigma about reporting sexual assault. But I am very aware.\u201d\nHenein hastened to cut off her statement. Before the court broke for lunch, Henein had begun to ask the woman pointed questions about how briefly police questioned her complaint of sexual assault, her media appearances to discuss her alleged assault, her level of excitement after a first date to see Ghomeshi again and her age.\n\u201cI think you would agree with me that you were a mature person?\u201d Henein asked.\nHenein indicated to the judge that she intended to question the witness about other times she called the police that year to establish \u201cshe knows how to pick up the phone and communicate with police\u201d.\nThe prosecutor\u2019s witness addressed her reticence to call the police in her testimony to the crown prosecutor. After the second alleged assault, she testified, she thought it was \u201ctoo late\u201d to call the police as soon as she left Ghomeshi\u2019s house.\n\u201cIt was just easier, I thought, to carry on and try to put it behind me as a bad experience,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to go home and curl up in a corner and cry, and the second reason is I didn\u2019t think that anyone would listen.\u201d\nFor an hour before the court took an afternoon recess, Henein launched an aggressive cross-examination of the witness. At one stage, there was a testy, 20-minute exchange on what caused the witness to misstate that she was wearing hair extensions when Ghomeshi allegedly yanked her hair.\nHenein suggested that Ghomeshi did not own the yellow car the witness remembered at the time of their first encounter, and she highlighted inconsistencies between her morning\u2019s testimony and the way she previously recounted her allegations to media and police.\nThe woman said that her recollections to police and the media did not come all in one burst. \u201cThis is new to me,\u201d she said. In one case, \u201cI was on national television. I was under pressure.\u201d\n\u201cIt was pressure that you chose,\u201d Henein replied.\nThe case continues.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T20:18:16", "author": "Molly Redden", "lang": "en", "topic": "Canada|Americas|news", "category": "world|americas", "title": "Jian Ghomeshi trial opens with first accuser: 'It was painful and sudden'", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Woman describes incidents with ex-radio host as first trial is also under scrutiny in the context of Canada\u2019s troubled history of handling sexual assault cases"},

It\u2019s not about a hunting expansion under the guise of a trial.\u201d\nDuck hunting season opens with tougher laws aimed at protesters Read more\nThe suggestion was put forward by Field and Game Australia (FGA) in a submission to the Game Management Authority\u2019s annual preseason consultation in December.\nIt said \u201csimplifying\u201d the duck hunting regulation by allowing a 12-week season with a daily bag limit of 10 ducks for a set number of years would \u201cpermit the collection of more accurate data\u201d, which could in turn inform the need for more restrictive hunting regulations.\n\u201cThis continued application of modifications to the 2015 hunting season has again prevented conclusions being drawn on the impact of hunting on sustainable waterfowl populations,\u201d the FGA\u2019s submission said. \u201cThis leaves conjecture as to whether environment, habitat or hunter participation contributed to the reduced harvest in 2015.\u201d\nDaily bag limits in the 2015 season were set at eight ducks on the opening day and five every day thereafter.\nThe bag limits for the 2016 season have been knocked down once more \u2013 eight birds on opening day, 19 March, and four a day for the rest of the 12-week season.\nAnnouncing the duck season dates last month, the Victorian agriculture minister, Jaala Pulford, said reduced bag limits were based on the GMA\u2019s advice about historically low bird numbers and low rainfall, which affected waterbird habitat.\nAccording to the GMA\u2019s briefing document, released in December, the wetland index was at its lowest ever level due to successive years with below-average rainfall and waterbird and game duck populations were at their second lowest levels on record.\nThe RSPCA, in its response to that briefing, said the combination of factors made this year \u201cone of the worst possible environments on record in which to hold a duck shooting season\u201d.\nVictoria\u2019s 26,000 licensed duck hunters reported killing 203,935 ducks in 2015, most of which were bagged on opening weekend. That figure does not include ducks that were injured but not retrieved, which the RSPCA suggested could be as high as one wounded for every one killed in some areas.\nThe chief executive of the RSPCA, Dr Liz Walker, said the organisation\u2019s position on the 2016 season went beyond its long-held opposition to any form of recreational hunting, saying \u201cwe have put the long-term survival of the species at risk\u201d.\nThe Victorian Labor party is also reportedly angry about the decision, which runs counter to the ban on all recreational wildlife hunting proposed by the party\u2019s environment policy committee before the 2014 election.\nThe Victorian Greens leader, Greg Barber, accused the Andrews government of political cowardice for refusing the cancel the duck hunting season, as happened in 2008 after a similarly dry winter.\n\u201cThey are more scared of the concentrated anger of 20,000 duck hunters than they are of the broader public opinion, which has said, again and again, that duck hunting should be banned,\u201d he said.\nHe said the economic benefit of the sport, mentioned by Pulford in her statement about the 2016 season dates, was overstated. According to a government report, duck hunting was worth $439m to the Victorian economy in 2013, a figure Barber said was based on the assumption that those who spent their money on a hunting trip would not spend it at all if shooting ducks was not an option.\nBarber said minutes of the GMA\u2019s meetings, obtained by the Greens under freedom of information, showed it was acting \u201clike a lobby group\u201d. The minutes, seen by Guardian Australia, show the GMA requested an \u201cactive role\u201d in decisions about whether water released for environmental flows aligned with hunting opportunities; mention the chief executive writing to Victorian police after hunters complained of their treatment by officers; and voted to recommend an extensive review of all state game reserves \u201cto determine by exception why all legal game and best animals cannot be hunted\u201d.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be a regulator and a promoter,\u201d Barber said.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T08:43:08", "author": "Calla Wahlquist", "lang": "en", "topic": "Victoria|Birds|Animal welfare|Wildlife|news", "category": "world|australia", "title": "Shooting lobby calls for five-year moratorium on duck hunting rules", "source": "guardian", "intro": "RSPCA says Field and Game Australia\u2019s suggestion \u2018unbelievable\u2019 after data showing decline in waterbirds in south-eastern Australia"},

The heart of the city has never fully recovered from the brazen 1970s bulldozing of the magnificent, 19th-century wrought-iron market pavilions at Les Halles and the creation, in their place, of an airless underground transport and shopping complex seen as a monstrous, mirror-glassed carbuncle.\nBut after decades of cultural spats, protests and political handwringing, the city is finally attempting to make amends. Later this spring, Paris will unveil an entirely reworked Les Halles crowned with one of the most ambitious architectural projects of the decade \u2013 a giant, undulating glass roof spanning 2.5 hectares, which hopes to literally put a lid on the problem.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Workers work on the building site of Les Halles. Photograph: Patrick Kovarik/AFP\nKnown as \u201cthe Canopy\u201d, the enormous, undulating roof is made up of 18,000 scale-like pieces of glass held in the air by 7,000 tonnes of steel at a cost of over \u20ac200m (\u00a3150m). It was designed to open up a new panorama across the city centre.\nAs the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, toured the structure amid the rush to finish work on the \u20ac1bn refurbishment before the opening in April, she vowed that the area she once described as an \u201curban catastrophe\u201d would now become \u201cthe beating heart\u201d of the capital.\nBut a history of errors and regrets still hangs heavy over the site.\nDesigners prepare Les Halles for a facelift Read more\nIn the mid-19th century, architect Victor Baltard created what was hailed as a masterpiece of wrought-iron pavilions to house the city\u2019s wholesale market, described by Emile Zola as \u201cthe belly of Paris\u201d. But the pavilions were bulldozed in the early 1970s. The giant gaping hole that was left there for years was so surreal that the Italian film director Marco Ferreri famously used it as the war-zone backdrop of his zany farce about the last stand of the American cavalry commander, Gen Custer.\nThe site was turned into a giant transport hub, with a massive intersection of suburban railway and metro lines that serves 750,000 passengers a day. It is Europe\u2019s biggest underground station, teamed with a giant subterranean shopping mall that has a footfall of 37 million people a year.\nBut until now, the complex was seen as so unappealing and difficult to find your way round that Parisians and tourists kept away if they could. Its reputation for petty drug-dealing made matters worse.\nThe refit aims to reconcile France with Les Halles by completely overhauling the station and mall, while adding a new stretch of gardens, a library, a new music and arts conservatory, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 a unique centre for hip-hop.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A worker looks at the building site of \u2018La Canop\u00e9e\u2019 (the canopy), a curvilinear building inspired by plant life and designed by French architects Jacques Anziutti and Patrick Berger. Photograph: Patrick Kovarik/AFP\nFor Hidalgo, the hip-hop centre is crucial. The highest number of users of Les Halles come from the banlieues, Paris\u2019s suburbs. Most are young people from France\u2019s diverse social mix, which is not always reflected in the centre of the capital. City hall wanted to include them, not push them away. Les Halles has always been a site of spontaneous hip-hop, particularly street dance in the station, so the space will have recording studios, dance studios and arts facilities that amateurs can walk in and use.\n\u201cEveryone who uses the suburban train lines, whether they live in Paris or not, should be able to come here and find a place to express themselves,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cThe idea is that for them, Les Halles will be a place of freedom away from the social constraints of the housing estates.\u201d\nArchitect Patrick Berger promised it would be a new \u201cgateway to the city\u201d and politely refused to comment on the errors of the past. \u201cFor an architect, constraints can become virtues,\u201d he said.\nThe project iscoming under heavy scrutiny. Some architects and urbanists initially argued that the best option would have been to leave street-level totally open as a vast green space.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Les Halles in 1969. Photograph: AFP\nAlbert L\u00e9vy, an architect and urbanist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, told the Guardian: \u201cIt seems to me like a megalomaniac project. Was there really the need to build a canopy this costly? It\u2019s debatable. There could have perhaps been something lighter, more discreet, less costly and more in the spirit of Baltard \u2013 whom Napoleon III had asked to create a covering for the market as light as an umbrella.\u201d\nDonato Severo, an architect and historian at Paris University, said the destruction of the 19th-century pavilions had been \u201cthe most violent act against Paris heritage ever committed\u201d. But the city, from that point on, had become extremely cautious about its architectural heritage. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to imagine that scale of destruction today,\u201d he said.\nHe felt the biggest challenge now was to create a fluidity to Les Halles, to make it easier to walk around and less bewildering.\n\u201cUltimately,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an attempt to heal a wound that never closed.\u201d", "date_time": "2016-02-01T10:09:56", "author": "Angelique Chrisafis", "lang": "en", "topic": "France|Paris|Architecture|Design|Europe|news", "category": "world|europe", "title": "Paris hopes \u20ac1bn revamp of Les Halles can become city's 'beating heart'", "source": "guardian", "intro": "French capital to unveil reworked site crowned with one of the most ambitious architectural projects of the decade"},

Then the team\u2019s owner hit upon a novel idea \u2013 a sponsorship deal with Libya\u2019s unyielding leader\nIn next year\u2019s NHL draft, the No1 pick won\u2019t be the prototypical teen from Ontario, the Swedish speedster, or pummeling Muscovite. It will be an 18-year-old from Arizona who plays in Switzerland named Auston Matthews. The young phenom has ended up playing in Europe thanks to a combination of outsider hockey status \u2013 Phoenix is not exactly a hockeyhot-bed \u2013 and the logistics of being born just after the cutoff for last year\u2019s draft.\nEurope has long been a haven for North American hockey players. But most players who end up there are looking to continue the dream of making a living playing the sport they love, even if the NHL isn\u2019t calling for them. That\u2019s how Dan Olsen and Bruce Hardy, two Canadians, ended up in Iserlohn, just south of Dortmund in Germany. It was there that, in 1987, their hockey careers would lead them into what amounted to a dystopian version of Slap Shot. Their bankrupt team, ECD Iserlohn, turned to the most unlikely of saviors: Muammar Gaddafi.\nFrom the Olympics to Euro 2016: how to attend the top sporting events Read more\nEuropean hockey is a strange place: jerseys are a neoliberal dream of sponsorship patches, and top scorers on each team are marked with gold helmets; there\u2019s a lot of gimmick and schtick that goes into making the sport financially viable as it competes with soccer for attention. Heinz Weifenbach, the owner of ECD Iserlohn, was perfect for this world. A gregarious, mustachioed, cigar-smoking bon vivant who made his fortune in real estate development, Weifenbach had poured his wealth into making Iserlohn one of Germany\u2019s top teams.\nDan Olsen remembers \u201cHeinzy\u201d as full of life, and a man who wasn\u2019t afraid to let the players know what he thought of their play.\n\u201cHe would come in the dressing room sometimes and if we weren\u2019t playing good, he\u2019d be swearing away in German \u2013 and one time he actually came in and pulled a gun out of his pants!\u201d\nAs wild as Weifenbach was, he had built a solid squad. Bruce Hardy describes him as \u201cone of the most amazing men you\u2019ll ever meet. He loved hockey, he loved Iserlohn, he made sure he took care of his players\u201d. The previous season, with Hardy on the team, they had made the league semi-finals. Things were promising for the new season with a new crop brought in including Olsen. But all was not well, as the club owed the German authorities $3.4m in taxes. With the club unable to pay, the players stopped practicing, and multiple coaches came and went.\nBruce Hardy\u2019s hockey shirt, complete with Green Book logo. Photograph: Gabriel Luis Manga for the Guardian\nPlayers had heard rumblings of tax troubles with the team in previous years, yet Weifenbach\u2019s tax accountant, known as \u201cMerlin the Magician\u201d, seemed to make the books work every season. Butthen the authorities had caught up to the team. Tax officials began showing up at the players\u2019 apartments early in the morning, demanding to see their contracts with the team, and the declarations of income they claimed they had sent to the players. The forms and contracts were nowhere to be found, having been \u201ctaken care of\u201d by Merlin.\nAs a penalty, players were fine a thousand marks each, and began seizing personal items of value to cover costs. \u201cThey took my TV, they took my leather coats, they took my football, my baseball glove, and they thought I had a gold coin, but what it was was the first year the loonie had come out in Canada\u201d, recalls Hardy. Olsen was luckier: new to the team, the authorities didn\u2019t know where he lived.\nNeeding to act quickly, Weifenbach dreamed up an idea with the mayor of a neighboring Iserlohn suburb to to save the team: fly to Libya and ask Muammar Gaddafi, Libya\u2019s tyrannical leader, to become the team\u2019s patron.\nGreeted in Libya by Gaddafi himself, Weifenbach conducted a series of negotiations. Eventually a deal was struck. Gaddafi would give Weifenbach $900,000 for the season to keep his club afloat. Predictably, there was a catch: in exchange for the money, the team must promote Gaddafi\u2019s Green Book \u2013 a collection of ramblings and political philosophies of the late dictator \u2013 on their jerseys.\nThis might appear to have come out of the blue, but Gaddafi was connected to sport. He paid Perugia and Sampdoria to carry his son Saadi Gaddafi on the roster, with owners pleading managers to allow the younger Gaddafi on the pitch in hopes of gaining more cash from the family.\nMuammar Gaddafi\u2019s connections to Germany were not new, either. Hardy remembers ads for the Green Book appearing on local taxi cabs even before their hockey team\u2019s relationship with the Libyans, and Libyan oil was still being readily imported into Germany.\nBut Gaddafi was a controversial and menacing figure. In 1986, two years before the Lockerbie bombing, La Belle discotheque in Berlin had been bombed. The US pointed to Gaddafi as the culprit, claiming he targeted a nightclub where numerous US soldiers were spending the evening. Transcriptions were intercepted from the Libyan embassy in East Germany, and Reagan would go on to bomb Tripoli in response.\nFor Hardy, Olsen, and the rest of the team, however, Gaddafi\u2019s investment brought a sense of relief. They were there to play hockey, wanted to see the team stay together, and were unaware or uninterested in the politics. It wasn\u2019t until the morning before the first game that Hardy would start to realize the situation at hand. Called into the team office after the morning skate, he was told he had a phone call. \u201cThis is Tom Brokaw from New York,\u201d said the voice at the other end. Media across the world had picked up on the story. \u201cOK, now this is big time,\u201d thought Hardy.\nBy the time the Hardy and Olsen returned to the rink for the game that night fans had been whipped into a frenzy. \u201cIt was packed. It was a zoo. It was the most amazing atmosphere I\u2019ve ever seen in my life\u201d, says Hardy.\nSpurred on by the frenetic support, the team would win their first game under the patronage of Gaddafi, complete with Das Grune Buch emblazoned across their chests. \u201cWe sat in the dressing room looking at each other, thinking \u2018what just happened?\u2019\u201c\nThe media and German ice hockey federation, on the other hand, were not amused. Der Spiegel declared Weifenbach\u2019s hockey fiefdom as \u201cSodom and Gomorrah\u201d, and interior minister Friedrich Zimmermann said: \u201cWhat at first looked like a carnival joke is a flagrant violation of political neutrality of the sport\u201d.\nGerman national team coach Xavier Unsinn, no fan of Weifenbach for his perceived over reliance on foreign players, would criticize the team further by saying sport should not be associated with criminals and terrorism.\nThe following week, an away game in Frankfurt, the team was met not with desert-robed fans cheering, but instead protesters and riot police at the charged arena.\n\u201cNow we start getting threats \u2026 that there\u2019s no guarantee on our lives. \u2018You wear those sweaters and you\u2019re in trouble,\u2019\u201d remembers Hardy.\nThe players, now realizing the magnitude of the situation, decided to take a vote. They could wear the Green Book jerseys and continue to be paid, risking further media scrutiny and possible harm, or play the game in their old sweaters sans Gaddafi and risk their team\u2019s financial collapse. The players voted to play in their old sweaters.\nWeifenbach entered the locker room and was told of the results of the impromptu player vote. He told the team he respected their decision and that as such this would be the last game for the team, with the club unable to operate without the money from the sponsorship.\nEven without the vote the team would likely still have been doomed. Despite Weifenbach\u2019s claims of the neutrality of the green book and sponsorship the German hockey federation would ban the team from featuring it on their jerseys.\nIt\u2019s a moment that both players will never forget, but are rarely asked about. Olsen now coaches back in his native Calgary at the South Alberta Institute of Technology, and it wasn\u2019t until Gaddafi\u2019s fall in 2011 that people around him would even know of his connection.\n\u201cThe president, at work, he googled Iserlohn, and the Muammar Gaddafi stuff came up. He asked, and I sat in his office talking about it, and he was in disbelief!\u201d\nHardy is back in Alberta as well after playing over a decade in Germany, and still has his Green Book patched Iserlohn sweater. Weifenbach and the club would eventually return to the league, albeit minus Gaddafi.\nSports fans continue to grapple with the marriage of money, politics, and the games we love \u2013 just look at the Fifa corruption scandal. Weifenbach and ECD Iserlohn serve as a tale of a man who took sport and money to its ideological limits.

A passer-by was killed when the attackers detonated their explosive vests but the casualties could have been far worse if any of the three suicide bombers had managed to get inside the stadium.\nSecurity at the Stade de France had already been strengthened following the attacks in Paris in January 2015, and it is being increased further. The clampdown will begin when bomb disposal teams sweep the stadium and its environs on Friday; the police presence will be more than doubled for the tournament\u2019s opening game.\nThe man in charge of the Stade de France operation is Robert Broussard. In the early 1970s he was one of the leading figures in the Brigade de Recherche et d\u2019Intervention, the elite police unit who are in the vanguard of the fight against terrorism.\nBroussard, who is 79, has been in charge of stadium security for the French Rugby Federation for the past five years. He faces a challenging couple of months. The match against Italy is followed by Ireland the following weekend and the visit of England on the final day of the tournament on 19 March.\n\u201cOur objective is that people will come feeling confident,\u201d he told the Journal du Dimanche, advising those with tickets to arrive in plenty of time to pass through the security checks.\nPast rugby internationals at the Stade de France have been overseen by 100 police and 700 security staff and stewards. This Saturday there will be 250 police and 900 security staff, perhaps more if the president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and the prime minister, Manuel Valls, attend.\nHollande was in the Stade de France on 13 November and his presence on Saturday would be highly symbolic. It would also add to the pressure on Broussard but, as befits a former commissioner of police, he is exuding calm confidence. \u201cWe want the match to take place in the best conditions and with the same spirit of warmth that one always finds at rugby games, \u201c he told Midi Olympique on Monday. \u201cOne must above all not panic people. So we are confident, calm but also very vigilant.\u201d\nWhile Broussard is in charge of security inside the stadium, outside is the domain of the police. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved from a system geared to controlling crowds and hooliganism to a system aimed at stopping terrorist attacks,\u201d said Laurent Simonin, the police chief responsible for securing the area outside the Stade de France.\nThe three rugby internationals will provide the police with invaluable experience before the Euro 2016 football championship when tens of thousands of supporters from across the continent will descend on France. On Saturday they will cordon off the immediate approach to the stadium with seven lines of staggered barriers where security staff will search spectators and their bags. There will then be a second search at the turnstiles before fans can enter the stadium and take their seats.\nBroussard, a lifelong rugby supporter, has written to the Italian Rugby Federation to make them and the Italian fans who will be among the expected 60,000 crowd aware of the security measures.

The Netherlands took on the role at the start of 2016.\nWhen asked what the 12 gold stars on the EU flag represented, nearly three-quarters of MPs incorrectly chose \u201cThe 12 nations in the European community when the flag was designed\u201d. Just 7% knew it was a reference to the number 12 being a symbol of perfection, completeness and unity.\nHalf of the parliamentarians surveyed said they would vote to remain in the EU, while 11% wanted the UK\u2019s exit. The remaining third said they were waiting for the outcome of David Cameron\u2019s renegotiations before making a decision either way.\nThe bulk of those waiting to see what deal the prime minister reaches are Conservative MPs.

Both sides hope to reach agreement next week\nWhat are Britain\u2019s negotiations with the EU all about?\nIn 2013, David Cameron promised an in-out referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership before the end of 2017 if the Conservatives won the general election. He is expected to lead the campaign to stay in the EU if he can secure a renegotiation of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU that he is happy with.\nSince the party\u2019s election victory in May, talks between the UK and the rest of the EU have been gathering pace and have now reached a crucial moment. Both sides hope to strike a deal on 18-19 February at a summit of EU leaders.\nCameron has said he wants the UK to remain in a \u201creformed EU\u201d. Speaking this month on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show, he said a British exit was not \u201cthe right answer\u201d, but promised that in the event of a vote to leave he would do \u201ceverything necessary to make it work\u201d.\nWhat does Cameron want?\nHe is seeking changes in four areas: limiting in-work benefits for EU citizens working in Britain, stronger protection for countries outside the eurozone, a target to cut EU red tape, and more power for national parliaments to stop unwanted EU laws.\nWhat is the main sticking point?\nThe most controversial part of the talks is Cameron\u2019s wish to restrict other EU citizens working in Britain from claiming in-work benefits for four years. For the rest of the EU, this amounts to discrimination that flouts the basic principle of freedom of movement. To bridge the differences, the European commission has proposed an emergency brake to stop migration flows if and when welfare systems and public services are under serious strain.\nDowning Street has claimed a \u201csignificant breakthrough\u201d in the talks because the commission has accepted that current numbers of EU workers in the UK mean the emergency brake could be triggered. But Eurosceptics are rubbishing the emergency brake, because officials in Brussels rather than the British government would decide when to use it.\nEU renegotiation talks reach 'crucial' climax - Politics live Read more\nSo everything else is agreed?\nThe benefits issue has grabbed the headlines, but the UK\u2019s ideas for protecting the rights of non-eurozone countries are also proving contentious. This agenda has been shaped by George Osborne, with the aim of protecting the City of London. He wants to reset the balance of power between the 19 countries sharing the euro and the minority outside the single currency.\nIn practice, this means official recognition that the EU has more than one currency and a get-out clause on economic policy, confusingly also known as an emergency brake. Countries outside the eurozone could use the economic emergency brake to stop unwanted economic laws, triggering further discussions among EU leaders. But this would require treaty change and several eurozone countries, including France and Germany, are loath to introduce this mechanism when the currency union may need to act fast in a debt crisis. France is insisting that it will not give the British veto powers over the eurozone.\nThe rest is easy?\nThe determination of the Conservative party to rewrite the EU\u2019s \u201cever closer union\u201d motto perplexes other European governments. To allay Eurosceptic fears, EU leaders in 2014 drafted a declaration that \u201cever closer union\u201d allows for different paths of integration \u2026respecting the wish of those who do not want to deepen any further\u201d. France and Germany are reluctant to go beyond this, but some face-saving formula is expected.\nAgreement is also possible on Cameron\u2019s plan to give national parliaments power to block EU legislation, as few governments see it as a game-changer.\nWasn\u2019t there something about so-called red tape?\nThe final area of negotiations concerns competitiveness and is the least contentious. The European commission has already published plans aimed at simplifying EU regulation, which go some way to meeting Cameron\u2019s demands. All EU countries are ready to sign up to \u201ccompetitiveness and better regulation\u201d, the most widely used EU buzz words, although governments have very different ideas about what this means in practice. In the short term, these differences can be papered over and are unlikely to stand in the way of a deal.\nWhat happens now?\nMore talking. Senior officials are meeting on Monday to discuss possible compromises on the British demands. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, is expected to send a draft agreement to all 28 EU member states on Tuesday. The rest of the EU will have a chance to give its response on Friday at talks between senior officials, paving the way for EU leaders to meet in Brussels next week.\nWhat if there is no deal next week?\nCameron is trying to sound relaxed about failure to reach a deal next week: his aim, he said recently, is to hold the referendum before the end of 2017. The prospect of a second EU leaders\u2019 summit in February to nail down a deal has already been mooted. But senior EU officials are wary about the British talks dominating the EU\u2019s agenda while the union struggles to cope with the refugee crisis.\nSo when is the referendum?\nA deal between the UK and the rest of the EU in February would fire the starting gun on the formal referendum campaign. At least 16 weeks is needed to prepare for polling day and the government has pencilled in 23 June. Any delay in reaching agreement would mean holding the referendum in September. This is seen as more risky for the pro-EU cause, as it is likely to coincide with a peak in refugee arrivals, potentially strengthening the leave vote.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T14:14:12", "author": "Jennifer Rankin", "lang": "en", "topic": "Brexit|European Union|David Cameron|Europe|Eurozone|European commission|news", "category": "politics", "title": "Cameron\u2019s EU deal negotiations: the key questions answered", "source": "guardian", "intro": "PM wants changes in four areas \u2013 with limiting in-work benefits for EU citizens the main sticking point.

It is understood that a mechanism proposed by Juncker, which would be set out in the Tusk letter, says that the current levels of migration to the UK would justify the application of the brake.\nBut Downing Street says the emergency brake would have to be as effective as the prime minister\u2019s original proposal of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits.\nSteve Baker, the Tory MP for Wycombe, who is a leading member of the Vote Leave group, has described the brake as a sick joke amid claims that it would be lifted after four years. The prime minister is understood to be pressing for restrictions on benefits to be applied for seven years.\nCameron\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cThe discussions are ongoing. The prime minister is making very clear that, as he has said throughout, any alternative to four years has to be equally as effective.\u201d\nDowning Street played down speculation that 60% of the prime minister\u2019s demands in his EU negotiations had been met. But progress has been made on his call for a new initiative to boost EU competitiveness, for Britain to be given an opt-out from the EU\u2019s historic commitment to create an \u201cever closer union\u201d and for national parliaments to be allowed to club together to block EU legislation.\nDeal or no deal? Cameron bid to reform EU hits fresh obstacles Read more\nNo 10 indicated that more work was needed on George Osborne\u2019s demands for non-eurozone countries to be given protections from rules drawn up for the single market.\nDowning Street says the UK was looking for a watertight \u201cenforcement mechanism\u201d, though not a veto, to allow non-eurozone members to flag up concerns. This could involve contentious legislation being referred to EU leaders on the European council. France is nervous because no member state has a veto over the rules of the single market while each EU leader has a veto on the European council.\nMore work was also needed to stop non-EU citizens getting access to Britain through \u201csham marriages\u201d. Non-EU citizens who marry a UK citizen have no automatic right to settle in the UK. But if they marry a citizen of another EU country they can move to the UK under the EU\u2019s rules on free movement.\nThe prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have been clear throughout that this isn\u2019t about the UK being able to veto further eurozone integration. It is about having clear principles and a way to enforce them.\u201d\nThe prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cOn the issue of sham marriages this is to do with abuse of free movement rights. It is about third-country nationals that then may find ways to use EU free movement rights to exploit loopholes.

Left to speak for himself, Caine\u2019s self-deprecating humour always shines through, as do his enjoyably chaotic political thoughts.\nOn this occasion he said he hadn\u2019t made up his mind about the coming referendum and that a Brexit vote would be \u201cscary\u201d.

Too many voters may reach the same half-baked conclusion.\nToday\u2019s reports that Donald Tusk, the European council president, left his No 10 dinner early last night should come as no surprise.

Clever metropolitan Tories and their pundit allies tend to talk that way. It\u2019ll be all right on the night.\nI\u2019m not so sure.

Photograph: Toby Melville/PA\nThe Times columnist and global-warming critic Matt Ridley (the George Monbiot of the right \u2013 clever and well informed, sceptical, all in the opposite direction), explains here (paywall) that the Leave.EU campaign, funded by the mouthy City money man Aaron Banks, with Nigel Farage on board, is the core no vote, anti-immigrant camp. The more mainstream Vote Leave, run by Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, will probably be designated the official no voice and concentrate on assuring the wavering third of voters, the ones who will decide the outcome, that their jobs and their kids\u2019 prospects will be safer. Caine is their kind of target voter.\nNay, the kids\u2019 prospects will be enhanced as Britain, cut free from the EU ball and chain, becomes \u201cthe Japan of the west, only more open\u201d, Ridley writes. An odd vision, given Japan\u2019s 20 years of frantic deflation. But Ridley, the chairman of Northern Rock when it crashed, is an optimist.

Or, to be more accurate, Sweden as they imagine it to be.\nMasked men in Stockholm threaten to 'punish' refugee children Read more\nTragically, these are images the world is accustomed to seeing. But not from Sweden, a country with a global reputation for egalitarianism, the recognition of human rights and support for international justice. With the restriction on the intake of refugees in late 2015, the announcement that up to 80,000 asylum seekers could be returned to their countries of origin, and now the threat of street violence, the image of the country as a bastion of tolerance and progressive politics has been ruined. It\u2019s unclear whether it can ever recover.\nWhen huge numbers of refugees and migrants braved the Mediterranean in search of a better life last year, Sweden took in nearly 200,000 of them. For a nation of 10 million this intake was massive, shaming many larger EU countries that claimed they were not able to help. This magnanimity was held up as a glowing example of the best of Swedish social democracy. While other countries made excuses and procrastinated, Sweden put its money where its mouth was.\nAnd this wasn\u2019t the first time. After Iraq was bombed into the ground a decade ago, Sweden took in huge numbers of Iraqi refugees while the US accepted just a trickle from the country it had destroyed. After the US supported the overthrow of the democratically elected Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973, leading to the brutal Augusto Pinochet regime, it was Sweden that accepted political refugees from that country. The list goes on.\nThe memory of this history \u2013 and the feel-good afterglow of Sweden\u2019s recent humanitarian efforts with the Syrian refugees \u2013 has quickly evaporated, replaced by the image of a country no different from its European fellows. That may not be entirely fair (Sweden is still one of the largest per capita foreign aid providers in the world), but \u2013 as with many countries \u2013 much of Sweden\u2019s image is a mixture of facts, half-truths and mythology.\nSweden and Denmark are not all warm welcomes and cuddly politics | Andrew Brown Read more\nWhen the far-right, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats first entered parliament in 2010 with 5.7% of the vote, many described them as nothing more than a one-issue \u201cprotest party\u201d.

The thought that there would be just five percentage points between the two parties would once have seemed ridiculous.\nThis is an existential social and political crisis for Sweden.

Violier had retained his three stars when the latest Swiss edition of the guide was announced in November.\nBefore the ceremony started on Monday, those gathered stood for a minute\u2019s silence in honour of Violier, but there were echoes of the earlier tragedy when it was revealed that Loiseau\u2019s restaurant, run by his wife Dominique since his death 13 years ago, had lost one of its three stars.\nVeyrat, who sold one of his establishments, the three-star Auberge de l\u2019Eridan in Annecy, \u201cfor health reasons\u201d and whose restaurant, La Maison du Bois in the French Alps, burned down last March, said he did not blame influential guides such as Michelin for the pressure, suggesting much of it was self-imposed.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Beno\u00eet Violier was found dead at his home on Sunday.

I gave up the evaluations and gave back my stars when I opened my last restaurant, but when it reopens I want to go chasing stars again.

We chefs are passionate madmen, mad with happiness.\u201d\nViolier, the son of a wine grower from the Charente-Maritime departement in south-west France, joined the kitchen team at the Crissier restaurant in 1996. A year later, the chef Philippe Rochat took over the restaurant and in 1998 was awarded three Michelin stars.\nRochat retired in 2012. Violier and his wife then took over running the restaurant. The two men were close; Violier regarded Rochat as his mentor and a second father. He was doubly devastated when his father died in April last year, and Rochat, 61, died three months later after falling ill while out cycling.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a curse,\u201d Veyrat said of the Crissier. \u201cCan it survive this new drama?

The Gault et Millau guide, whose opinion is considered second only to the Michelin in the world of haute cuisine, had just downgraded his establishment from 19/20 to 17, and there were strong rumours that Michelin would follow suit.\nHe had made it clear how high he felt the stakes were.

(It demoted Loiseau\u2019s restaurant, run since his death by his wife, to two stars.)\nBut the constant, nagging fear of the fall from grace that might one day come, and resentment at the tyranny of a system that, many chefs feel, toys with hard-won reputations for reasons that all too often seem unclear or even arbitrary, can have a terrible psychological effect.\nWe\u2019re on a razor\u2019s edge the whole time, because what we do is a combination of art and business Three-star chef Pierre Gagnaire\n\u201cThey tell you you\u2019re one of the very best then, overnight, they tell you you\u2019re not,\u201d said Guy Martin, of the three-star Grand Vefour in Paris, following Loiseau\u2019s suicide. \u201cWhy?

Gerard Besson had a heart attack \u2013 which he survived \u2013 in 2003 on hearing he had suffered the same fate.\nAs far back as 1671, the celebrated cuisinier Francois Vatel ran himself through with his sword after a delivery of fish failed to arrive on time for the banquet he was preparing for Louis XIV and 2,000 guests at the Chateau de Chantilly.\nBut there is evidence that today\u2019s chefs \u2013 who must often be top-flight, profit-making businessmen as well as culinary artists \u2013 are under particular strain. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t often see,\u201d the three-star chef Pierre Gagnaire, whose first Michelin-starred restaurant went bankrupt, said some years ago, \u201cis that behind the facade of this profession [there] is suffering and downright exhaustion. We\u2019re on a razor\u2019s edge the whole time, because what we do is a combination of art and business.\u201d\nOne Michelin star more (or less) is thought, in France, to be worth up to 25% of a restaurant\u2019s turnover. But the strictures of the guide \u2013 sometimes seen as rewarding the frills more than the food, forcing restaurants to invest astronomical sums on decor, tableware and staff \u2013 impose their own pressures.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Skye Gyngell found her Michelin star a curse and removed it from her website.

Some of the victims have jointly filed a single complaint, so that the number of alleged crimes stands at more than 750, of which more than 380 are sexual offences, including at least three rapes.\nCologne police are investigating 43 suspects in connection with the incidents, the majority of whom are Moroccan or Algerian.

Good progress last 24 hours but still outstanding issues.\u201d\nCameron is expected to brief the cabinet on Tuesday morning on the state of his negotiations with Tusk, who hopes to reach a deal at the next European council meeting on 18-19 February.\nA failure to reach agreement could lead Tusk to convene a second, extra, summit by the first week of March to allow Cameron to hold an in/out referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership on his preferred date of 23 June.\nDowning Street is likely to give a detailed response to Tusk\u2019s statement on Tuesday, which is likely to be highly detailed and will explain any legislative changes that are needed. Cameron will speak out if he believes that Tusk has failed to meet his demands in the most contentious areas of welfare reforms and protections for non-eurozone members.\nCameron will then embark on a tour of EU capitals over the next two weeks to persuade EU leaders to back his demands or risk forcing the UK out of the EU.\nDowning Street said earlier that good progress had been made in the negotiations. The prime minister was encouraged when Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, agreed at a meeting in Brussels on Friday that an emergency brake to limit benefit payments to EU migrants could be imposed as soon as a referendum is passed.\nIt is understood that a mechanism proposed by Juncker, which would be set out in the Tusk letter, says current levels of migration to the UK would justify the application of the brake.\nBut Downing Street says the emergency brake would have to be as effective as the prime minister\u2019s original proposal of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits.\nSteve Baker, the Tory MP for Wycombe, who is a leading member of the Vote Leave group, has described the brake as a \u201cjoke\u201d amid claims that it would be lifted after four years. The prime minister is understood to be pressing for restrictions on benefits to be applied for seven years.\nNo 10 indicated that more work was needed on Osborne\u2019s demands for non-eurozone countries to be given protections from rules drawn up for the single market.\nDowning Street said the UK was looking for a watertight \u201cenforcement mechanism\u201d, though not a veto, to allow non-eurozone members to flag up concerns. This could involve contentious legislation being referred to EU leaders on the European council. France is nervous because no member state has a veto over the rules of the single market, while each EU leader has a veto on the European council.\nMore work was also needed to stop non-EU citizens getting access to Britain through \u201csham marriages\u201d. Non-EU citizens who marry a UK citizen have no automatic right to settle in the UK. But if they marry a citizen of another EU country they can move to the UK under the EU\u2019s rules on free movement.\nWelcoming progress in the talks over the weekend, No 10 denied that Cameron was staging a confrontation with EU leaders before delivering a deal at a summit later this month.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t accept that at all,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman said in response to criticisms from the Vote Leave and Leave.EU campaign groups. \u201cLook at the amount of hard work, time and effort that the prime minister, other senior ministers and indeed senior government officials have put into this and into making progress.

Meanwhile, its \u00a318,600 minimum income rule is casting families into misery and destitution and potential loss of life. At a time when David Cameron has pronounced on his determination to strengthen and support UK families, the Home Office is destroying families. Given that, like so many others who have achieved asylum and citizenship, Mr Aziz and Mr Sharif had to subsist in the UK on poverty wages and insecure employment which would never have allowed them to achieve visas for their wives and children, their situations are beyond repair.

At present statistics show that the 10 areas with the highest ratio of asylum seekers per 1,000 population are all in northern England, Wales or Scotland. Most of these are also places with relatively high levels of deprivation and unemployment.

{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/europes-refugee-story-has-hardly-begun-greece", "content": "The refugee story has hardly begun. There will be, on conservative estimates, another million arriving via Turkey this year \u2013 and maybe more. The distribution quotas proposed by Germany, and resisted by many states in eastern Europe, are already a fiction and will fade into insignificance as the next wave comes.\nGermany itself will face critical choices: if you\u2019re suddenly running a budget deficit to meet the needs of asylum seekers, how do you justify not spending on the infrastructure that\u2019s supposed to serve German citizens, which has crumbled through underinvestment in the Angela Merkel era?\nBut these problems are sideshows compared with the big, existential issues that a second summer of uncontrolled migration into Greece would bring.\nFirst, there\u2019s the diplomatic onslaught on Greece. Last week the European Commission mulled quarantining Greece by building a razor-wire fence inside the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which is not even a member of the EU. German sources floated the idea of cancelling Greece\u2019s debt if only Greece would agree to jail 400,000 migrants. A Belgian minister, in an EU negotiation, is alleged \u2013 by his Greek counterpart \u2013 to have demanded the Greeks \u201cpush back or sink\u201d the boats coming from Turkey, in breach of international law. Others in Europe are proposing to criminalise the NGOs that are helping the refugees as they arrive in the islands.\nIf any of these things happen, they are likely to tear Greek civil society apart. Long before that, these demands are demonstrating to the rest of Europe the incapacity of its leading powers and institutions to face facts: the next million refugees could only be stopped by a policy of pushback that would break all humanitarian law.\nProblem number two is the moral implosion of the Turkish government. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s army has already turned the Kurdish regions of southern Turkey into a war zone. Now he is pushing for life imprisonment for two prominent journalists from the secularist newspaper Cumhuriyet, for an investigation that claimed to show proof that his government was sending arms to IS. This is not some maverick judge at work \u2013 the demand for a 30-year sentence was brought by Erdo\u011fan himself: head of state of a country that still thinks it could join Europe and that retains its Nato membership, with no discouragement so far from Brussels.\nThe third problem is the paralysis of the EU institutions. Germany unilaterally suspended the Dublin treaty, which would have forced migrants to return to Greece to be processed. Most eastern-European countries have rejected Germany\u2019s proposed redistribution mechanism, preferring a system regulated by jagged pieces of metal and police wearing surgical masks. Schengen is close to being a dead letter.\nUnlike the Greek debt crisis \u2013 where \u201cextend and pretend\u201d has been the watchword \u2013 this indecision, illusion and failure to confront facts is urgent.\nGreece is not going to \u201cpush back or sink\u201d inflatables containing refugees. However many compromises Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government made over austerity, it is full of human rights lawyers, criminology professors and people who spent their lives fighting fascism. There is outrage at Europe\u2019s demands inside the Greek political establishment, ranging well beyond the radical-left party Syriza and its small nationalist coalition partner.\nEastern Europe is, by and large, going to let the refugees go to hell. There is very little compassion in the media coverage of the refugees east of the former Iron Curtain. Poland, Hungary and Slovakia have swung towards populist nationalism. While there are tens of millions of liberal-minded, largely young people who are prepared to show compassion and adhere to international obligations, they do not control east Europe\u2019s governments.\nAs for Turkey, it has, to date, taken no visibly stronger measures to keep Syrian refugees inside its own borders and prevent the deadly traffic across the sea to Greece. For a state that can arrest its own newspaper editors at will and bomb its own cities, that demonstrates a clear set of priorities.\nSo there are only two variables: what the EU does next and what the European peoples do.\nIf Germany has given up trying to organise the orderly distribution of refugees inside the EU, then free movement itself is on borrowed time. Everybody understands this, except the political and media classes who have to maintain the fiction that everything is fine. Germany had, by December, registered just over half the 900,000 asylum claims it is facing. The hard-right AfD party has sprung from sixth to third in the polls. Angela Merkel seems frozen in the headlights of the oncoming train.\nWhich leaves the people. Quietly, and without rhetoric, one of the most spectacular, cross-border solidarity movements ever formed has emerged to help the refugees. Churches, NGOs, communities, police forces and social services \u2013 plus ordinary people with no big agenda \u2013 just got on and saved people, moved them along, gave them water, food and clothing, and are right now helping them to settle in.\nAgainst that, of course, there are people such as the young British men who gave the fascist salute, unmasked, to the TV cameras, during the fracas at Dover this weekend.\nOur grandfathers smashed fascism \u2013 outlawed it, executed its leaders, suppressed its ideas \u2013 because they knew how seductive that stiff-armed salute can be to idiots with a grievance, once all the illusions start to burn. They squeezed Germany dry of geopolitical power because they knew it had a tendency to be wielded unwisely, even by democrats. They thanked their lucky stars that eastern Europe was somebody else\u2019s problem. And they deployed an army to ensure Greece stayed pro-western and democratic.\nIn this, the generation of Churchill and Attlee showed greater strategic vision than the current one. David Cameron\u2019s obsession with negotiating a fig-leaf concession on migrant in-work benefits from Europe seems, when set against the scale of the historic challenge, small. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s trip to Calais did not even ask the roaring questions: what should Germany do; what should the Commission do; what should the UK Border Force do? By reverting to gestures, British politicians are already signalling strategic disengagement with Europe\u2019s migration crisis, which itself is feeding in to the negative popular perception of the EU.\nThere is a rising concern in British political circles that the next million refugees might tip the UK electorate into voting for Brexit. I suspect that\u2019s too simple. The biggest threat to British consent for EU membership would be if the European Commission tries to force Greece to drown migrants, and then turns it into a quarantined prison camp when it refuses. People would rightly ask in whose name that was being done.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T18:45:22", "author": "Paul Mason", "lang": "en", "topic": "Refugees|Opinion|Migration|Greece|Europe|Turkey|Syria|comment", "category": "opinion", "title": "Europe\u2019s refugee story has hardly begun", "source": "guardian", "intro": "With a million new refugees expected in Europe this year, Greece faces a diplomatic onslaught and an existential crisis"},

The birds, he said, are in many cases demonstrating that they have superior onboard equipment to the drones.\nClose encounters of the drone kind: near-collisions with UAVs increasing Read more\n\u201cWhat I find fascinating is that birds can hit the drone in such a way that they don\u2019t get injured by the rotors,\u201d said LeBaron. \u201cThey seem to be whacking the drone right in the centre so they don\u2019t get hit; they have incredible visual acuity and they can probably actually see the rotors.\u201d\nHumans, of course, only see rotors as a blur \u2013 LeBaron suspects that the eagles can make out the complete movement and thus have no trouble avoiding injury. It doesn\u2019t hurt, either, that attacking a drone the way a bird might attack another bird is usually effective. \u201cTheir method of attack is always going to be to hit it in the middle of the back; with the drones they perceive the rotors on the side and so they just go for the rear.\u201d\nThe birds Guard From Above is using \u2013 in the video above, a pair of bald eagles, one immature and one adult \u2013 appear trained not merely to disable the drone, but to retrieve it, an even trickier feat.\nUsing birds to take down drones is that latest in a series of attempts to tackle unwanted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

Dozens of contracts running into billions of dollars were discussed. He met the pope, the Italian prime minister, the French president, and many business leaders.\nThe security services continue to harass and detain activists, writers and journalists\nAfter years of tensions and mistrust, the scenes of a smiling Iranian leader being welcomed with open arms in European capitals were in stark contrast with the recent past. Yet in spite of the feelgood imagery, to believe that Iran\u2019s regime has altogether transformed itself and might now be moving towards decisive domestic reform and a constructive role on the international stage would be naive and shortsighted.\nIran may have a president with a \u201cmoderate\u201d profile \u2013 one whose smooth approach comes as a relief after the Ahmadinejad years \u2013 but that does not mean the authoritarian nature of the regime or the objectives of its foreign policy have changed. Iran still ranks as one of the most repressive states in the world, and there has been no improvement.\nIran releases Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian in prisoner swap with US Read more\nThe government was probably looking for a public relations bonus in the west when it recently released a number of journalists, but the statistics tell another story: in 2015 Iran executed at least 830 people, including juveniles, many for non-violent crimes. The security services continue to harass and detain activists, writers and journalists. The methods used by the regime to crush the pro-democracy Green movement in 2009 are still very much in use today.\nNor has Iran become in any way more \u201cmoderate\u201d in its behaviour in the Middle East. In Syria, Iran\u2019s militias and Republican Guards are direct participants in the war crimes that the Assad regime inflicts on its own population. Iran\u2019s close ally Hezbollah played a key role in the siege of Madaya, where children died of hunger as a result, and it is part of similar operations elsewhere.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anti-Rouhani protest in Paris, 28 January 2016. Photograph: Zacharie Scheurer/AP\nIt is to be hoped that a sustained implementation of the nuclear agreement will improve international security. But to draw from that the notion that Iran must now be spared any reproach would be foolish. Iran\u2019s hardliners sought economic relief through the nuclear deal because they desperately want to keep their hold on power, not because they want to pursue a more democratic path at home or more rational policies abroad. Diplomacy is important, but it must not come at the expense of clearsightedness, nor should it be accompanied by the kind of simplistic analysis that puts the sole onus on Saudi Arabia rather than on Iran as far as human rights are concerned. The records of both countries are equally dismal.\nIn the reporting of President Rouhani\u2019s visit, the covering up of nude statues in Rome, supposedly to spare the Iranian delegation a sight they would find objectionable, was treated as a sort of comic interlude. But it is hardly a laughing matter that, while its president was on a charm offensive in Europe, Iran\u2019s military forces were carrying on their brutal operations in Syria as usual.

{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/feb/01/ofcom-chief-writing-ft-three-o2-merger", "content": "It is a poor show that Sharon White, head of the communications regulator Ofcom, is reduced to writing columns in the FT to try to block Three\u2019s takeover of O2. The blame lies with European legislation, which dictates that Brussels decides on deals between companies whose parents have big operations in more than one EU country, as both Three and O2 do.\nStill, at least White is doing her best to crank up the pressure on the EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager. White signalled her opposition to the \u00a310bn deal in a speech last October and now she has slammed her cards on the table. She is right to do so: a combination of Three and O2, creating a new market leader and reducing the number of UK networks from four to three, would damage competition and leave consumers poorer.\nAh, the network operators always plead in these circumstances, the investment demands in the telecoms industry are so heavy that they can only be undertaken by big companies that can write large cheques.\nWhite examined this argument and found no supporting evidence. Mobile companies have maintained healthy cashflow margins above 12% in the UK even while rolling out 4G technology. \u201cCompetition, not consolidation, has driven investment,\u201d as she puts it.\nWhat\u2019s more, fewer competitors usually means higher prices for customers. In Austria, which underwent a similar four-to-three consolidation, mobile prices have risen 15%, with light users \u2013 often the young and the old \u2013 suffering steeper increases. The Austrian experiment is one the UK would happily live without, especially as Three, with its all-you-can-eat data packages, has demonstrably added to biodiversity in the UK telecoms jungle.\nVestager, thankfully, may be sympathetic to White\u2019s views. She threw so many obstacles in front of a four-to-three consolidation in her homeland of Denmark that the proposed deal collapsed.\nBut there are still reasons to worry. First, Denmark may be the exception: four-to-three consolidation has also been allowed in Germany and Ireland. Second, Ofcom is concerned that the European telecoms framework leaves national regulators under-equipped to deal with emerging oligopolies. White, in that same speech last October, joined European counterparts in pleading for \u201cthe full range of tools to do the job\u201d \u2013 a cry as yet unanswered.\nIf Three/02 is allowed to happen it would be a slap in the face for Ofcom and a severe blow to the credibility of UK telecoms regulation. No wonder White is deploying unorthodox tactics instead of relying on backroom chats in Brussels. The sooner Vestager says no to Three/02 the better.\nBreaking up might be hard to do at BT\nBT has no such worries on the mobile front. Its purchase of EE was completed last week and, by way of celebration, BT\u2019s shares closed within pennies of 500p on Monday, boosted also by a strong set of third-quarter numbers. It would have been the highest price for the shares since those gung-ho dotcom days of 2001, just before BT\u2019s last adventure in mobile ended with the sale of Cellnet to reduce debt.\nIn the circumstances, BT can\u2019t be surprised that it is regarded in some quarters as recreating a hideous monopoly. Break it up, comes the cry, and Grant Shapps, former Tory party chairman, has persuaded 120 MPs to support forced separation of Openreach, the bit of BT that owns and manages the copper-and-fibre networks.\nLiberating Openreach is one decision Ofcom can make (it will opine later this month) but the Shapps lobby should be careful what it wishes for. An independent Openreach would still be a dominant supplier of wholesale broadband connections and its economic incentives to invest in better infrastructure would not increase one jot on day one. Indeed, an independent Openreach, which would presumably be burdened with a proportionate share of BT\u2019s pension liabilities, might try to milk profits over time.\nBest to leave Openreach within BT and do two things. Hit it with fines that properly hurt if service standards don\u2019t improve. And find ways to promote real competition. Sky and TalkTalk are conducting trials of an ultrafast broadband network in York.

Nostalgia dictates that things were always so much better in the olden days when we had certainty.\nIt\u2019s all right \u2013 you can relax. I have no intention of boring you senseless with syrupy sentiment. I\u2019m confident I missed journalism\u2019s golden age \u2013 if there was in fact a golden age. But I do want to start with a personal counterpoint because it helps me sift through how things have changed in the 20 years I\u2019ve been hacking away in the parliamentary press gallery in Canberra.\nIn January 1996 I showed up at the Senate entrance of Parliament House waiting to be signed in by my new colleagues at the Australian Financial Review. I was then in my mid 20s. I\u2019d had an accidental first career thrust upon me by the recession in the early 1990s \u2013 I\u2019d been a public servant since my exit from university because I\u2019d been lucky enough to have been taken on as a graduate administrative assistant at a time when it was very hard to get a job.\nBetween 1992 and 1996 (with a year off wandering the world) I worked in three government departments \u2013 industrial relations, the environment, and communications and the arts. As a consequence, I knew about policy \u2013 how proposals tracked up through departments and over to Parliament House and back again. I\u2019d been a very junior sausage maker, attached to some very experienced and connected bosses. And as a consequence of the sort of work I did, I knew ministerial staff, a number of bureaucrats and some press gallery folks. That was my value to the AFR: knowing something of the working of government from the inside.\nThese days, when young reporters wait full of anticipation at the Senate entrance for their colleagues to sign them in for their first day on the Canberra beat, they have been selected for different reasons. Knowing something of the territory still matters, it\u2019s still desirable, self-evidently \u2013 but proven capacity in the rigours of the 24/7 news cycle and digital fluency probably matter more, at least in the mainstream press.\nMy next 10 years brought constant transition, which has completely revolutionised the way I do things\nThe AFR might still hire the odd person like me but I suspect I\u2019d struggle to get in the door anywhere else. I was a lateral hire, a risk. I knew what I knew but I needed to be taught on the job how to be a journalist. Canberra political reporting is one of the most competitive and relentless environments in Australia journalism. The cycle never sleeps. These days we are too busy for risks, or for intense on-the-job incubation.\nWhen I walked in to the parliamentary press gallery in January 1996 I walked into a corridor populated by big newspaper bureaus and big television and radio bureaus.\nThere was bustle but it was an orderly sort of business. We worked hard, or we thought we did. Down the newspaper end of the corridor we filed several stories a day in a great rush in the evening. Our job was not to record the moment, it was to throw forward. We were concerned with tomorrow\u2019s news, not today\u2019s. We were print, and proudly so. Writers.\nThere was no rolling news cycle, apart from the wire services and the hardworking radio journalists, who filed every hour. We weren\u2019t podcasters, bloggers, photographers, television talking heads, live radio talent, tweeters, Facebookers, Instagramers, Periscopers.\nAt least we weren\u2019t until the great disruption. By the great disruption I mean, of course, the arrival of the internet. Digital, when it arrived, smashed all the old, long-cherished demarcations. The era of specialisation was behind us.\nNobody asked us whether or not we wanted this to happen. It just happened, and we had to adjust. Some of us didn\u2019t get the chance to adjust \u2013 successive redundancy rounds loomed grimly alongside our brave new world.\nSo, I had 10 years of being just one thing.\nMy next 10 years in political journalism brought constant transition, which has completely revolutionised the way I do things.\nWhile the \u201cwhat\u201d and the \u201chow\u201d of what I do is a world away from the comparative calm of 1996, the journalistic mission has remained constant and the values underpinning my practice have become more important than ever.\nIn this essay, I\u2019d like to share some of the changes of this period and consider their impact on my journalism.\nDon't lament the comments thread \u2013 sharp audience feedback is fine with me Read more\nActive readers and established beats\nThe most significant change over my decade in transition has been the rise of the reader. At the start of my career I was a print journalist. I wrote for a newspaper. Readers were important but distant. They were on the letters page. There was my dentist, who took great delight in informing his receptionist this woman who was about to be liberated from her wisdom teeth \u201cworked at the Financial Review\u201d. There was the odd person at a party. There were the regular letter writers, often elderly, sometimes abusive.\nI\u2019m no longer a print journalist. Technology has pushed me into another professional form \u2013 a digital form. That same technology has brought readers much closer.\nThey talk to me, and each other, at length in the comments thread under the live blog I write when federal parliament sits. They are in my inbox 24/7, with tips, bouquets and brickbats. They want to follow me in Instagram and Facebook, and they talk to me on Twitter. They give me instant feedback when I\u2019m on Insiders on the ABC, or on the radio, or Sky News. The reader is now right beside me, because technology connects us all, and makes everyone a micro-publisher.\nThe US journalism academic Jay Rosen calls modern news consumers \u201cthe people formerly known as the audience\u201d \u2013 he likens them to passengers on a ship who have decamped to build a boat of their own.\n\u201cThe people formerly known as the audience wish to inform media people of our existence, and of a shift in power that goes with the platform shift you\u2019ve all heard about,\u201d Rosen says. \u201cThink of passengers on your ship who got a boat of their own. The writing readers. The viewers who picked up a camera. The formerly atomised listeners who with modest effort can connect with each other and gain the means to speak\u2014 to the world, as it were.\u201d\nKatharine Viner, launch editor of Guardian Australia, and now the editor-in-chief of our global operation, explains the change thus.\n\u201cDigital is not about putting up your story on the web. It\u2019s about a fundamental redrawing of journalists\u2019 relationship with our audience, how we think about our readers, our perception of our role in society, our status. We are no longer the all-seeing all-knowing journalists, delivering words from on high for readers to take in, passively, save perhaps an occasional letter to the editor. Digital has wrecked those hierarchies almost overnight, creating a more levelled world, where responses can be instant, where some readers will almost certainly know more about a particular subject than the journalist.\u201d\nTo people outside contemporary journalism, noting this change might seem a simple cultural curiosity. But as Viner and Rosen correctly assert, operationally, this is a major structural shift.\nOnce journalists could get away with \u201cvoice of God\u201d journalism \u2013 preaching to an audience with confected certainties. It was a fiction so absurd it could only sustained in an era when the readers didn\u2019t actually talk back.\nThe rise of the reader: journalism in the age of the open web | Katharine Viner Read more\nOnce readers gained equality with the folks paid to put down the first draft of history, once they gained the option to micro-publish and share their interventions, the jig was well and truly up. Our tone had to shift. Journalists, readers and viewers will be delighted to know, have had humility thrust upon us. Not all of us, mind you. But some of us, certainly.\nFrom my own perspective the rise of the reader is a welcome development. At its best, the new environment is more democratic, more vibrant, more interesting, more stimulating and more honest, both for the journalist and for the reader.\nI\u2019ve pushed the engagement philosophy in my own practice. I make it a priority to speak to readers \u201cbelow the line\u201d \u2013 in the comments threads under my live politics blog or my Dispatches column. I also engage with readers on social media.\nI think all contemporary journalists should approach readers as equal participants in the national discourse.\nNot just say that. Mean it.\nBut the equality philosophy presents working journalists with an interesting conundrum. If we are no longer asserting our privileged status, can we still assert the value of our specialist knowledge?\nI believe we can.\nA news organisation paid me for years on end to cover the same approximate beat David Simon, creator of The Wire\nAnd the reason we can is because Canberra remains an important bedrock of \u201cbeat\u201d journalism. In my view, the journalistic beat is the heart of who we are and what we do. Technology may have transformed print and broadcast specialists into harried multi-taskers, but technology hasn\u2019t changed the mission. The journalistic mission remains at its simplest: know your patch and use your knowledge to try to tell readers what\u2019s actually going on.\nAs the former Baltimore Sun journalist David Simon \u2013 creator of TV shows including The Wire and Treme \u2013 says on the subject of beat journalism: \u201cThe reason I am able to tell you this story is not because I am now an amateur or because I have a blog. It is, above all, because a news organisation paid me for years on end to cover the same approximate beat on a full-time basis. I did it for 50 or 60 hours a week because the Baltimore Sun had a sufficient revenue stream to pay me a living wage and benefits so that I could take a mortgage and raise a family and show up to do the work on a daily basis.\u201d\nAs the industry contracts, it is beat journalism that finds itself most under threat. It is hard to maintain a rounds structure or a beat structure when the newsroom is shrinking and there are more platforms to service in any given 24 hours. As a devotee of the beat, I have a rakish pride in Canberra\u2019s capacity to roll on relentlessly in flagrant opposition to an industry trend which, on my analysis, is our most troubling form of iterative extinction.\nBy rolling on I mean this: we show up. We get to know the protagonists. We watch the cycles of politics, long enough to see them repeat. We outlast the various ministerial staff and often the ministers who periodically vow to extract terrible career-ending revenge because something undesirable has been written. As one of the press gallery\u2019s leading lights, Laura Tingle, noted to the then social services minister Scott Morrison at a National Press Club event in February 2015: \u201cI plan to be here long after I\u2019ve seen you off.\u201d Morrison\u2019s response to that light-hearted provocation? \u201cWonderful.\u201d Tingle\u2019s response to that: \u201cI thought you\u2019d be pleased.\u201d\nWe do acquire expert, detailed, valuable knowledge. Our staying power fills our brains with context which informs all kinds of judgments. But to continue to say that, we need to be worthy of trust.\nTrust requires honesty. It requires some collective self-knowledge. It requires the capacity to be humble before an audience, which is a trait journalists are always reluctant to show. Journalists are supposed to be crusaders and people who trade on our knowledge. We project as authoritative. We are not supposed to admit both ourselves and our processes are, periodically, flawed.\nHere\u2019s my personal contribution to the collective humility requirement. We political journalists don\u2019t always get things right. We sometimes produce race call commentary and gotcha rubbish that isn\u2019t worth the reader\u2019s time. We can lapse into herd instincts. Some of us are capable of abuses of power. We can also be captured by the protagonists, which might work for them, but doesn\u2019t work for the reader.\nAs a journalist who goes looking for audience feedback, I hear rather a lot of it\nFor a political journalist, remaining independent is a conscious choice. You have to want to be independent, even if it means you are off the Christmas card list, or the prime minister\u2019s office \u201caccidentally on purpose\u201d forgets to brief you when they\u2019ve briefed 10 other colleagues. You can miss stories when you refuse to act as someone\u2019s drop box. Missing stories is generally frowned upon by the bosses in our line of work, so politicians and their operatives use the baseline anxiety to try to herd cats, or they use information in calculated ways \u2013 briefing a person they want to advance, blocking a person they don\u2019t approve of.\nIt\u2019s quite funny at one level, the pettiness of it. Sometimes the kindergarten tactics work, sometimes they don\u2019t. Asserting independence requires a certain clarity of mission: \u201cI write for readers, I don\u2019t write to amplify your agenda, or to impress someone.\u201d\nAs a journalist who goes looking for audience feedback, I hear rather a lot of it. I hear how deficient I am, or how deficient the parliamentary press gallery is; I hear how the gallery makes things up; how various journalists are undeclared cyphers for various politicians. Readers observe I\u2019m an idiot for writing that Tony Abbott is intelligent, or allege that I have a corrosive bias against Bill Shorten.\nPushing out to readers rather than standing back, convinced you know better, is a bit like being a surgeon performing a delicate operation while a small crowd gathers to tell you how you should be cutting, or stitching, or clamping.\nAs I\u2019ve already noted, some of the criticism about gallery reporting is entirely justified. But I do periodically consume criticism of the press gallery that is about as shallow and uninformed as the worst of our work.\nThe gallery is regularly said to be monolithic. We are not. My corridor in 2015 is populated by a diverse group of journalists working at different levels with different personal aspirations. Some of us work for good bosses who prize the integrity of the work above all else. Some of us don\u2019t.\nSome of the shallow critiques readily traverse the what but never pause to ask why.\nThe fact is we are working in challenging conditions: the most challenging conditions I have yet inhabited. The rolling news cycle creates conditions in which small things can gain disproportionate coverage (more of this shortly.)\nThis is a broad generalisation, but it think it holds \u2013 we\u2019ve gone from the placid news cycle I started in, which served to amplify the messages of politicians in largely orderly and linear fashion \u2013 to a cycle of constant cross-current, contention and disruption. It can be hard to keep your feet, your nerve and your clarity in such conditions.\nAudiences want their news now. They don\u2019t want to wait for us to think for several more hours\nTo summarise the arguments: Canberra is a journalistic beat and mastery of the beat remains the essence of daily journalism. But to continue to assert that right, we need to be accurate, we need to be trustworthy and we need to listen to voices and perspectives other than our own.\nListen. Yes, really.\nCapturing the reader\u2019s trust is central to our mission. In my view, it\u2019s the most important thing we now do, and they way we do it is by reaching out, explaining and building community. There are no shortcuts.\nThe importance of the audience and the lure of the \u2018new\u2019\nThe rise of the internet and the proximity of the audience has increased the intensity of everything in our professional world. We have entered a fully connected life, which both enriches and punishes its inhabitants.\nAudiences want their news now. They don\u2019t want to wait for us to think for several more hours before bringing them up to speed, they want it in real time.\nOur analytical audience measurement tools tell us with brutal precision what audiences are reading, how long they read it for, how much they\u2019ve shared it.\nKeeping engaged audiences engaged has become an existential challenge for daily commercial media journalism. With readers we can generate revenue, and live. If they desert us, we die.\nI\u2019ve already indicated that the digital news cycle requires a completely different approach than print. Our working day begins much earlier and often wraps late. We don\u2019t just write anymore, we talk on video, we podcast, we blog, we live stream, we meme.\nWe have had to will our minds to work faster, to not only chase new facts but to provide clarity and context in the moment, because that\u2019s the expectation of the audience.\nThe rolling news cycle is a hungry beast and its fuel is the \u201cnew\u201d.\nThe print cycle of two decades ago imposed a simple discipline. \u201cNew\u201d wasn\u2019t enough to make the cut. The development had to be both new and important.\nIf it was new and important it would appear on page one or page three or page five \u2013 still important 24 hours after it happened. The important made it to the top of the list, and the intra-day static fell away to three paragraphs at the bottom of the story, or to the cutting-room floor.\nI\u2019m not meaning to imply the old print cycle saved readers from inaccuracies or defamations or distortions or poor judgments \u2013 it didn\u2019t, of course. But scarcity did impose a discipline that is fast becoming an anachronism. It is not uncommon to see a story running prominently on a news website that would not have made the paper 20 years ago \u2013 simply because it is new, not because we really need to know. Good news organisations still apply the old judgment matrix, a story must be both new and important to gain prominent display. But these values are not always applied universally.\nFrom my perspective, the consequential professional response to the rise of the reader should be to deliver better, richer, more informed, more collaborative journalism because there are ample opportunities to do just that. Our collective ambition should not be to dish up breaking fluff with an over-egged headline in the desperate hope that audiences will fail to grasp the difference.\nBut this sort of integrity can be hard to assert. It requires editorial leaders to keep their heads and their feet in a maelstrom. It requires reporters to say no when they are asked to produce or chase material devoid of value and offer up smarter ways of coming at the content.\nIn short, prioritising quality over disposability requires experience, guts, and a steady hand, and it requires the professional will to make the internet serve the journalistic mission rather than allowing the thready impulses of the web or the bandwagon culture of social media to enslave the journalism.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Canberra bureaus are smaller than they were a decade ago and the demands on their denizens are exponentially greater.\u2019 Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian\nIt is very easy for breaking canapes, or breaking gossip, or breaking half facts to shoot to the top of Google news alerts, or start trending on social media, which generates entirely rational pressure for news websites to jump on board and chase those clicks.\nSome thoughts for young journalists\nI want to end this essay by looping back to the beginning. I entered political journalism in my mid 20s as a lateral hire. As I noted in the opening, I\u2019m entirely confident I would not get a job now.\nIn 1996 I walked into a fully staffed Canberra bureau where senior correspondents had time to mentor my transition from public servant to journalist. I owe my career to a handful of people who worked intensively with me to make sure I made that transition successfully. Now senior correspondents in Canberra, and news editors, have less time. There is no less will, no less professional generosity, but there is less time. Bureaus are smaller than they were a decade ago and the demands on their denizens are exponentially greater.\nThe best thing that\u200b happened to me as a reporter was being encouraged by my mentors to listen and watch and learn\nNow there\u2019s a tendency to bring in recruits with a proven track record in metropolitan newsrooms, and there\u2019s an expectation that everyone will do a bit of everything, not specialise in a particular journalistic skill set.\nPart of what employers are looking for is energy and acumen: surviving the rigours of Canberra\u2019s highly competitive breaking news culture requires a significant capacity for hard work, and it requires having the skills and networks to promote your work.\nGetting the work out there is now a collective exercise, not a contribution made externally to news organisation by newsagents and other distributors. Dealing your work into the digital conversation is an important requirement of contemporary journalism.\nYoung reporters seeking to come to Canberra for a long time or for a short time are walking into a more chaotic and demanding and uncertain and contested professional world than the one I entered. But it is a richer ecosystem in almost every respect.\nIt\u2019s a more diverse world. The digital revolution has opened the field for new players. The young reporters formerly known as print journalists don\u2019t now just have to wonder whether they will work for News Corporation or for Fairfax Media. They can now also contemplate working for Guardian Australia, or Crikey, or BuzzFeed, or Junkee, or for the Huffington Post, or for the online sites of the ABC and SBS. The offering is more vibrant than it was a decade ago \u2013 and that\u2019s before we get to the blogs and specialist publications \u2013 but of course it\u2019s no utopia. Well-paid, secure jobs are hard to find and the future of commercial media remains uncertain.\nNews organisations have distinct editorial voices, and presentational styles, meaning there\u2019s no one size fits all. The nascent diversity means young reporters need to have digital skills, social media fluency, and a flexible attitude \u2013 and I think reporters who understand and embrace a reader-centred philosophy will put themselves philosophically where they need to be in order to prosper in their chosen vocation.\nHack to the future: will a journalism degree help your job prospects? Read more\nWhile young reporters need new skills, the advice I got from my mentors 20 years ago remains constant. Get your facts straight, and if you don\u2019t have your facts straight, don\u2019t rush to publish them.\nThe digital world can sanction the corrosive \u201cnever wrong for long\u201d philosophy but while the technology allows rapid resetting in the event of error, adopt a blase attitude at your peril. If contemporary journalism demands that reporters cultivate their personal brand, and enter a contract with active readers where trust is central to the sharing and the conversation, then accuracy is actually more important now than it has ever been.\nI do a great deal of live work at Guardian Australia, which exposes me to the constant risk of error, overstatement and cock-up. I\u2019m periodically guilty of all of these sins. But I\u2019m also clear in my approach. Having presided over a live blog for several years, I\u2019d rather be running just behind the action with reliable content than just ahead of the action with speculative or unreliable content.\nOlder reporters always have a tendency to say this to younger reporters but it\u2019s right in the main. The second piece of advice apart from get it right is watch and learn before you give the readers the benefit of your wisdom.\nThe cycle is hungry for content, and for opinion, the more outrageous the better. The best thing that happened to me as a reporter was being encouraged by my mentors to listen and watch and learn and serve a careful apprenticeship before I wandered into analytical territory. The views I would have been delighted to express to anyone who would listen during my first 10 years on the job would really not have been worth listening to, so I\u2019m very glad I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to share them.\nPolitical reporting today requires tenacity, at times it requires courage, it requires nuance \u2013 a vastly under-rated attribute in our \u201cshouty\u201d world. It requires the capacity to keep your feet, both with the new material that thrusts itself to you 24/7, and with the political class who are always intent on cajoling, hectoring or otherwise persuading you to accept the rightness and inherent virtue of their various propositions.\nIt requires a deep scepticism, which should never be confused with a deep cynicism. As Oscar Wilde once observed, a cynic is someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.\nMy vocation requires you to play a long game, even if you only inhabit the hothouse for a short time.\nBut what it requires now, 20 years ago, 20 years from now, is truth seekers.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what platform we produce on, whether the demands are many or few, whether there is certainty, the illusion of certainty, or no certainty at all \u2013 the vocation is constant.\nIt requires a deep-seated desire to serve the public by speaking truth to power.\n\u2022 Katharine Murphy is adjunct associate professor of journalism at the University of Canberra as well as Guardian Australia\u2019s deputy political editor.

He went on to cover the contest for UK and Irish audiences for more than three decades. \u201cAll I\u2019ve gained by watching the Eurovision Song Contest over the years is a numbing of the prefrontal lobes,\u201d Wogan once said. \u201cTen seconds after the contest has finished, I\u2019ve forgotten every song \u2026 The whole thing has become an astounding, huge, grandiose load of rubbish.\nOne of the founders of the BBC\u2019s Children in Need, Wogan began presenting the annual charity appeal in 1978, when it began as a five-minute broadcast on Christmas Day. It became a live evening of programmes in 1980 and Wogan hosted the event until 2014. He faced criticism in 2007 after it was revealed he was paid a fee for the show, which he later waived.\nUnlikely pop star\nWogan\u2019s version of The Floral Dance was a top 30 hit in 1978. A follow-up single, Me and the Elephant, was less memorable, and he remains better known for playing records than making them. He returned to the recording studio to make cover versions of Silver Bells and Little Drummer Boy/Peace on Earth, with Aled Jones, for Children in Need.\nWogan presented BBC1 TV quiz show Blankety Blank for four years until 1983. It was famous for its bargain-basement prizes \u2013 including the infamous consolation prize, the Blankety Blank chequebook and pen \u2013 and Wogan\u2019s wand-like microphone that panellist Kenny Everett regularly tried to break in half. Wogan was succeeded as host by Les Dawson and, later, Paul O\u2019Grady.\nThe most infamous episode of his BBC1 talkshow was the appearance by a drunken George Best in 1990. \u201cI could see him coming at me from across the stage, the eyes were glazed and I knew the worst had happened,\u201d Wogan recalled. \u201cHe\u2019d shunted down several bucketfuls in about five minutes. He was drunk as a skunk.\u201d Other memorable appearances came courtesy of Anne Bancroft and David Icke.\nHonorary knighthood\nPlain old Terry Wogan became Sir Terry in 2005 when he was given an honorary knighthood. He joined a select group, including Bob Geldof and Bill Gates, to receive the honour, usually only bestowed on British and Commonwealth citizens. If followed an honorary OBE in 1997.\nWith nearly 8 million listeners, Wogan had long been the most popular breakfast show in the country. He once described Radio 1\u2019s Chris Moyles, who has the second most popular breakfast show, as \u201cin doubtful taste\u201d. Moyles responded by saying he would \u201ctear that wig off his head and shove it up his arse\u201d.\nNot everything Wogan touched turned to broadcasting gold. His short-lived Channel Five talkshow, The Terry and Gaby Show, which he presented with Gaby Roslin, was dropped in 2004 because of poor ratings. The show was made by a production company run by the man who replaced him on Radio 2, Chris Evans.\n\u2018It\u2019s Cyndi!\u2019\nHis most inauspicious broadcasting moment was announcing the wrong winner at the end of BBC1\u2019s Eurovision Song Contest heats in 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s Cyndi!\u201d announced Wogan. \u201cIt\u2019s Scooch!\u201d corrected his co-presenter, Fearne Cotton. If Wogan was upset, it was nothing compared with how Cyndi felt. The BBC\u2019s director general, Mark Thompson, absolved Wogan of all blame.\nAs well as being one of the BBC\u2019s biggest stars, Wogan was also one of its most outspoken. \u201cWhen I started, people who worked for the BBC knew they weren\u2019t earning as much as people in commercial television, but they did have the satisfaction of knowing that they worked for one of the finest, if not the finest, broadcasting organisation in the whole world,\u201d he said in 2008. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they feel that any more, or at least that it means as much as it used to.\u201d\nWogan\u2019s sardonic commentary was invariably the best thing about Eurovision, on which he commentated for 35 years. But it was no laughing matter when he stepped down in 2008 after tiring of bloc voting and complaining it was \u201cno longer a music contest\u201d. He was replaced by Graham Norton. Wogan later described the musical jamboree as a \u201ctriumph of appalling taste\u201d and said \u201ceveryone knows it\u2019s rubbish\u201d.\nCountless hours of morning companionship\nAfter 27 years \u2013 in two stints \u2013 on the BBC Radio 2 breakfast show, Wogan announced on air in September 2009 that he would be stepping down and that Chris Evans would succeed him. \u201cI wanted to be the first to tell you,\u201d he told listeners. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I owe you, for endless years, countless hours of morning companionship, friendship, good humour, and laughter. Your loyalty and support has been a beacon of love in my life.\u201d\nWogan returned to radio in February 2010 when he began hosting the Sunday morning Weekend Wogan show. The final broadcast of the show was in November 2015.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T07:22:20", "author": "John Plunkett", "lang": "en", "topic": "Terry Wogan|Television|BBC|news", "category": "UK|media", "title": "Terry Wogan's rise to fame: Irish grocer's son to legendary broadcaster", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Famously outspoken, he was knighted after dominating TV and radio for 50 years, and even became an unlikely pop star"},

Appended to the article was the following statement:\nAs Poynter\u2019s Benjamin Mullin pointed out, this certainly challenged \u201ctraditional notions of journalistic neutrality.\u201d\nRyan Grim, HuffPo\u2019s Washington bureau chief, told Poynter: \u201cWe will never stop reminding our audience who Trump is and what his campaign really represents.\u201d\nAlthough another HuffPo spokesman said the note would appear below all its articles about Trump, I can\u2019t locate any other examples.\nIt was not published under stories such as \u201cTrump\u2019s Hollywood star is vandalised with a swastika\u201d; \u201cDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton lead Iowa caucus poll\u201d; and \u201cA Democrat explains why she\u2019s voting for Donald Trump\u201d.\nSo perhaps there has since been a change of mind. HuffPo has done that before. In July 2015, it moved Trump coverage to its entertainment section, calling his campaign a \u201csideshow\u201d, but it reversed that decision in December.\nThis time around, Grim defended the innovation by arguing that it was fair because \u201cthese are merely statements of fact.\u201d Asked about the possible impact on readers, he said:\n\u201cWe\u2019re not telling them what to think, we\u2019re telling them what we think... Being fully upfront and honest with readers is a mark of our respect for their ability to think freely and for themselves.\u201d\nHuffPo is hardly alone among US media in dealing with Trump in a very different fashion to its treatment of any other politician.\nAt the beginning of December, the Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank wrote a commentary headlined \u201cDonald Trump is a bigot and a racist\u201d.\nHe noted: \u201cThere is a greater imperative not to be silent in the face of demagoguery. Trump in this campaign has gone after African Americans, immigrants, Latinos, Asians, women, Muslims and now the disabled.\u201d And he went on to list Trump\u2019s sins:\nTrump led the \u2018birther\u2019 movement challenging President Obama\u2019s standing as a natural-born American; used various vulgar expressions to refer to women; spoke of Mexico sending rapists and other criminals across the border; called for rounding up and deporting 11 million illegal immigrants; had high-profile spats with prominent Latino journalists and news outlets; mocked Asian accents; let stand a charge made in his presence that Obama is a Muslim and that Muslims are a \u2018problem\u2019 in America; embraced the notion of forcing Muslims to register in a database; falsely claimed thousands of Muslims celebrated the 9/11 attacks in New Jersey; tweeted bogus statistics asserting that most killings of whites are done by blacks; approved of the roughing up of a black demonstrator at one of his events; and publicly mocked the movements of New York Times (and former Washington Post) journalist Serge Kovaleski, who has a chronic condition limiting mobility.\nAlso in December, BuzzFeed\u2019s editor-in-chief, Ben Smith, told his journalists they could call Trump a liar and \u201cmendacious racist\u201d.\nIn a memo to staff, Smith said of Tump: \u201cHe\u2019s out there saying things that are false and running an overtly anti-Muslim campaign. BuzzFeed News\u2019s reporting is rooted in facts, not opinion; these are facts.\u201d\nNone of it appears to have dissuaded thousands of Americans from supporting Trump. Indeed, it may well convince people of the distance between them and the so-called \u201cliberal media.\u201d\nThey will view it as proof that media outlets, old and new, are unrepresentative of their opinions and attitudes.\nIt is a further example of the way in which the success of Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy has revealed a deep political, social and cultural split in modern America.\nSources: Washington Post/Poynter/Politico/Guardian", "date_time": "2016-02-01T08:40:32", "author": "Roy Greenslade", "lang": "en", "topic": "Media|Greenslade|Huffington Post|Republicans|Washington Post|US press and publishing|BuzzFeed|blogposts", "category": "UK|media", "title": "Media outlets dare to call Donald Trump a liar, racist and misogynist", "source": "guardian", "intro": "HuffPo appends a critical note to online articles about the Republican contender that challenges the \u2018traditional notions of journalistic neutrality\u2019"},

However, research published last week by GlobalWebIndex suggested that the number of people blocking ads on mobiles is rapidly approaching the same level.\nSamsung\u2019s decision is likely to have less impact than Apple\u2019s because many users of its Android operating system use Google\u2019s Chrome browser, which is automatically offered as a way to open links on the devices.\nGoogle makes the vast majority of its revenue from advertising and is unlikely to be enthusiastic about adblocking.

{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/feb/01/why-the-heralds-editor-fired-a-columnist-in-row-with-rangers", "content": "The row over the firing of a columnist at Glasgow\u2019s Sunday Herald shows no signs of dying down.\nMembers of Scottish PEN, wrote a letter to the paper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Magnus Llewellin, to register their concern about Angela Haggerty being dismissed.\nThe letter, published on the website of the group that campaigns for freedom of expression, said its members are \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the newspaper\u2019s decision to sack Haggerty \u201cfor showing her support for fellow journalist Graham Spiers.\u201d\nSpiers decided he couldn\u2019t write for the Herald after disagreeing about the timing of its publication of an apology for one of his columns about the problems of bigotry \u201caround\u201d Rangers football club. Haggerty then expressed her support for him on Twitter.\nThe National Union of Journalists accused the Herald of \u201cpandering to the mob\u201d. It removed its statement for a while but later reinstated it.*\nLike Scottish PEN\u2019s admission that it was unaware of \u201cdetails\u201d about pressure exerted on the Herald by Rangers, the NUJ\u2019s decision reflected a lack of knowledge about the incident.\nMy understanding is that a single sentence in Spiers\u2019s column, an allegation about a Rangers board director, was regarded as defamatory.\nAlthough contentious articles are usually read for possible libels prior to publication by the paper\u2019s lawyers, Levy & McRae, an editorial staff error meant that Spiers\u2019s column, which was published on the Herald\u2019s website, slipped through the net.\nOnce Rangers objected, Llewellin found himself in a bind familiar to all journalists in such situations. He received legal advice saying the allegation was indefensible, and that if he tried to defend it - which he spent a fortnight initially trying to do - the paper would have faced major costs.\nCrucially, I understand that the costs would most likely have been borne by the editorial budget and, in Llewellin\u2019s view, could therefore have resulted in job cuts. (I\u2019ll deal with this in a moment).\nSo Llewellin felt he had to publish the apology. It stated: \u201cWe acknowledge every member of the Rangers board is fully committed to fighting bigotry and offensive chanting, wherever it occurs in Scottish football, and that the club is actively tackling the issue.\u201d\nIts publication upset Spiers who responded with an online statement saying he wanted more time to clarify his position. He realised that his opposition to the apology would effectively cut his ties with the Herald.\nHe acknowledged that he could afford to be bold because he has other income, writing for the Times and through broadcasting for the BBC.\nBut Haggerty, a relatively new columnist with the Sunday Herald, was sympathetic to Spiers\u2019s plight and, as someone who has previously suffered abuse from from Rangers fans after editing a book about the club, she wrote a tweet in which she complained about Rangers\u2019 bigotry.\nAs I wrote previously, she maintains that she was referring to fans, but the Herald saw it differently and considered it to be a reference to Rangers\u2019 directors. The paper therefore viewed it as a failure \u201cto act within the spirit of its apology.\u201d\nLewellin told me he regards Haggerty as \u201ca brave and talented journalist\u201d but her reference to \u201cglaring bigotry at Ibrox\u201d only hours \u201cafter we\u2019d published a very carefully worded apology to avoid legal action, she (unwittingly) undermined it.\u201d\nIn a Bella Caledonia piece about the circumstances of her sacking, Haggerty said Llewellin had informed her that \u201crepresentatives of Rangers Football Club\u201d had brought her tweets to the attention of the Herald, \u201cand that, to cut a long story short, the paper was under so much legal pressure that he felt he had no option but to let me go.\u201d\nShe wrote: \u201cHe also informed me that Neil MacKay, editor of the Sunday Herald, had fought strongly to stop it happening, but in the end he was overruled.\u201d Mackay underlined that fact in a tweet saying it was not his decision to remove Haggerty.\nI emailed Llewellin to ask if he would consider reinstating Haggerty but he replied that \u201cas things stand at present, and to show the good faith and collective responsibility... bringing her back would be difficult - for the time being at least.\u201d\nAt least that final phrase offers Haggerty a possible lifeline for the future, if she wishes to grab it.\nNow let me go back to that matter of legal costs being borne by the editorial department. I am not doubting Llewellin\u2019s word, but I am amazed that a publisher - in this case, Newsquest/Gannett - might expect an editor to sacrifice jobs over a legal action.\nThat casts the whole business of Llewellin\u2019s decision-making in a new light.\n*This sentence was amended after the NUJ reposted its statement", "date_time": "2016-02-01T11:53:44", "author": "Roy Greenslade", "lang": "en", "topic": "Media|Greenslade|Scotland|Media law|Newspapers|Newsquest|Gannett|blogposts", "category": "UK|scotland", "title": "Why the Herald's editor fired a columnist in row with Rangers", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Costs of legal action by football club might have led to newsroom job cuts"},

But based on what we monitored, we saw, in 2013-14, a turning point, a picking up of the number of tobacco scenes.\n\u201cThe tobacco industry has been looking at alternatives to promote their products and films is the last frontier for tobacco companies.\u201d\nWHO first called for films featuring smoking to be restricted to adult audiences \u2013 generally those aged 18 or over but the age of majority varies by country \u2013 in 2009.\nPeruga said it had renewed its campaign because no government had implemented the recommendation and amid fears that, as countries implement a WHO convention to ban tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, films become seen as a lucrative alternative.\nA US study suggests that on-screen smoking accounts for 37% of all new adolescent smokers. In 2014, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that exposure to on-screen smoking would recruit more than 6 million new, young smokers from among American children in 2014, of which 2 million would ultimately die from tobacco-induced diseases.\nPeruga said that attempts, largely in the US, to persuade film companies to comply with two other recommendations of the report \u2013 not to show brands and to include a statement in the credits saying that film producers receive nothing of value in exchange for tobacco products appearing \u2013 had fallen on deaf ears.\nA study of the 15 most commercially successful films in the UK between 1989 and 2008 found tobacco in 70% of all films, 92% of which were rated for children aged younger than 18. Specific brands appeared in 9% of films and was nearly twice as likely to occur in films originating wholly or in part in the UK.\n\u201cIn some films the percentage of tobacco scenes are far greater than you would see in the society in which the film is set,\u201d said Peruga.\nThe British Board of Film Classification said the public agreed that the classification of smoking in films should be proportionate and reflective of UK laws, so an adult smoking should not instantly require an 18 classification. But it said glamorisation of smoking was more likely to receive a higher classification.\nSimon Clark, the director of the smokers\u2019 group Forest, said: \u201cDisney has a no smoking policy for its PG 13-rated films, and that\u2019s fine, but films aimed at older audiences must be allowed to reflect real life, not some sanitised smoke-free world.\n\u201cPenalising films that portray smoking by giving them a rating equivalent to an 18 certificate is a clumsy and unnecessary attempt at censorship.\u201d", "date_time": "2016-02-01T01:01:13", "author": "Haroon Siddique", "lang": "en", "topic": "Smoking|World Health Organization|Health", "category": "UK|society", "title": "Films portraying smoking should get adult rating, says WHO", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Cigarette companies are turning to film industry to recruit next generation of smokers, warns World Health Organisation"},

You wouldn\u2019t expect GPs for example to visit patients in hospital when they have been admitted to hospital.\u201d\nHe said patients\u2019 existing GP practices could continue to provide care, but under separate arrangements and not if it was too stretched. \u201cThis is a government policy of moving many ill patients, who need to be receiving specialist care, outside of a hospital setting,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that GPs suddenly take on this work when in fact such patients do need specialist care ... What we have got at the moment is a contract that really makes no differentiation.\u201d\nGPs are currently obliged to carry out routine checkups once or twice a week for about 300,000 elderly people in care homes in England, as well as visiting any who suddenly become sick. Many require dedicated care and in the past would have been looked after in hospital.\nAt their special conference in London on Saturday, dozens of GPs\u2019 representatives spoke about how the workload they faced increased the risks to patients and made their jobs increasingly unbearable. At the conference, Nagpaul said it was not safe to see patients with complex multiple needs in 10-minute consultations or have 70 patient contacts each day in a \u201cconveyor belt\u201d system.\nThe vote to remove responsibility for patients in care homes came as GPs discussed what work or services they should cease,to reduce their workload to ensure safe and sustainable patient care. It means that the BMA is now likely to lobby for the change when the government announces a new contract for GPs this month. Elderly people\u2019s advocates expressed fears that the change could worsen care.\nCaroline Abrahams, of Age UK, told the Daily Mail: \u201cOlder people in care homes are just as entitled as anyone else to good NHS treatment and because many are frail and unwell.

Health spending per person steeply increases after the age of 50, with people aged 85 and over costing the NHS an average of \u00a37,000 a year. Spending on health services across all age groups is \u00a32,069, according to Treasury analysis.\nThe costs pressures are unlikely to abate. By 2039, people aged 65 or over are expected to represent 23% of the population, or 17.5 million, according to projections from the Office for National Statistics. About one in 12 of the population will be aged 80 or over by then.\nCurrently, there are 11.4 million people aged 65 or over in Britain, representing 18% of the total population, up from 12% in 1966.\nSurgery in the womb: miracle maker for NHS's tiniest patients Read more\n\u201cPeople in the UK live longer every year because we have learned to cure or prevent many of the diseases that once cut lives short,\u201d said Mark Dayan, policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust. \u201cToday, the NHS\u2019s staff and technology, and therefore its money, is increasingly focused on treating people in older age groups, with often long-term conditions that we struggle most with. That\u2019s a sign of success.\n\u201cBut it means that as more people stay alive and grow older, the cost of healthcare rises each year by 1 or 2% on top of wages and costly new drugs,\u201d he added. \u201cTo maintain and improve the health service, we need to constantly find more money or savings, usually both. This basic question of demographics and money lies behind most of the controversies across the NHS.\u201d\nAverage spending is higher for males until they reach 15 and once again after their mid-60s. Once they hit 80, men cost the NHS 8% more on average than women of the same age.\nNewborns also incur higher costs to the health services. In England, the Institute for Fiscal Studies [pdf] estimates hospital costs for boys at \u00a31,504 in the first year of life, compared with \u00a31,254 for baby girls. Newborns account for about 8% of hospital inpatients a year.\nThere were 776,352 live births in the UK in 2014, equivalent to 2,127 a day.\nDealing with complications at birth generates additional costs, the most common being jaundice and disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, both affecting 8% of newborns [pdf]. Failure to thrive \u2013 when the weight of a baby is insufficient \u2013 costs the NHS a minimum of \u00a3646 to treat.\nMaternity plays a key part in explaining the cost difference between men and women in adult life. Hospital costs for women aged between 20 and 35 are at least twice those for men of the same age.\nThis increase in cost for women is partially offset by mental health spending, which is higher for men in their 20s and 30s.\nThe amount spent on health services varies between different parts of the UK. Expenditure is highest in Scotland, at \u00a32,160 per person, and lowest in England at \u00a32,057.\nAt a regional level, health spending was 23% higher in London than the England-wide average. The east, south-east and east Midlands recorded the lowest spending, with an average of less than \u00a31,850 per person.\nThe data, which is based on identifiable expenditure (where the individuals who benefit from public spending can be located), shows that health spending per head is second only to social protection (\u00a33,927), but ahead of education (\u00a31,307), economic affairs (\u00a3582) and public order (\u00a3441).\nHealth is the service for which public expenditure has increased the most in the last 20 years. Treasury data shows that in real terms spending has more than doubled from \u00a362.8bn in 1994-95 to \u00a3134.1bn in 2014-15.

Both my arm and hand were numb. I immediately suspected a stroke. My sister-in-law had been left paralysed down her right side and unable to speak after a major stroke. We visited her most days to try to help her communicate, and I had read everything I could about strokes.\nIn fact, we had been discussing my sister-in-law\u2019s situation when I realised my arm had gone numb. I ran through the Fast checks in my mind: there was no pain, no dizziness, no symptoms other than my arm. But I remembered the t in Fast \u2013 time \u2013 was the most important. I asked my wife to call 999, deciding we could argue later if I was wrong.\nA first responder paramedic arrived in about five minutes from his base five miles away in Oakham [in Rutland]. He did vital signs checks and agreed with my tentative diagnosis so called an ambulance to take me straight to the stroke unit at Peterborough, some 25 miles away.\nOnce there I was quickly examined. As the symptoms had not worsened, I was kept in under observation. But when I got out of bed to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, my right leg would not work so I pressed the bell for help. In seconds a small army of people were there to take me first for a CT scan and then to a bay where a drip was fitted, blood samples were taken and a doctor did whatever doctors do.\nThe stroke unit nurse who had checked me in was with me the whole time, holding my hand and reassuring me that I was in the best possible hands. I must have been given a sedative because the next thing I remember was waking up in a private room. The nurse was still with me, and called in to see how I was at the start of every shift for my entire stay in Peterborough.\nThose first few days were very confusing because although I seemed able to think clearly, I could not speak or understand what people were saying. I made sounds that I thought were speech but could not make myself understood. A speech therapist gave me some exercises to practise with a mirror so the next time my wife visited I could say \u201cI love you\u201d and be understood.\nI was also beginning to understand what was being said. The first complete sentence I followed was in a conversation I overheard between a doctor and a physiotherapist: \u201cI don\u2019t think he will walk or talk again.\u201d I decided then and there to prove them wrong.\nBy the time I was moved to the rehab centre in Market Harborough, where I was born, three weeks after my stroke, I was reading, talking and moving my legs in some semblance of walking.\nThe secret physio's diary: 'I talk to him about lifestyle changes. He glazes over' Read more\nThen the serious rehab started. Every day I spent at least an hour in the gym, with exercises back in the ward too. The nursing assistants were a wonderful part of the team, becoming friends and gradually withdrawing assistance as I could do more. My speech had recovered well and all the visitors, many of whom I had not seen for 50 years, were the only speech therapy I needed.\nAfter four weeks in the rehab centre I returned to my home, which had been prepared by the amazing NHS teams. They had turned the dining room into a fully equipped hospital room with electric adjustable bed and all the gadgets I could need. My downstairs bathroom had been changed to accommodate me, and as soon as I got home the team started to call. At least four times a week a pair of physiotherapists would treat me for an hour and an occupational therapist would come for at least an hour a week. At the end of six weeks of home treatment I could do everything I could do before my stroke \u2013 but slower and sometimes differently.\nI\u2019ve been told by several healthcare professionals that my attitude has made such a difference. I\u2019ve never given up. I try to do whatever task is given to me without protest. And I\u2019ve accepted that complete recovery is not reasonably achievable but I\u2019m going to fight for every bit that is.\nI was able to fly to Vancouver for Christmas with my kids and on the way over I tried to list all the people who made this trip possible in less than a year after my stroke, but it is impossible to do. There have been so many people, with so many skills, from so many ethnicities.\nI thank you all in the NHS, the best medical system in the world.\nI thank my family and friends who have continued to support me.\nAnd I thank my wonderful wife.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T12:24:13", "author": "Elena Cresci|John Oakley|As Told To", "lang": "en", "topic": "NHS|This is the NHS|Hospitals|Health|features", "category": "UK|society", "title": "The NHS saved my life: I can't count all those who helped me after a stroke", "source": "guardian", "intro": "From first responder to occupational therapist, the amazing medical teams \u2013 and my determination \u2013 got me walking and talking again"},

The publication cites research that suggests that loneliness can be more damaging than smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and quotes a study that found that lonely people have a 64% increased chance of developing clinical dementia.\nIzzi Seccombe, LGA spokeswoman for public health, said: \u201cAs our population profile changes, and we have a larger proportion of over 65s and over 85s, loneliness is becoming an increasingly important public health concern.\n\u201cThe impact of loneliness can be devastating and costly \u2013 with consequences comparable to smoking and obesity.\u201d\nBetter solutions needed to support older people leaving hospital care Read more\nThe south west of England has a population age profile 10 to 15 years ahead of the rest of the country, thanks to Devon and Cornwall\u2019s popularity as places to retire to in the UK. Research carried out in the region last year found that a third of patients admitted to A&E had very infrequent social interactions during the study period \u2013 less than once a month, or never. The research report concluded: \u201cWith social isolation strongly correlated with poor health outcomes, there is clearly work that could be done to improve the social interaction of the people in this study.\u201d\nDay care centres for the elderly can help alleviate this sense of isolation, but health care providers report that fewer people are accessing them, as a result of cuts to local authority budgets.\nDr Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cServices in the community, such as day centres for the elderly, can go a long way to alleviating loneliness and related conditions \u2013 but they are under considerable financial pressure. It\u2019s really important that they are protected.\u201d\nNuzhat Ali, older adults lead at Public Health England, said: \u201cThe health impact of loneliness is significant; in relation to older adults there is evidence that it impacts on depression, anxiety and low self-esteem. There is evidence to show that depression can progress the onset and speed with which dementia develops.\u201d\nLoneliness also reduces the speed with which older people recover from illnesses. Keith Willett said: \u201cThe low levels of mood, mild depression, that come from isolation and loneliness are significant contributors to patients not taking an interest in their care, because they feel noone else is interested in them.\n\u201cLow mood is not conducive to making a bouncy recovery. They may not look after themselves, they are not interested in their health, they may not bother to keep warm, they may not bother to take medication, because they don\u2019t see a strong purpose.\u201d\nAccording to Willett, the practical consequences of older people living alone, without support, places a huge burden on the NHS, which becomes \u201cthe end point of a pathway where unsupported patients end up\u201d. \u201cIt is a much wider societal problem\u201d, which individuals, local authorities and the NHS have a joint responsibility to tackle, he added.\nWillett advocates a transformation in the way the NHS looks after older people to \u201cbring care to them at home\u201d, to avoid the expensive, traumatic and unnecessary hospitalisation of older patients who would be much happier receiving care in the familiar setting of their own home.\n\u201cOlder people who arrive in hospital usually spend longer in hospital, and that\u2019s not ideal for them; that is not where they do well. They often have protracted stays, occupying acute facilities, when often they don\u2019t have an acute medical problem, they really have a social care problem,\u201d he said.\nUnder the current health care system patient support and care is provided \u201cby moving them to a medical setting because we don\u2019t provide it in a societal way in the community\u201d, Willett said. \u201cIf that continues it will cripple the efficiency and effectiveness of our health care to those who do need acute care.\u201d", "date_time": "2016-02-01T12:29:56", "author": "Amelia Gentleman", "lang": "en", "topic": "NHS|This is the NHS|Health|Ageing|news", "category": "UK|society", "title": "Loneliness 'forces older people into hospitals' and strains services, say senior doctors", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Call for community support and recognition of the effects of isolation, which is becoming a \u2018major health concern\u2019"},

So NHS innovators have a new mantra: keep them out of hospital\nIn December, after her third fall in a few months, Doris Carpenter was admitted to Rochdale infirmary. Carpenter is 84 and lives alone, but she is increasingly unsteady on her feet, and if she falls, she hasn\u2019t the strength to get up again. Previously, a call to 111 would summon paramedics who could put her back into a chair, but it was increasingly clear she wasn\u2019t coping, and needed more support.\nThis is not like any old hospital ward, however. Today Carpenter is not in bed but sitting in a chair, dressed in her own clothes, a fat Dan Brown book in front of her. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel quite so much \u2026 like you\u2019re in hospital,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce they know you can move around they stop supervising you.\u201d\nTwo side rooms have been furnished with small groups of tables and chairs, with bright crockery and tablecloths. Those patients who are able can help themselves to food at mealtimes and sit with others to eat, or go to the library to select another page-turner. A physiotherapist based in the unit helps Carpenter with her painful back, and is working to help improve her confidence on stairs.\nPreviously, an elderly person in Carpenter\u2019s position would most likely have ended up in an acute hospital ward.\nThere, very frequently, people of her age and profile would get stuck, and many would go downhill fast.\n\u201cThey come into hospital, and our model in the NHS is to put them to bed,\u201d says Steve Taylor, the divisional director for integrated and community services at Pennine acute hospitals trust. \u201cPut your pyjamas on, you stay in that bed, we will feed you and toilet you.\u201d\nShockingly quickly, he says, patients can lose what abilities they previously had. \u201cAnd then, when it comes time to discharge you, you can no longer walk.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Community nurse Veronica Peters visits 103-year-old Alfred Mann in Croydon. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian\nThis is arguably the biggest challenge facing the NHS \u2013 the problem of an older population, the long years of infirmity that many of us will face and a fragile social care system underpinning it all.\nThe number of people aged over 80 in Britain is expected to more than double to more than 6 million by 2030; the number of people over 100 could rise ninefold from 13,000 to 111,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. About two-thirds of patients admitted to hospital are over 65, and this proportion is rising.\nThe only solution, many doctors and health managers believe, is to make the NHS work in an entirely new way, properly joining up medical services with social support. Integrating health services and local authority-provided social care alongside voluntary services has become an increasing priority for the NHS, and is now a key plank of planning for health providers. It\u2019s just a matter of finding the best way to do it, and fast.\nIn Rochdale, the opportunity to rethink how care was provided came after the town\u2019s Victorian infirmary was downgraded. No longer a busy district general hospital of 350 beds in which no fewer than five wards were full, most of the time, of frail elderly patients, its inpatient beds were slashed, at one point, to just 15.\nThe widespread ambition across the NHS to cut unnecessary hospital admissions of elderly people and reduce the length of their stays became an urgent one. But this was also an opportunity for Rochdale. If health and social care could work together, and people were properly supported to leave hospital quickly and return home, the stretched resources of both services could go so much further. After all, notes Taylor, if you can reduce the length of time someone stays in hospital from six days to two, 15 beds is the equivalent of 45.\n\u201cWe have lots of beds, but most of them are out there,\u201d says hospital consultant Shona McCallum, gesturing at the window. \u201cThe beds are their own beds.\u201d\nThis principle - taking healthcare out of hospitals and into the homes of older people - is becoming increasingly widespread across the country as NHS managers and local authorities grapple with the burgeoning need. Two hundred and fifty miles from Rochdale, a new initiative in Croydon is seeking to address the same issue.\nA targeted team, looking after 500 vulnerable older people, operates alongside an acute care of the elderly (ACE) service at Croydon University hospital. This new seven-day clinic gives rapid specialist assistance to people referred by their GPs or social workers, and helps to prevent them from being brought by ambulance to A&E. Those older patients who do turn up at casualty are fast-tracked to be seen by consultants, before (ideally) being discharged to continue treatment at home.\nI\u2019ve played golf since 1937, sometimes two rounds a day.\nEvery couple of weeks, Veronica Peters, a community nurse with Croydon\u2019s health visiting team for older people, comes to visit Alfred Mann, a 103-year-old widower, who lives alone. His three daughters (in their 70s) shop for him, but Peters keeps a close watch on his health.\nShe has ordered bits of equipment that have helped him remain in the home where he has lived for the past 30 years: a rail by the back door and in the bathroom; a walking frame to let him continue gardening, and so he can get food from the kitchen to the room where he eats; and an emergency button he wears around his neck, in case he falls.\nPeters has arranged for a physiotherapist to teach Mann exercises that have helped him to stay mobile. Before she began visiting him, he had had a few falls that without this practical assistance would probably have resulted in a hospital admission.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t manage without you, love. You\u2019ve done so much for me,\u201d he tells her, in the cheerful, energetic voice of a much younger man. He puts his good health down to gymnastics, his continued love of jazz music (he no longer plays the banjo because his hands are not up to it, but he listens to his records) and a lifetime spent playing golf (\u201cI\u2019ve played golf since 1937, sometimes two rounds a day. I was still playing at 100. Imagine all the miles I have completed.\u201d).\nHe thinks he wouldn\u2019t still be at home without the health team\u2019s visits. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be alive if it wasn\u2019t for them. I have had wonderful treatment. I\u2019m very very grateful for all the help they\u2019ve given me.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Veronica Peters making a home visit to Alfred Mann. The Croydon unit cares for 500 vulnerable older people. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian\nBev Campbell, a social worker with the local council who helped develop the scheme, says the initiative was inspired by a conviction that early, preventative help at home would reduce the numbers of older people brought in by ambulance to accident and emergency at a later stage. She remembers one patient who staff saw at A&E over 100 times, who stopped attending once he was allocated a nurse to make regular visits to his home.\n\u201cHe was ringing up ambulances purely because of the loneliness; he would call up and say he felt dizzy. He acknowledged that he was calling because he was lonely. He just wanted someone to recognise that he needed help,\u201d Campbell said.\nMany of the 500 clients the team sees in Croydon live alone. According to Gill Vincent-Clayden, another health visitor: \u201cLoneliness is a major issue. They stop eating; it is such an effort to make a meal for one. They may begin to forget to look after themselves, stop washing themselves, changing their clothes; then they can get skin infections.\n\u201cA lot of our clients don\u2019t have anyone else. Most are well over 85, have lost a lot of friends; they are housebound and we are the only people they see.\u201d\nSometimes, although they have been living independently for years, their confidence takes a knock after a fall. \u201cThey start to be worried about going out. After that everything begins to fail; they don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about it,\u201d said Vincent-Clayden.\nPatients are often on a trolley, rather than a bed. They might be surrounded by alcoholics, drug addicts\nDr Nima Hashemi, head of the ACE unit at Croydon University hospital, said the introduction of the service in 2012 meant fewer older people having the unhappy experience of waiting for treatment at A&E. \u201cPatients are often on a trolley, rather than a bed, so may not be comfortable. They might be surrounded by alcoholics, drug addicts,\u201d he said.\nSince Hashemi\u2019s clinic opened, the hospital\u2019s A&E services have improved, because there are fewer older people with complex issues waiting there for medical help. The A&E department now sees at least 95% of its patients within four hours, up from 90% last year. The ACE unit, along with other initiatives designed to speed up the treatment of patients, has contributed to a fall in the number of hospital admissions by an average of 20 patients a day. Hashemi estimates that the the ACE unit\u2019s work has potentially saved over \u00a3500,000 during the course of a year, as a result of reduced pressure on A&E and fewer beds being occupied.\nRochdale has also seen some striking results. When the local clinical commissioning group (CCG) \u2013 one of the GP-led bodies that buy services to deliver much of what the NHS does \u2013 wanted to recommission community services in the area, the hospital trust and Rochdale council got together with organisations including a local social enterprise and Age UK Rochdale, and tendered to jointly run \u201cintermediate\u201d services, targeted at people not quite well enough to be at home without support, but who really don\u2019t need to be in hospital.\nIn September, the intermediate care tier service was launched, with the specific aim of reducing unnecessary hospital admissions and speeding up discharges. And by those measures it would already seem to be achieving dramatic results \u2013 surprising even those behind the scheme. In the four months to December, there were 864 fewer non-elective admissions to hospital in the Rochdale area than the previous year, a fall of more than 10%. In December, as the new system embedded, the reduction was 17.7%. The average length of stay in the two intermediate care units has fallen by 30% in one and 50% in the other.\nRochdale and Croydon are far from alone. A pilot integrated programme in Cornwall involving NHS providers, Cornwall council, Age UK and other voluntary groups, last year reported significant improvements in mental wellbeing and in feelings of loneliness among patients \u2013 and a 41% reduction in acute hospital costs. The charity is now rolling out the programme to other sites across the country.\nLast March, NHS England announced 29 \u201cvanguard\u201d sites from Northumberland to Devon, which have been actively charged with developing creative new models of integrated health and social care. Perhaps most ambitiously of all, in April the 10 city and borough councils that make up Greater Manchester (including Rochdale), along with 27 other CCGs and hospital trusts, will assume collective responsibility for the entire region\u2019s health and social care budgets \u2013 a \u00a36bn experiment that represents one of the most dramatic reorganisations in NHS history.\nCan integrating health and social care save the NHS? The challenges remain mind-boggling, but it is striking, if nothing else, that those involved on all sides \u2013 health providers, commissioners, local authorities and voluntary organisations \u2013 speak with enthusiasm and real optimism about what might be possible if only they can get it right.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T13:22:38", "author": "Esther Addley|Amelia Gentleman", "lang": "en", "topic": "Older people|This is the NHS|Social care|NHS|Health|Hospitals|features", "category": "UK|society", "title": "Don't give them a bed, give them a chair: a new twist on an age-old problem", "source": "guardian", "intro": "On the ward, elderly patients often quickly lose the ability to look after themselves.

Your focus on the vested interests of the food and drinks industries and their disastrous impact on the NHS begins to reveal where the government\u2019s loyalties lie, and I hope you will be exploring the involvement of the insurance and health businesses with politicians and NHS bosses in the coming days.\nA huge injection of funds is required with the utmost urgency, and has to come from central government, not by getting rid of vital staff as suggested by NHS England and Monitor (Hospitals told to shed staff as NHS funding crisis deepens, 30 January). I want to pay a hypothecated NHS income tax as soon as possible. I\u2019d like to see a freeze on any further procurements and a big reduction in the army of back office staff who are there just to marketise the NHS. If we could claw back some of that annual cost, put at around \u00a35bn, we\u2019d be able to deal with a lot of the debts and begin to get to grips with provision of social care.\nI also fear a big campaign to make people think the only answer is health insurance. How is it to be countered? Perhaps those considering taking that path should visit the website of Virginia Mason hospital, Jeremy Hunt\u2019s ideal health provider in Seattle, and look at the section on billing and insurance. It is a not-for-profit business but you still need the right insurance package to be eligible to join, and it\u2019s very complicated. A service that is both free at the point of use and properly funded through taxation is a much more efficient way of providing equitable, accessible and \u2013 as your series shows \u2013 mainly wonderful healthcare for everyone.\nSue Vaughan\nRetired GP, Little Melton, Norfolk\n\u2022 The government know that the key to their devious and subversive plot to privatise the NHS has to be to soften up the public to the idea. This started years ago, even before Andrew Lansley blocked the release of a report praising the service, and continues with the almost daily denigration of the quality of care.\nMuch of the media seem to collude with this. The latest example is how the tragic case of baby William Mead was reported. NHS 111 failed on several occasions. Nowhere was it said that NHS 111 has been privatised and is run by Care UK, whose one-time chairman \u2013 and his wife \u2013 donated to the Tory party and to Lansley\u2019s private office. It was portrayed purely as an \u201cNHS\u201d failure. Nor was it mentioned that Jeremy Hunt was warned years ago that NHS 111 was not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d, that its launch should be postponed and not rushed as it was, and that the downgrading of the call handlers from clinical to lay staff was dangerous.\nSimilarly, every time there is a nursing home scandal such as Winterbourne View, headlines warn of \u201cNHS failure\u201d, despite most of them being in private hands.\nThis is misleading the public to unfairly think the NHS is failing, when it is actually the privatised side that is letting down patients. The NHS is failing but only because of the lack of investment by this government \u2013 the lowest in the G7 \u2013 and the wasteful commercialisation.\nDr Paul Hobday\nHorsmonden, Kent\nThe case for matching the average western European GDP health expenditure 10.3% is overwhelming Professor Colin Pritchard\n\u2022 Based upon World Bank data, the proportion of UK national income (GDP) spent on health has fallen from a record high of 9.4% in 2010 to 9.1% by 2013.\nMargaret Thatcher rightly said \u201cwe can only have the services we can afford\u201d, but our research shows that we do not afford as much as most other western nations. For example, the fiscally prudent Germans spent 11.3% of GDP on health, the French 11.6% and the US 17.1%, and currently we are 18th out of 21 countries.\nHowever, despite comparative chronic underfunding of the NHS, our forthcoming research shows that, in reducing cancer deaths and adult mortality, the NHS achieves proportionately more with relatively less \u2013 but for how long can this be maintained?\nThe case for matching the average western European GDP health expenditure 10.3% is overwhelming. If the public realised the comparative truth about NHS funding then there would likely be support to match the Europeans, possibly even if it meant 2p on income tax.\nProfessor Colin Pritchard\nSouthampton\n\u2022 When 45% of wards in England operate at unsafe levels and district nurse numbers have dropped 27% over the past four years, it is dangerous that hospitals \u201care being asked to shed staff to rescue the NHS from an acute funding crisis\u201d. Instead, a \u201cfinancial rescue\u201d could come from two sources. The first is extremely simple. Cut a bigger slice of our GDP \u201ccake\u201d for healthcare. The second is for the government to buy out all private finance initiative schemes. Many hospitals are in deficit having to pay off PFI loans \u2013 \u00a3400m was spent to build Coventry\u2019s University hospital, but the cost of building it through PFI will be \u00a33.3bn. Overall, PFI deals have financed \u00a311.8bn in building hospitals in England but will cost \u00a379bn to pay back over 31 years, and the NHS spends more than \u00a33,700 every minute to pay for privately financed hospitals. So buying them out now, particularly as interest rates are low, could save many billions to reinvest in the NHS.\nDavid Murray\nWallington, Surrey\n\u2022 How could the Lib Dems in the coalition government have let the duty of the secretary of state for health to \u201cprovide\u201d a health service be changed to the duty to \u201cpromote\u201d a health service (Health and Social Care Act 2012)? What on earth were they thinking?

Meanwhile, a proposal from Norman Lamb and others, conveniently at arm\u2019s length from the government, asks to set up a commission to look at how to fund the NHS. His bill is hastily scheduled for a second reading on 11 March, the very same day as Caroline Lucas\u2019s private member\u2019s bill on the NHS, which would reinstate the secretary of state\u2019s duty to provide a service.\nPrivate member\u2019s bills are easily derailed.

Instead, they will again withdraw from providing all care except emergency services, such as A&E, maternity care, intensive care and emergency surgery.\nThousands of planned operations and outpatient clinics will be postponed, like they were in the first strike by many of the 45,000 junior doctors in England on 12 January.\nA source close to the talks said: \u201cJeremy Hunt\u2019s strategy now is to exhaust the junior doctors, hope that more of them turn up for work during next week\u2019s strike and hope that the industrial action fizzles out and then impose the contract in August.\u201d\nTalks that had been running since 1 December broke down, with both sides blaming what it portrayed as the other side\u2019s intransigence for the failure to reach an agreement over whether some or much of Saturday should become part of a junior doctor\u2019s normal working week.\nThe BMA angrily criticised what it said was ministers\u2019 unhelpfully \u201centrenched\u201d stance on Saturday working in the talks.\nDr Johann Malawana, the chair of the BMA\u2019s junior doctors committee, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s position \u2013 based on ideology rather than reason \u2013 risks souring relations with an entire generation of junior doctors, the very doctors who the secretary of state has acknowledged as the backbone of the NHS.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s entrenched position in refusing to recognise Saturday working as unsocial hours, together with its continued threat to impose a contract so fiercely resisted by junior doctors across England, leaves us with no alternative but to continue with industrial action.\u201d\nMalawana said that, despite two months of talks, \u201cwe have seen no willingness on their part to move on a core issue for junior doctors up and down the country\u201d.\nSir David Dalton, the chief executive of Salford Royal NHS foundation trust who Hunt recently appointed as the government\u2019s lead negotiator in the talks, agreed that Saturday was \u201cthe key area of difference\u201d preventing a settlement. But he claimed that the impasse was because the BMA had broken a previous pledge to negotiate on the issue.\nHe said it had promised to do so on 30 November, when the Advisory, Conciliation and Advisory Service (Acas) became involved, but had refused point blank to do so recently, Dalton said in a letter to Hunt updating him on progress. \u201cIt is very disappointing that the BMA continues to refuse to negotiate on the issues of unsocial hours payment,\u201d he said.\nThe normal working week for junior doctors, for which they receive basic pay, is from 7am to 7pm Monday to Friday.

While he and his wife were there preparing for the move, the state of Kansas took five of their children, ages 5 to 16, into custody on suspicion of child endangerment, ensnaring his family in interstate marijuana politics.\nCases like the Schwabs\u2019 have become a lightning rod for marijuana activists and have left courts, family attorneys and Child Protective Services (CPS) unsure of where the lines are drawn in this brave new world of legalized cannabis.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a stigma against parents who use medical marijuana,\u201d says Jennifer Ani, a family law attorney who says she sees around five similar cases a month \u2013 in 95% of which she believes the child was in no reasonable danger. \u201cAs much as marijuana is a moving target throughout the nation, with Child Protective Services it\u2019s even more so.\u201d\nShe says that concerns about contact-highs or children eating raw cannabis are often cited but are not scientifically sound arguments that a child is in danger. Contact-highs have been widely discredited as a myth, and cannabis must be cooked before it can get you high.\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment on the Schwab case but pointed us to their guide \u201cParental Drug Use As Child Abuse\u201d, which says that \u201cexposing children to the manufacture, possession, or distribution of illegal drugs is considered child endangerment in 11 States [including Kansas]\u201d and \u201cthe Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act requires states to have policies and procedures in place to notify child protective services agencies of substance-exposed newborns\u201d.\nA case like Schwab\u2019s has one foot in both the legal and illegal dynamics of marijuana, since his case involves Kansas, where cannabis remains illegal, and Colorado, where it is legal for both medical and recreational sale.\nTensions have been running high between Colorado and neighboring states whose residents want to purchase cannabis. Last year, sheriffs from Nebraska, Oklahoma and Kansas filed a lawsuit against the state for its marijuana laws, citing trafficking concerns; and this month, the Kansas attorney general sent out 500 surveys to their county and district attorneys, sheriffs and chiefs of police asking how Colorado marijuana is affecting their work.\nA US navy veteran who served in the Gulf war, Schwab says that he uses a homemade cannabis butter to treat his post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, and chronic pain. For years, he says, his mental health issues went undiagnosed, resulting in a bout of alcoholism and substance abuse. He was prescribed a variety of sedatives, antidepressants and chronic pain medication, which he says often made him feel worse. \u201cI got addicted to the pain medication, which led to heroin addiction.\u201d\nSchwab says that he has been sober since a stint in rehab in 2011, and that cannabis is the only medication that helps with his anxiety, depression and physical pain.\nSchwab arranged in early 2015 for his job at the Department of Veterans Affairs to be transferred from Kansas to Colorado, where he could legally grow his own cannabis and work with veterans who, like him, use the plant medicinally.\nWhile dealing with the move, he and Amelia arranged for the five children to stay with relatives. (The four youngest children were born to Raymond and his wife, Amelia; the 16-year-old and a 19-year-old who was not taken into custody are Amelia\u2019s children from previous relationships.) After driving 60 miles away from home, the Schwabs received a call saying they needed to appear in an emergency hearing that day because their children were in state custody.\nSchwab says that one of the relatives caring for his children (whom he declines to name) took them to the police station, saying their parents had abandoned them to go work on a pot farm in Colorado. That was in April last year, and Schwab says he has only seen his children three times since then.\nThe communications director for the Kansas department of children and families (DCF) declined to comment on the Schwab case but said that \u201cchildren are not removed from the home for [parental] marijuana use alone\u201d.\nYet Schwab says that no investigation was done of him or his home, and that the only evidence against him was the testimony of the police officer that took the children into custody. There were allegations of \u201cemotional abuse\u201d but a DCF report in July found those to be \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d.\nIncluded in the police report was a screenshot of Schwab\u2019s recent Facebook post, where he discusses moving to Colorado to start a marijuana business. The Schwabs have been asked to submit a urine sample that would be tested to see if they have used marijuana before they can visit their children \u2013 despite having relocated to Colorado, where he has a prescription.\nThe district attorney of Riley County, Kansas, where the Schwabs\u2019 case is currently being handled, did not return requests for an interview.\nAni says that it\u2019s not unusual to see children removed from their home for marijuana use, even in states where it\u2019s legal. In 2014 she defended a California couple whose children were taken by CPS after a police officer smelled marijuana in the house, despite having prescriptions for the substance. The additional charge against them was that their home was in disarray.\nLast year, Ani worked on the highly publicized Kansas case of Shona Banda, whose 11-year-old son was taken from her after he told his drug education program teacher that his mother used cannabis.\nFor cases like Schwab\u2019s, the legal spiderweb of cannabis law becomes compounded by his PTSD.\nDr Sue Sisley \u2013 a psychiatrist who recently received a $2m grant to study the effects of cannabis in treating PTSD, the first study of its kind \u2013 says that for vets like Schwab, \u201cthey need their medicine in order to be a good parent\u201d.\n\u201cA lot of these vets, they can\u2019t function without their meds. And they have to live in fear of a positive drug test, and losing their kids to Child Protective Services. So they live this crazy, covert lifestyle where they\u2019re afraid to be open to the people around them, for fear that they\u2019ll call CPS.\u201d\nLast month, Schwab testified before a Kansas state senate committee and, with tears in his eyes, pleaded for the state to \u201cgive me back my children\u201d.\nThe committee was considering a bill that aimed to lower criminal penalties for marijuana possession and allow hemp oil to be used medicinally \u2013 moves that he criticized for not going far enough.\nSchwab says that once he regains custody of his children he plans to sue the state of Kansas for violation of his constitutional rights. \u201cThey\u2019re holding my kids hostage and threatening to terminate my rights if I don\u2019t seek cannabis-abuse therapy in a state that\u2019s legal. They\u2019re threatening other people with jail time or losing their kids if they speak out, but I will not submit.

Her book, which follows her global warming report Field Notes from a Catastrophe (2006), is already set to become a contemporary classic, and an excellent place to start this new series of landmark nonfiction titles in the English language.\nThe 100 best nonfiction books of all time Read more\nOn the opening page of her investigation into the future of our planet, Kolbert quotes the great biologist EO Wilson: \u201cIf there is danger in the human trajectory, it is not so much in the survival of our own species as in the fulfilment of the ultimate irony of organic evolution: that in the instant of achieving self-understanding through the mind of man, life has doomed its most beautiful creations.\u201d This warning note sets the mood for the 13 chapters that follow, an urgent contemporary report on \u201cthe sixth extinction\u201d.\nKolbert\u2019s perspective is both awe-inspiring and fearsome, but utterly engrossing, as you\u2019d expect from a book whose premise is \u201cwe\u2019re all doomed\u201d. During the past half billion years, she tells us, there have been five mass extinctions on Earth, when \u201cthe planet has undergone change so wrenching that the diversity of life has plummeted\u201d.\nThe history of these catastrophic events, notes Kolbert, tends to be recaptured just as humanity comes to realise that it is about to cause another one. Sure enough, in our postmillennial century, she finds that scientists around the world are now monitoring the next mass extinction, possibly the biggest devastation since an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs. With this difference: the impending cataclysm is\u2026 us.\nPart of Kolbert\u2019s concern is to educate the modern reader in the history of mass extinction, a comparatively recent idea\nIn 13 emblematic episodes, exquisitely narrated, Kolbert, a magazine journalist with the New Yorker, explores the possibility of our impending doom through the lives of, for instance, the Panamanian golden frog, the Sumatran rhino and the black-faced honeycreeper of Maui, \u201cthe most beautiful bird in the world\u201d.\nPart of Kolbert\u2019s concern is to educate the modern reader in the history of mass extinction. While the concept, as she puts it, \u201cmay be the first scientific idea that kids have to grapple with\u201d, as they play with their toy dinosaurs, Kolbert instructs that, actually, it\u2019s a comparatively recent idea that dates to Enlightenment France. Until this moment in the western intellectual tradition, not even Aristotle (in his 10-volume History of Animals) had so much as considered the possibility that animals had a past. Later, in Roman times, Pliny\u2019s Natural History includes descriptions of animals that are real, or fabulous, but none that are extinct. The word \u201cfossil\u201d was used to describe anything dug from the ground, as in \u201cfossil fuel\u201d. Even Carl Linnaeus, who pioneered his system of binomial nomenclature in the mid-18th century, catalogued only one kind of animal \u2013 those that exist.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The black-faced honeycreeper from Maui \u2013 \u2018the most beautiful bird in the world\u2019. Photograph: Paul E Baker/USFWS\nIt was the discovery of some American mastodon bones in what is now Ohio, during the early 18th century \u2013 an unintended consequence of French colonial exploration \u2013 that subsequently inspired Georges Cuvier, an anatomist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, to ask the essential question: \u201cWhat was this primitive Earth? \u2026 And what revolution was able to wipe it out?\u201d\nRevolutionary France celebrated the rights of man. Cuvier was never going to recognise the truth about some later extinctions: that Homo sapiens is the problem, not the solution. Addressing the imminent next catastrophe with a certain grim relish, Kolbert spells out the results of her investigations: \u201cOne-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater molluscs, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed towards oblivion,\u201d she declares, during the course of her odyssey through our natural world and its human-inspired devastation. Kolbert\u2019s indictment of humanity is remorseless, and compelling: \u201cThe losses are occurring all over: in the South Pacific, in the North Atlantic, in the Arctic and in the Sahel, in lakes and on islands, on mountaintops and in valleys.\u201d\nHomo sapiens may have enjoyed brilliant success but we have done so at the expense of virtually every other species\nReaders of The Sixth Extinction will be unable to evade the conclusion that we do indeed find ourselves on the brink of a great catastrophe, one in which the agent involved is not an inanimate object (such as an asteroid) or a geophysical force (such as the extreme global warming disaster of 250m years ago) but a sentient creature: ourselves. Homo sapiens may have enjoyed brilliant success on Earth but we have done so at the expense of virtually every other species. We are, as the Observer\u2019s Robin McKie has put it, \u201cthe neighbours from hell\u201d.\nThe Sixth Extinction ends in a windowless room at the Institute for Conservation Research in California known as the Frozen Zoo, the world\u2019s largest collection of species on ice. This, suggests Kolbert, may be the slender thread on which life on Earth will depend in future. Who knows? She underlines her final message with a quotation from the Stanford ecologist Paul R Erhlich: \u201cIN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.\u201d\nWe have been warned.\nA signature line\n\u201cThe Sixth Extinction will continue to determine the course of life long after everything people have written and painted and built has been ground into dust and giant rats have \u2013 or have not \u2013 inherited the Earth.\u201d\nThree to compare\nEO Wilson: On Human Nature (1978)\nElizabeth Kolbert: Field Notes from a Catastrophe: A Frontline Report on Climate Change (2006)\nYuval Noah Harari: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (2014)", "date_time": "2016-02-01T05:45:19", "author": "Robert Mccrum", "lang": "en", "topic": "Science and nature|100 Best Nonfiction Books of All Time|Biodiversity|Wildlife|Conservation|Pollution|Climate change\n(Environment)|features", "category": "culture|books", "title": "The 100 best nonfiction books: No 1 - The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert (2014)", "source": "guardian", "intro": "The first in a new series on the world\u2019s most important works of nonfiction is an engrossing account of the looming catastrophe caused by ecology\u2019s \u2018neighbours from hell\u2019 \u2013 mankind"},

In last Thursday\u2019s debate, the last before tonight\u2019s Iowa caucus votes, on Fox News of all networks, there was one brief climate question directed at Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL). Unfortunately it was framed as a \u2018gotcha, flip-flop\u2019 question, with Rubio asked about his apparent support 8 years ago for a carbon cap and trade system in Florida, versus his current opposition to the concept. Rubio responded:\nI have never supported cap and trade and I never thought it was a good idea. And I was clear about that at the time. And I do not believe it\u2019s a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment. And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy. When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.\nIn another debate 4 months ago on CNN, Rubio made similar comments, adding:\nAmerica\u2019s a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, but America is not a planet. And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore, China is, and they are drilling a hole anywhere in the world that they can get ahold of.\nFact checking Marco Rubio\nPolitifact ruled it \u201cmostly true\u201d that Rubio never supported cap and trade. However, the rest of his comments are mostly false.\nFirst, \u201cblame China\u201d is no longer a viable option. Despite having much lower cumulative historical carbon emissions than the USA, China has agreed to take serious action to curb its coal consumption and carbon pollution, and has announced that it will launch the world\u2019s largest carbon cap and trade system. Using China to oppose an American carbon cap and trade system simply doesn\u2019t make sense.\nSecond, the \u201cour pollution is too small to matter\u201d argument is known as the Tragedy of the Commons fallacy. If the USA can make that argument, then so can every country. If every country uses this excuse, then none cut their carbon pollution, and climate destabilization becomes inevitable. The good news is that the opposite is already happening. Virtually every country in the world agreed to cut carbon pollution as a result of the Paris climate negotiations, including the United States and China.\nThird, there are already cap and trade systems in place in the United States. The George H.W. Bush administration invented the concept of cap and trade to tackle the problem of acid rain with an economically optimal, free market approach. Under that cap and trade system, emissions of the pollutants that were causing acid rain were cut more quickly and cheaply than expected, and the estimated economic benefits have outweighed the costs of the system 40-to-1.\nCalifornia and a collaboration of nine northeastern states also already have successful carbon cap and trade systems in place. In order to comply with proposed EPA carbon regulations, many more states are likely to implement carbon cap and trade systems, or join these existing networks.\nFourth, as these successful existing cap and trade systems demonstrate, the concept hasn\u2019t been devastating for the economy. Quite the opposite \u2013 the economies of the nine northeastern states, which implemented their regional cap and trade system in 2008, and of California, where it was introduced in 2013, have fared better than the national average. There is also a consensus among economic experts that we should cut carbon pollution, with most favoring a cap and trade system or carbon tax.\nIn fact, in a March 2007 speech, Rubio wisely argued that Florida should take advantage of the economic opportunities created by this type of free market solution.\nThis nation, and ultimately the world, is headed towards emission caps and energy diversification. Those changes will require technological advances that make those measures cost effective. The demand toward such advances will create an industry to meet it\u2014Florida should become the Silicon Valley of that industry.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marco Rubio carbon cap and trade speech in March 2007.\nUnfortunately there was no more debate about optimal climate policies last Thursday. Rubio rejected the possibility of a carbon cap and trade system, and the moderators moved on to another topic. However, the other Republican presidential candidates would likely have answered in a similar fashion. Governor Chris Christie pulled New Jersey out of the northeastern states carbon cap and trade system, Ted Cruz denies that the Earth is even warming, many of the candidates are science deniers, and the only Republican candidates who think we should take action to curb global warming (Lindsey Graham and George Pataki) have dropped out of the race.\nIdeology vs. Reality\nClimate change has sadly turned into an ideological litmus test. Republican candidates fear that if they admit human-caused global warming is a problem that we need to solve, they won\u2019t be able to win their party\u2019s nomination. As Graham and Pataki\u2019s candidacies showed, that may be true.\nHowever, a growing number of Republican thought leaders and even a majority of Republican voters support a revenue-neutral carbon tax. The problem is that while they represent a majority of the party, the conservative right wing of the party that imposes ideological purity tests dominates the primary election voting. This may be a flaw in the American political system, since the Republican Party now stands alone as the only climate-denying major political party in the world, and a candidate who can pass the right wing ideological purity test is unlikely to win a nationwide general election.\nIt\u2019s a problem that the Republican Party must solve, because we need them to participate in the climate policy debate. Their candidates\u2019 current strategy of denying the consensus of climate science and economics experts just won\u2019t cut it when the entire world is moving forward with efforts to solve the problem, taking advantage of the resulting economic opportunities that Rubio recognized eight years ago.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T11:00:02", "author": "Dana Nuccitelli", "lang": "en", "topic": "Climate change scepticism|Climate Consensus - the 97%|Climate change\n(Environment)|Carbon tax|COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris|Carbon offsetting|Global climate talks|blogposts", "category": "environment|climate change", "title": "Fox News Republican debate moderators asked a climate question!", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Dana Nuccitelli: Unfortunately, no climate policy debate ensued"},

Photograph: John Minchillo/AP\nTed Cruz fact check: which temperature data are the best? | Dana Nuccitelli Read more\nThat not all data indicates constant warming is one of the preferred arguments of Ted Cruz, who held a Senate hearing last month titled Data or Dogma.\nTo testify, Cruz called a retired Princeton physicist who believes the planet needs more carbon dioxide; a controversial climate scientist convinced of corruption in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); a climate scientist who insists basic models need reinvention; and a Canadian jazz vocalist who frequents the Rush Limbaugh Show and recorded an album about cats.\nWith the help of his witnesses and RSS satellite data since 1998, Cruz argued: \u201cThere has been no significant global warming for the past 18 years.\u201d\nBut the senator chose a very specific set of data: an extraordinary El Ni\u00f1o set record temperatures in 1998, and by the RSS metric global warming has slowed in the 18 years since. The result was a chart that began with a peak and spanned not quite two decades of slow warming.\nCarl Mears, the senior research scientist whose data Cruz used, told the Guardian that Cruz was guilty of the crime with which he charges scientists: presenting a very partial argument.\n\u201cHe ignores other time periods, and other types of data,\u201d said Mears, stressing surface temperatures \u201cthat do not support his hypothesis. He asserts that the satellite temperatures are more accurate than the surface temperature without providing any supporting evidence.\u201d\nDespite his own work with satellite data sets, Mears said he suspects surface data sets are more accurate.\n\u201cI agree with Mr Cruz that policy should follow science and data,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is important to follow all the data, not just the part that supports one side of the argument.\u201d\nA partial picture\nRubio has also spoken of the \u201chiatus\u201d, which Mears and others are studying and which remains only part of the picture. Last year was the hottest on record by far, smashing a record set only a year earlier.\nA witness called by Democrats to Cruz\u2019s Senate hearing, David Titley, a Penn State meteorologist and former navy admiral, rebuffed Cruz. Titley noted that science by definition contains error and revision \u2013 demonstrated, for instance, by the corrections made to satellite data produced by his fellow witnesses.\nHe also showed a clear curve of rising temperatures and carbon dioxide levels since 1880.\n\u201cThere are plenty of other signs that are far less equivocal, and perhaps even more relevant to those of us who live on the Earth\u2019s surface,\u201d he said. \u201cLand and ocean surface temperatures are increasing, sea ice is declining, glaciers are shrinking, oceans are rising, the list goes on.\u201d\nCruz mentioned a ship that got stuck in ice around Antarctica, arguing that the polar ice caps are not melting.\nCharles Bentley, an expert on Antarctica at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told the Guardian that sea ice floats.\n\u201cIf someone says sea ice in the same sentence as related to sea level change, a red flag goes up.\u201d\nBentley called the argument \u201ca little bit misleading\u201d, because sea ice, although an indirect sign of change around the poles, \u201cdoesn\u2019t directly indicate anything\u201d. Cruz\u2019s argument also ignores the clear melting of ice and glaciers on and around the north pole, where Russia, Canada and the US are competing over newly open ocean.\n\u2018Destroying the economy\u2019\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest US secretary of state John Kerry delivers a speech at the World Climate Change Conference 2015, in Paris.

She was one of the few surviving members of Lt Gen Sir Frederick Morgan\u2019s staff charged in 1943-44 with planning the invasion of north-west Europe.\nGinge was born in Swansea, south Wales. Her mother, Eleanor, died in childbirth and her father, Bill, a teacher, when she was 13. She left school at 14 and took a course at secretarial college. Her first job was in Swansea\u2019s Guildhall as the town clerk\u2019s secretary.\nIn 1943 she volunteered to join the Wrens as a shorthand typist. She was spotted by Morgan who, as chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (Designate), was planning Operation Overlord. Until March 1944, she was his shorthand typist and secretary. It was secret and hard work: \u201cI used to go to sleep singing songs in shorthand.\u201d The discretion and sense of duty that Morgan identified were valued qualities throughout her life; so too were dedication and loyalty.\nIn 1944 Morgan was appointed deputy chief of staff to General Dwight D Eisenhower. To his regret he was unable to take Ginge with him and she returned to the Navy. He wrote to Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, the allied naval commander: \u201cI should like you to know that in my experience, which is not small, I consider the work of Wren Thomas to be of the first order \u2026 Were she in my service, I should have no hesitation in recommending her for promotion and for commissioned rank.\u201d\nGinge had the satisfaction of seeing the plans she knew all about being implemented. She accompanied Ramsay to France and Germany in September 1944: \u201cWe had typed about it hundreds of times, but were now seeing it for the first time.\u201d Ginge was awarded the British Empire Medal in 1946. In the same year, she married Clark Thomas, one of the Desert Rats who fought in North Africa, and they went on to have two sons, Michael and Steven.\nAll who encountered Ginge at the University College of Swansea shared Morgan\u2019s view of her. Professor Sir Glanmor Williams wrote of the secretary he appointed in 1960 to the history department: \u201cGinge proved to be indispensable to staff and students alike \u2026 Over all the years we worked together \u2013 a quarter of a century \u2212 I found her an absolute treasure to whom I owed an incalculable debt.\u201d Her standing among the university\u2019s secretarial staff made her an obvious choice as secretary of the university branch of the Nalgo union. Her experience, determination and firm reasonableness ensured that the status of the university\u2019s secretarial staff improved.\nAfter retirement in 1984, Ginge devoted herself to family, friends and her church. Clark died in 2008 and Michael in 2009.

{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/terry-wogan-irish-troubles-prejudice-britain", "content": "In the flood of tributes to Terry Wogan, many of the late broadcaster\u2019s enduring qualities have been remembered: his seemingly indestructible niceness, his mischievous wit, his relaxed professionalism at the microphone, his gift of connection with his listeners. The front pages of the Sun and the Daily Mirror today summed them up: \u201cThank you for being our friend.\u201d\nYet, with the occasional exception, few of the British tributes lingered long, or at all, on what was surely one of Wogan\u2019s most interesting other qualities \u2013 his Irishness. Perhaps this was so obvious as not to require comment or deconstruction by his legions of British admirers. Yet it was an odd omission, given the scale of the tributes, and it was not one that was missed in Ireland itself, where the president, Michael D Higgins, and the prime minister, Enda Kenny, were quick to celebrate the Limerick-born broadcaster\u2019s role as \u201ca bridge between Britain and Ireland\u201d, as Kenny put it.\nSir Terry Wogan: tributes to BBC broadcaster dead aged 77 - as they happened Read more\nWogan rarely drew explicit attention to his Irishness. And yet, although he lived, worked and died in Britain, was knighted by the Queen, and was never reluctant to wave the union jack when the needs of the BBC required it, his Irishness was there whenever he opened his mouth. For more than 40 years he was probably the most prominent Irish person, and certainly the most familiar Irish voice, in Britain, rivalled for fame only by George Best and Bono, neither of whom could match Wogan\u2019s length of time in the spotlight.\nYet those four decades coincided with some of the darkest of times in the British-Irish relationship. They were the years of the Northern Ireland Troubles, of internment, of the Provisional IRA\u2019s bombing campaigns and of Britain\u2019s first anti-terrorism laws of the modern era, directed explicitly against Irish republicans.\nThey were also years in which anti-Irish prejudice in Britain was often not far from the surface, especially while Wogan was beginning to make his name.\nSo, whether he liked it or not, Wogan was a significant Irish presence in Britain right through the era of Gerry Adams and Ian Paisley. To some Irish nationalist eyes that may perhaps brand him as someone who made dubious accommodations with Britishness at a sensitive time. To his British listeners, however, and possibly to many of his Irish ones too, Wogan was a reminder that there was also much more to the British-Irish relationship than nationalist and loyalist politics, and that people on both sides of the Irish Sea have more in common than some of them sometimes like to pretend.\nIn this respect, Wogan was of course a prominent part of a long and continuing tradition. The old crack that says Britain gave Ireland its language and that in return Ireland gave Britain its literature may be false in many ways, yet remains absolutely true in others.\nBut Ireland, north and south, has also given Britain many of its most familiar microphone voices too, from This Is Your Life\u2019s Eamonn Andrews and chatshow host Graham Norton to sports commentators Peter O\u2019Sullevan and Alan Green.\nNot all great Irish broadcasters are lured to Britain, of course, as the career of Gay Byrne exemplifies above all others. Yet it is hard to think of one who reached across the political and cultural barriers to the extent that Wogan did.\nTo reflect on Wogan\u2019s Irishness is neither to extol nor exaggerate his influence. However popular Wogan may have been, and however much he may have been a kind of cultural bridge \u2013 even a very important one \u2013 it would be hard to argue that he changed the British-Irish relationship in any significant way. What he did, perhaps, was to use his personality to ensure the relationship didn\u2019t get worse at a time that it could easily have done so.\nWogan was indeed \u201cour\u201d friend. Like all those whose lives and examples strengthen friendships across divisive borders, he deserves honour and praise.\nThe terrible beauty of the Easter Rising remains alive today | Fintan O\u2019Toole Read more\nBut sentimentality on this count at least is out of place. Ignorance about Ireland remains appallingly widespread at the time of Wogan\u2019s death. A general election is expected to be announced in the Irish Republic tomorrow, but it will be largely neglected in Britain.\nThe centenary of the Easter Rising in April has generated little interest on this side of the Irish Sea, even though, as Fintan O\u2019Toole wrote in the Guardian today, it was a foundation event not only of modern Ireland but also of a United Kingdom that sometimes feels close to collapse.\nThere are no firm plans yet for RTE\u2019s new drama series Rebellion, set at the time of the Easter Rising, to be shown in the UK.

{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/gay-cake-row-i-changed-my-mind-ashers-bakery-freedom-of-conscience-religion", "content": "Like most gay and equality campaigners, I initially condemned the Christian-run Ashers Bakery in Belfast over its refusal to produce a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan for a gay customer, Gareth Lee. I supported his legal claim against Ashers and the subsequent verdict \u2013 the bakery was found guilty of discrimination last year. Now, two days before the case goes to appeal, I have changed my mind. Much as I wish to defend the gay community, I also want to defend freedom of conscience, expression and religion.\nThe saga began in 2014 when the bakery said it was not willing to ice a cake with the words \u201csupport gay marriage\u201d and the logo of the equality group Queer Space, claiming the message was contrary to its Christian beliefs. This struck many of us as anti-gay discrimination based on religious-inspired homophobic prejudice. Ashers believes that the relationships of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people are wrong and should not be eligible for the status of marriage. They translated these beliefs into action and declined to make the cake. Ashers would have decorated a cake with a message celebrating traditional heterosexual marriage and promoting a Christian organisation. Surely this was an example of clear-cut anti-gay discrimination?\nThe \u2018gay cake\u2019 ruling is a victory for equality in Northern Ireland | Joshua Rozenberg Read more\nGareth Lee\u2019s legal case against Ashers was backed by the Equality Commission of Northern Ireland. It argued that the bakery\u2019s actions breached Northern Ireland\u2019s Equality Act and Fair Employment and Treatment Order, which prohibit discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services on the respective grounds of sexual orientation and political opinion. Last May a Belfast court found Ashers guilty of discrimination on both grounds, ordering it to pay Lee \u00a3500 compensation.\nI profoundly disagree with Ashers\u2019 opposition to same-sex love and marriage, and support protests against them. They claim to be Christians, yet Jesus never once condemned homosexuality, and discrimination is not a Christian value. Ashers\u2019 religious justifications are, to my mind, theologically unsound. Nevertheless, on reflection the court was wrong to penalise Ashers and I was wrong to endorse its decision.\nThe law suit against the bakery was well-intended. It sought to challenge homophobia. But it was a step too far. It pains me to say this, as a long-time supporter of the struggle for LGBT equality in Northern Ireland, where same-sex marriage and gay blood donors remain banned. The equality laws are intended to protect people against discrimination. A business providing a public service has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on race, gender, faith and sexuality.\nHowever, the court erred by ruling that Lee was discriminated against because of his sexual orientation and political opinions.\nThe Ashers verdict could encourage far-right extremists to demand the promotion of anti-migrant and anti-Muslim opinions\nHis cake request was refused not because he was gay, but because of the message he asked for. There is no evidence that his sexuality was the reason Ashers declined his order. Despite this, Judge Isobel Brownlie said that refusing the pro-gay marriage slogan was unlawful indirect sexual orientation discrimination. On the question of political discrimination, the judge said Ashers had denied Lee service based on his request for a message supporting same-sex marriage. She noted: \u201cIf the plaintiff had ordered a cake with the words \u2018support marriage\u2019 or \u2018support heterosexual marriage\u2019 I have no doubt that such a cake would have been provided.\u201d Brownlie thus concluded that by refusing to provide a cake with a pro-gay marriage wording Ashers had treated him less favourably, contrary to the law.\nThis finding of political discrimination against Lee sets a worrying precedent. Northern Ireland\u2019s laws against discrimination on the grounds of political opinion were framed in the context of decades of conflict. They were designed to heal the sectarian divide by preventing the denial of jobs, housing and services to people because of their politics. There was never an intention that this law should compel people to promote political ideas with which they disagreed.\nGay cake row: why minority views matter | Letters Read more\nThe judge concluded that service providers are required to facilitate any \u201clawful\u201d message, even if they have a conscientious objection. This raises the question: should Muslim printers be obliged to publish cartoons of Mohammed? Or Jewish ones publish the words of a Holocaust denier? Or gay bakers accept orders for cakes with homophobic slurs? If the Ashers verdict stands it could, for example, encourage far-right extremists to demand that bakeries and other service providers facilitate the promotion of anti-migrant and anti-Muslim opinions. It would leave businesses unable to refuse to decorate cakes or print posters with bigoted messages.\nIn my view, it is an infringement of freedom to require businesses to aid the promotion of ideas to which they conscientiously object.

Mind games have long been among his trademark skills in contrast to Stuart Lancaster and Martin Johnson who preferred to respect their next opponents to death. On Monday, for example, Jones even offered to write to his opposite number, Vern Cotter, to apologise for suggesting the hosts should be favourites. \u201cI know he was upset about that so I apologise to Vern. If you want me to write a letter, I\u2019ll write a letter of apology. We\u2019re happy to be favourites.

I don\u2019t see that as mind games, it\u2019s just part of the process. I think it is an important part of the game. Warren Gatland does it exceedingly well, doesn\u2019t he?

Before most Calcutta Cup encounters the auld enemy rhetoric tends to swirl as thickly as winter mist across a Highland grouse moor. Not this year. \u201cWe know how much the jersey means to the Scottish people but you can\u2019t go on to the field thinking that,\u201d Laidlaw says, flatly. \u201cIt really did feel as if that\u2019s why we played a lot better during the World Cup.\u201d\nSix Nations preview: the bold will be rewarded in era of new beginnings | Eddie Butler Read more\nHang on, can that be right? A Scotland team at Murrayfield actively trying to block out the pipers, the kilted bandsmen and the traditional \u201chomeward tae think again\u201d exhortations? With a Six Nations championship kicking off shortly something really must be up. At this rate the hosts will be serving crustless cucumber sandwiches in the press box and asking tenderly after Will Carling\u2019s health.\nEven Laidlaw, a proud son of Jedburgh, is currently resident in Cheltenham: the \u201cCotswolds Braveheart\u201d does not have quite the same intimidatory zing. Peek beyond the ancient cultural rivalry and neighbourly banter and a much more worrying prospect awaits the visitors: a Scotland squad quietly convinced they will not just sneak home this Saturday on a gale of passion and emotion but beat the English at their own, cool-headed game.\nFor not since David Sole\u2019s famously slow walk on to the field in 1990 have Scotland been so deliberately calm and \u2013 whisper it \u2013 optimistic. As Laidlaw confirms, their World Cup efforts have given Scottish rugby the inner confidence it has lacked for too long. The tournament may have ended painfully, with the fleet-footed Craig Joubert\u2019s infamous late refereeing decision allowing Australia to escape in a riveting quarter-final at Twickenham, but it has removed the inferiority complex built up by eight years of Calcutta Cup frustration.\n\u201cIt is a good place to be,\u201d says Laidlaw, who detects a direct link between Scotland\u2019s improvement and not allowing a tartan haze of national fervour to cloud their focus. \u201cWe want to go down that same route again because we felt we got a lot of payoff from it. There\u2019s always baggage but there are no preconceptions. I don\u2019t like saying: \u2018We\u2019ve got nothing to lose\u2019 because you\u2019re playing for Scotland. There are always things to lose; you\u2019ve just got to be smarter in the way you go about it.\u201d\nThe 30-year-old Laidlaw, so often Scotland\u2019s tactical ringmaster, admits he learned this lesson the hard way. Last time England were in Edinburgh two years ago Scotland lost a soulless contest 20-0, only the second time since 1921 they had failed to muster any points against England at home. The then Scotland coach, Scott Johnson, openly criticised his \u201cnaive\u201d decision-makers while a stone-faced Laidlaw, his key playmaking lieutenant, was sitting alongside him.\nThat gruesome memory has not entirely faded, even on a breezy morning at Gloucester\u2019s Hartpury College base. \u201cI captained that day and, personally, it was one of my worst games for Scotland,\u201d Laidlaw acknowledges. \u201cWe probably overdid a few things beforehand and we were almost paralysed by emotion. That\u2019s where we got the balance right during the World Cup. You\u2019ve simply got to concentrate on putting big energy into your performance. I think I did that during the World Cup and played some of my best rugby. I\u2019ll be trying to use that template again but it\u2019s not easy when you run out in front of a 67,000 sellout Murrayfield crowd.\u201d\nHence the determination of Vern Cotter and his players to concentrate instead on fulfilling their potential. Given they have never finished higher than third in the Six Nations and have won only once on the opening weekend since 2000, this may sound a relative aim but in Johnny Gray, WP Nel, John Hardie, Josh Strauss, Finn Russell, Stuart Hogg and Mark Bennett \u2013 if fit \u2013 Scotland are gathering a bristling clan. They are also keen to prove the World Cup, not least the three-try quarter-final salvo against the Wallabies, was no fluke.\n\u201cHaving had that frustration last time we wore the jersey we want to have some positive feelings again,\u201d Laidlaw, nominated for the 2015 World Rugby player-of-the-year award for his role in Scotland\u2019s resurgence, murmurs.\nWith a settled spine to the side \u2013 \u201cthat consistency goes a long way towards helping the team and the coaches\u201d \u2013 his squad also have the benefit of kicking off the tournament at home for the first time since 2012. Eddie Jones\u2019s portrayal of England as underdogs, reckons Laidlaw, may just help fuel the fires, too: \u201cWe\u2019re buoyed we\u2019re at home. Expectation is high but you\u2019ve got to see that as a positive. We played well in the World Cup but we\u2019ve also got to understand nothing is going to come easy. No one\u2019s going to give us any favours.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A dejected Greig Laidlaw reflects on the defeat to Australia at the World Cup. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA\nHe is too modest to add that Scotland also have another potential advantage: their crafty, versatile captain. Laidlaw is set to draw level this weekend with his uncle, Roy, on 47 caps; the equally tenacious Gary Armstong, another Borders legend, is also now within sight on 51. If Laidlaw leads Scotland in all five championship games he will also overhaul Sole as his country\u2019s most-decorated captain. Not bad for a player who did not make his debut for Scotland until he was 25 and weighs barely 12 and a half stone.\nFor the same small Borders town \u2013 population 4,000 \u2013 to produce three such eminent Scotland internationals may not be entirely coincidental. While in Cheltenham Laidlaw has a photo of Riverside Park, home of Jed-Forest RFC, both to remind him of his roots and to give him daily inspiration. \u201cI\u2019m hugely proud of where I come from and the people I represent back in Jed. When you grow up in a small town you realise what it means to the people. I\u2019m the third scrum-half and the third captain of Scotland from Jed. That\u2019s unique. You don\u2019t want to let those individuals down, never mind the whole town. How would I describe the people? Tough, uncompromising, pretty honest. It\u2019s always good to go back. You\u2019re treated the same, which is the great thing about the town. They\u2019ll tell you what they think. Whether it be good or bad it never goes unnoticed.\u201d\nThe trick now is to emulate some of the success enjoyed by uncle Roy, one half of Scotland\u2019s greatest half-back partnership with John Rutherford. The former once joked he would be sent to a taxidermist when he died, so often did Bill McLaren compare his burrowing style to a Border terrier, a ferret or \u201ca well-nourished mole\u201d. He also recalls young Greig, aged only five, kicking a ball over the local club\u2019s main stand but Laidlaw Jr insists he is still down the family pecking order. \u201cForty-seven caps in his day was probably worth a hell of a lot more. It\u2019s difficult to compare but he also played in a successful period for Scotland and won a grand slam. To win something for Scotland is far more important than counting your caps. It\u2019s about what you do during your caps rather than the number you get.\u201d\nEddie Jones is happy for England to be labelled arrogant Read more\nDespite the proud tradition a small part of him hopes his young son, Ruary, will choose another sport. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough game. You get a lot of bangs and head knocks \u2013 is it going to get better or worse? I don\u2019t know and nobody really knows. It\u2019s relentless week in, week out and it isn\u2019t doing your body a great deal of good. Sometimes, especially this season off the back of a World Cup, it\u2019s absolutely manic. I love the game \u2013 and if my son wants to play it I\u2019m not going to discourage him \u2013 but if he wants to play golf or tennis I\u2019d certainly usher him towards that first.\u201d\nIn a perfect world he would also prefer fewer scrum penalties \u2013 \u201cpeople come to watch rugby, they don\u2019t come to watch penalties\u201d \u2013 and a global season. \u201cEventually it might have to happen because New Zealand and Australian players have a huge advantage over us. They come off the back of that World Cup and have three months off. We\u2019re straight into the season, then a summer tour. It is relentless.\n\u201cSummer rugby would be a big decision but it might even help Scotland. Playing in better weather at, say, Jed-Forest or Hawick \u2013 you could get people along on a nice Saturday afternoon, put on a barbie afterwards and suddenly a bit of community comes back into the club. It would certainly help the standard of the game in this part of the world, in my opinion.\u201d\nFor the moment, though, it is the wintry ambush of England that consumes this sharpest of rugby brains. Scotland have been plotting for weeks, while Jones is still learning his players\u2019 names.\nLaidlaw says the anger and disappointment of losing to Australia will never disappear completely but suspects Cotter will barely mention it this week.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never get that [Wallaby] game back, so you can\u2019t keep looking for excuses and asking people to feel sorry for you.\n\u201cYou look forward and the next time you wear the jersey you try to win and put a bit more history into it.

In the event the Wasps director of rugby\u2019s faith in his squad was more than justified, especially during a first half throughout which every one of his players out-performed his opposite number to a degree which left the home crowd genuinely nonplussed, and gives Saints\u2019 director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, serious cause for concern. Particularly worrying must have been the inability of his players to react to the unfolding situation, and Tom Wood, captain on the night, was not exaggerating in calling the performance a \u201cdisaster\u201d. Saints have been grinding out results this season, particularly at home where their defence has been, or at least had been, solid, but their attacking options are looking increasingly limited.

The change has come about since the arrival of Aaron Mauger as head coach. The former All Black fostered an approach that sees the ball moved when space is there to be opened up and kicked when it is not, principles that helped New Zealand win the last two World Cups. The Premiership, with a couple of exceptions, was a tournament where territory was king and where what Eddie Jones called sequence play was the fashion, but Leicester were comfortable with and without possession against Gloucester, waiting for the right moment. It is what Jones is looking to instil in his England players and teams like Northampton and Bath, who have built their games around what they do when in possession, are struggling to keep up. Paul Rees\n3) Goode might have the last laugh\nWhile Saracens are cruising clear at the top of the table, pulling Exeter along with them, things are far closer at the foot of the Premiership. Away wins for the three sides nervously contemplating life in the Championship next season are at such a high premium that home form is crucial and so on the same day that Worcester, who travel to London Irish on Sunday, went toe to toe with the Chiefs for large spells and left with nothing, Newcastle came from behind to clinch an invaluable win over Harlequins at Kingston Park and climb off the bottom of the table. Andy Goode\u2019s physique has always been the source of amusement in the stands but his talent was never in doubt. His decision to come out of retirement and join Newcastle inevitably prompted a few chuckles but his ability has evidently not diminished and judging by his nerveless kicking performance against Quins nor has his relish for the occasion. His signing by Dean Richards may just prove a masterstroke. Gerard Meagher\n4) Hill states case for England call-up on return for Chiefs\nEddie Jones\u2019s 23-man squad raised a few eyebrows last week, not least for his decision to pick Ollie Devoto and release Elliot Daly. On one hand the decision makes sense; Devoto covers both centre positions (not to mention a couple of others) whereas Daly does not cover 12, but such thinking does not chime with the southern hemisphere sides\u2019 willingness to pick specialists on the bench who can adapt if needs be. But If Devoto is there as the next available 12, after Owen Farrell, then we can at least assume that Sam Hill would be if not just returning from injury. His cameo against Worcester was impressive, making some piercing runs while showing an awareness of what was outside him. With Hill picked by Jones as cover for Henry Slade and Devoto in for Manu Tuilagi, it is reasonable to infer that Hill is above Devoto in the pecking order by virtue of Slade having no chance of playing in the Six Nations; Tuilagi has some chance, albeit diminished by a new hamstring injury. Hill will be back at Exeter on Sunday and will probably start against Saracens but do not be surprised to see him feature for England in the coming weeks. GM\n5) Back to the drawing board for Bath\nEight months on from the Premiership final that these two contested last season, Saracens, the champions, sit two points clear at the top of the table after beating Bath again. The 19-13 score line scarcely tells the tale of a match in which heroic defence by the visitors kept Saracens pointless at half-time. It was Bath though who failed to score any points after the break and went on to lose their fifth game on the bounce in all competitions. While this match was played without any of their England internationals, no one in their set-up would have expected them to be languishing ninth in the table after the promise of last season. Since the beginning of November they have won only four times in 12 games domestically and in Europe. Next up are Gloucester at home on Friday night, a team who Bath have not lost to in the league since 2012.

The gelding will be one of two possible runners for O\u2019Neill in the Aintree race, for which entries will close at noon on Tuesday.\n\u201cHe\u2019s in grand form,\u201d O\u2019Neill said of Shutthefrontdoor, who has not been seen in public for more than two months. \u201cHe ran well in a hurdle race at Liverpool in November but then the ground got really heavy and he wants good ground.\n\u201cWhen he gets pulled around on heavy, he\u2019s not the easiest horse to keep right. I wanted to run him at Sandown this weekend but when I saw it was heavy, I thought I won\u2019t even enter him.\n\u201cIf you were a jockey, he\u2019d be the sort of horse you\u2019d look forward to riding in the National. He jumps really well.\u201d\nStamina is the issue for Shutthefrontdoor, as his trainer readily concedes. Carrying AP McCoy in the jockey\u2019s final National last year, the horse was in contention before tiring from the second-last.\n\u201cFor me, he just didn\u2019t get home,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cBut then he didn\u2019t have a run beforehand. I wanted to get one into him but it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\nAnd so, in the interests of putting a sharper edge on Shutthefrontdoor before 9 April, O\u2019Neill is hoping to give him \u201cone or two\u201d runs, ground permitting. But he also hopes the horse\u2019s cause might be helped by a \u201cmore professional\u201d display at Aintree this time, he having been rather free through the early stages last year.\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s other National entry will be Holywell, although the trainer is feeling rather nonplussed about this one after a \u201cvery disappointing\u201d display when pulled up at Doncaster on Saturday. \u201cHe didn\u2019t go a yard, the little monkey. We\u2019ll enter him and see how he goes between now and then.\u201d\nHolywell has an established pattern of moderate form in midwinter followed by much better efforts in the spring, usually at Cheltenham, and O\u2019Neill said he would probably be entered in the Gold Cup, in which he was a game fourth last year. \u201cBut he\u2019s not good enough, really.\u201d\nSmad Place, such an impressive winner at Cheltenham on Saturday, will not be tackling the Grand National, despite being quoted by a couple of firms. \u201cHis owners are not really Grand National people and I respect that,\u201d said his trainer, Alan King, who added that the Gold Cup-bound grey \u201cseems absolutely fine\u201d after beating Many Clouds by 12 lengths in the Betbright Trial.\nGrand National start time moved to 5.15pm in attempt to boost TV audience Read more\nKing\u2019s only National entrant is likely to be Midnight Prayer, a winner over four miles at the 2014 Festival, when he was a novice. \u201cThe only thing is, he\u2019d be borderline for making the cut at the bottom of the weights,\u201d the trainer said. \u201cHe\u2019ll run in a veterans\u2019 chase at Exeter on the 14th and hopefully do well enough to go up a few pounds.\u201d\nSmad Place may be missing when the National entries are revealed on Wednesday but his fellow Gold Cup contender Don Poli will be on the list, being one of six horses that Willie Mullins expects to put in the race. The others are On His Own, Sir Des Champs, Ballycasey, Turban and Valseur Lido.\nPressed on which of those were more likely to turn up on the day, the champion Irish trainer said all six were \u201cjust entries at this stage\u201d. In similar vein, he has five horses in Saturday\u2019s big race, the Scilly Isles Novice Chase at Sandown, but has yet to begin the process of choosing which of them should actually travel.", "date_time": "2016-02-01T19:10:36", "author": "Chris Cook", "lang": "en", "topic": "Grand National 2016|Grand National|Horse racing|news", "category": "sport|racing", "title": "Grand National hope Shutthefrontdoor keeps Jonjo O\u2019Neill vigilant", "source": "guardian", "intro": "Jonjo O\u2019Neill was anxious to find good ground to prepare Shutthefrontdoor to improve on last year\u2019s Aintree fifth place"},
