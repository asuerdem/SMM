            "President Xi Jinping said Tuesday that the Chinese People's "
            'Liberation Army (PLA) is moving rapidly toward "strong" '
            'informationized armed forces.\n'
            'Xi said the PLA has transformed from a "millet plus rifles" '
            'single-service force to one that has fully-fledged services and '
            'has basically completed mechanization.\n'
            'He said that the PLA must be bold in reform and adept in '
            'innovation while staying away from rigidity and stagnation at any '
            'time and under any circumstances.\n'
            "Xi reaffirmed the Communist Party of China (CPC)'s absolute "
            'leadership over the PLA.\n'
            '"To build a strong military, [we] must unswervingly adhere to the '
            "Party's absolute leadership over the armed forces, and make sure "
            'that the people\'s army always follow the Party," he said.\n'
            'Xi called for a new generation of "capable, brave and virtuous" '
            'army "with souls" in order to build a strong military.\n'
            'Calling political work the "lifeline" of the PLA, Xi said troops '
            'must have ironclad faith, beliefs, disciplines and '
            'responsibilities, and retain their nature and tenet as the '
            "people's army.\n"
            "Xi has urged the country's armed forces to bear in mind the "
            'sacred duty of fighting for the people.\n'
            'The PLA is deeply rooted in the people and the strength comes '
            'from the people, said Xi.\n'
            'Xi called on the PLA to maintain its close relationship with the '
            'people and "go through thick and thin" with them.\n'
            'The PLA should also actively contribute to the economic and '
            'social development in stationed areas to benefit the people with '
            'actions, said Xi.\n'
            'Xi urged boosting integrated military and civilian development '
            'amid efforts to build a strong military.\n'
            'China must build a national strategic system and capacity of '
            'military-civilian integration, he said.\n'
            'The CPC has established its thoughts on building a strong '
            'military in a new phase, Xi said.\n'
            'The Party has put forward a series of new ideas and requirements '
            'concerning national defense and military building in the past '
            'five years since the 18th CPC National Congress, which together '
            "constitute the CPC's thoughts on building a strong army in the "
            'new phase, Xi said.\n'
            "The Party's military strengthening theories should be constantly "
            'enriched and developed to cope with new challenges and solve new '
            'problems under new circumstances, he said.\n'
            'He stressed "coordinated, balanced and inclusive development" of '
            'economic and national defense construction.\n'
            'China will never compromise on its sovereignty, security or '
            'development interests, Xi said.\n'
            '"The Chinese people love peace. We will never seek aggression or '
            'expansion, but we have the confidence to defeat all invasions. We '
            'will never allow any people, organization or political party to '
            'split any part of Chinese territory out of the country at any '
            'time, in any form," Xi said.\n'
            '"No one should expect us to swallow the bitter fruit that is '
            'harmful to our sovereignty, security or development interests," '

            'the Central Military Commission, addresses the opening session of '
            'a workshop in Beijing, capital of China. A workshop for '
            'provincial and ministerial officials was held from Wednesday to '
            'Thursday in preparation for the 19th National Congress of the '
            'CPC. (Xinhua/Ma Zhancheng)\n'
            "BEIJING, July 28 -- Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech at a "
            'high-level workshop has sent a strong signal that the country '
            'will stick to and develop socialism with Chinese '
            'characteristics.\n'
            'The workshop gathered provincial and ministerial-level officials '
            'and was a significant meeting in preparation for the 19th '
            'Communist Party of China (CPC) National Congress to be held later '
            'this year. The congress will elect the leadership for the next '
            "five-year term. Thus Xi's speech at the workshop is regarded as "
            'setting the tone for the political, ideological and theoretical '
            'foundations of the congress.\n'
            'Xi said that socialism with Chinese characteristics had been the '
            "theme of all the Party's theories and practices since the reform "
            'and opening up in 1978.\n'
            'There is every reason to be confident as great achievements have '
            'been made over the past four decades. Last year, China '
            'contributed about 15 percent of global GDP, and GDP per capita '
            'reached 53,980 yuan (8,011 U.S. dollars).\n'
            'Developments over the past five years were especially '
            'extraordinary in terms of implementing the new concept of '
            'development, deepening reform, enhancing the rule of law, '
            'improving the environment and building a strong military.\n'
            'The major achievements mean that after experiencing century-long '
            'tribulations and hardships, China has made a historic leap from '
            'standing-up to becoming better-off to getting stronger.\n'
            "Due to its difference from western political systems, China's "
            'socialist road has drawn misunderstanding and skepticism over the '
            'past decades. A number of so-called China-watchers have long '
            'predicted a pessimistic future for China, and the theory of a '
            '"China collapse" has never ceased.\n'
            "But the truth is that China's development rate has surpassed many "
            'major economies in the world. The CPC as the leading party of the '
            "country is getting stronger. The country's circle of friends in "
            'the international community is expanding.\n'
            'In China, political legitimacy is built on competence and '
            'experience. Practice has proven that socialism with Chinese '
            'characteristics is the best way to ensure the fundamental '
            'interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people.\n'
            "Now China's development stands at a new historical starting "
            'point. Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new '
            'development stage.\n'
            'But this does not mean the CPC will rest on its laurels. The '
            'country still faces many daunting challenges, ranging from '
            'corruption to poverty and pollution.\n'
            'During his speech, Xi called on officials to enhance crisis '
            'consciousness and be ready for risks and challenges.\n'
            'He has warned the Party against being self-satisfied and blindly '
            'optimistic.\n'
            "The CPC clearly understands that the people's desire for a "
            'happier life is stronger than ever. They want better education, '
            'higher incomes, stable jobs, reliable social insurance, higher '
            'quality medical services, more comfortable living conditions, a '
            'more beautiful environment and a richer cultural life.\n'
            'Based on the will of the people, the CPC will firmly put forward '
            'new strategies and measures to gain the initiative in a rapidly '
            'changing era.\n'
            'At present, the major task for the CPC is to lead the country to '
            'accomplish the goal of building a moderately prosperous society '
            'by 2020.\n'
            'After 2020, China will strive to become a modernized socialist '
            "country by 2049, the centenary of the People's Republic of "
            'China.\n'
            "This is the CPC's solemn promise to the people. And that promise "
            'must be kept, as it has been over the past decades.\n'
            'Socialism with Chinese characteristics will prove that it does '
            'not only withstand the test of history, but also expands the '
            'pathway to modernization for developing countries, thus providing '

            'equipment in active service, with over 1,000 photos and 1,300 '
            'relics and other items on display.\n'

            'REWINDING OLD MEMORIES\n'
            'For some older visitors, the exhibits mean much more than just '
            'pictures.\n'
            '"The exhibition reminds me of the old times," said Liu Zhirong, '
            "an 85-year-old veteran from China's eastern city of Nanjing, who "
            'played his part in the War of Liberation (1945-1949) and the War '
            'to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953).\n'
            '"I remember the time when we all thought the War of Liberation '
            'would take another eight years, but were thrilled to see it end '
            'early," he said.\n'
            'As a scout back in the day, Liu can recall his duties thanks to '
            'the display of military technology.\n'
            '"I could only resort to my senses, memories and drawings for '
            "collecting information back then. I'm deeply impressed with all "
            'the modern weaponry on display," Liu said.\n'
            "Liu's sentiments were echoed by Zhao Zhansheng, the son of Zhao "
            "Yimin, a former major officer of northeast China's united forces "
            'against Japanese aggression.\n'
            '"I took a lot of pictures of the better preserved relics," said '
            'Zhao Zhansheng, 78, with a camera on his neck. "The exhibition is '

            'Party."\n'
            'EDIFYING YOUNG GENERATION\n'
            'For younger visitors, the exhibition is more about raising '
            'interest and nurturing their hobbies.\n'
            '"The armors and weapons appeal to me a lot," said Huang Jingkai, '
            'a 12-year-old from Xiamen City, who urged his father to take him '
            'to see the exhibition.\n'
            '"He has repeatedly expressed his eagerness to the military museum '
            'for a long while," his father said.\n'
            'It was the same for a group of 42 children at kindergartens or '
            'primary schools, who are the children of police officers in '
            'Beijing.\n'
            '"They are particularly interested in the weapons on exhibition," '
            'said a teacher surnamed Nian in charge of the group.\n'
            'The weapons were used by generations of PLA soldiers over 90 '
            'years, including self-made pistols during the War of Liberation, '
            'a model of a cannon that killed a major Japanese officer and '
            'others.\n'
            '"The visit is a part of our summer camp," he added. "We want them '
            'to go through patriotic education at a young age."\n'
            'A STRONGER ARMY\n'
            '"It\'s an army of might and civilization," wrote a visitor named '
            'Yuan Xing at the exit of the museum, where visitors can take a '
            'seat and write down their views of the exhibition and the PLA.\n'
            '"People are very keen on taking the time to drop some words," a '
            'museum employee said.\n'
            '"It\'s a genuine education in patriotism, which I\'ll keep in '
            'mind for a very long time," wrote another visitor.\n'
            'As for Liu Zhirong, with the PLA 90th anniversary drawing near, '

 'content': 'A week after its debut, the Chinese action film “Wolf Warriors 2” '
            'has won hearts not only in China but all around the world, a '
            'remarkable achievement for Chinese domestic films which have been '
            'long criticized for lagging behind international blockbusters.\n'
            'The film is the top grossing film at the Chinese box office, '
            'raking in about 987 million yuan (about $147 million) in the week '
            'ending July 30, Xinhua reported.\n'
            'The global revenue of Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk” was $73 '
            'million as of July 30. The huge gap has naturally made “Wolf '
            'Warriors 2” the top movie, according to US entertainment trade '
            'magazine Variety.\n'
            '“Wolf Warriors 2” received a score of 7.5 out of 10 on the '
            'Chinese media review site Douban.com and the Internet Movie '
            'Database. On Rotten Tomatoes, some 91 percent said they liked the '
            'film.\n'
            'Directed by and starring professional martial artist Wu Jing, the '
            'film features a retired Chinese special forces soldier and tells '
            'the story of how the soldier completes his rescue mission against '
            'mercenaries in an unidentified African country during civil war, '
            'as Chinese military vessels were sent to evacuate Chinese '
            'nationals. The international cast also includes Frank Grillo and '
            'Celina Jade.\n'
            'While many Chinese were inspired by the patriotism and bravery of '
            'the Chinese soldier during the mission, international audiences '
            'gave more credit to the story, the scenes, and the cast—and '
            'especially Wu. Some compared the film to “Jason Bourne.”\n'
            '“The film’s biggest draw, of course, is Chinese action-superstar '
            'Wu Jing. As a trained martial artist he has the physicality of '
            'Donnie Yen and the on screen charisma of Jet Li. Most '
            "importantly, Wu plays the kind of action hero that's just all too "
            'rare these days, the one that takes just as much punishment as he '
            'dishes it. Yet he sells it with the kind of world-class '
            'commitment that is simply awe-inspiring, like Jackie Chan or Tom '
            'Cruise who repeatedly endanger themselves simply to entertain '
            "their audience. It's all rather impressive until you realize he "
            'also directed the movie,” commented a user on Internet Movie '

            "country's most popular section of the Great Wall outside "
            'Beijing.\n'
            'The Badaling Terminal, schemed to open by the end of 2019, will '
            'occupy 36,000 square meters. The gigantic labyrinth, some 100 '
            'meters underground, is the deepest and largest high-speed train '
            'station in the world.\n'
            'The tunnel spans 12.01 kilometers from Beijing’s Changping '
            'District to Yanqing District and is an important section of the '
            'Beijing-Zhangjiakou High-Speed Railway. The tunnel ranges from '
            'four to 432 meters underground.\n'
            'Chinese engineers used small explosions to dig the tunnel. The '
            'controlled explosions reduce the impact so as to protect the '
            'Great Wall and carve out tunnel.\n'
            "The underground construction is the country's most complicated, "
            'because the station has to contain 78 caverns and lots of '
            'intersections, said Chen Bin, a commander-in-chief of the '
            'project.\n'
            'The Great Wall at Badaling\n'
            'According to an initial plan, workers could excavate the tunnel 6 '
            'to 8 meters a day, but the tough rock meant they could dig only '
            'about 2 meters a day.\n'
            'Another problem in the tunneling is the underground water. Every '
            'day, workers have to pump out no less than 19,000 cubic meters of '
            'water, which equals about 10 swimming pools.\n'
            'An estimated 4,500 controlled explosions have been carried out, '
            'according to a construction worker surnamed Zhang. Zhang said he '
            'once stood on the Great Wall and did not feel the force of the '
            'explosion.\n'
            'The underground station will have three floors and separate '
            'levels for arriving and departing passengers. Two escalators with '
            'vertical heights of 62 meters, the highest in the country, will '
            'also be installed in the station.\n'

            'project for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.',

            'beef brands have stimulated their Chinese rivals to upgrade '
            'industry and pursue technological progress.\n'
            'U.S. products entered China’s market last month as the country '
            'resumed beef imports, allowing them to be sold for between 100 '
            'yuan ($15) and 300 yuan per kilogram for now.\n'
            'Beijing consumers think the imported beef is a little bit '
            'expensive, but it is ok to consume occasionally. Domestic beef is '
            'generally priced at 70 to 90 yuan per kilogram.\n'
            'A spokesperson for Wumart, a leading retailer in Beijing, said '
            'the first batch of beef products transported by air was aimed at '
            'medium and high-end markets; promising a 50-per cent price '
            'reduction in future deliveries by sea.\n'
            'Foreign beef sold in China is mainly from Australia, Uruguay and '
            'New Zealand, with a total import volume of 825,000 tons in 2016.\n'
            'Data indicates that U.S. beef entry into China will effect '
            'changes to the domestic consumer market and pose challenges to '
            'the production and sale of local beef.\n'
            'According to beef feedlot owners in Heilongjiang, northeast '
            'China, beef price has dropped by 5 percent in five straight '
            'months.\n'
            'A beef broker, Han Baogang, thinks the price drop is mainly '
            'because of seasonal demand and the fall in prices of pork and '
            'poultry.\n'
            'Industry insiders say though the impact of U.S. beef will not be '
            'evident in the short term, the shortcomings of small-scale '
            'livestock farming in China should not be overlooked.\n'
            'Poor management creates low profits and such situation is '
            'vulnerable to risks, says an animal husbandry and veterinary '
            'service official from Longjiang County, Heilongjiang.\n'
            'Some feedlots in Heilongjiang province have begun taking measures '
            'to raise efficiency and reduce costs such as introducing beef '
            'cattle from New Zealand and Australia to produce crossbreeds. The '
            'high-end beef produced via this practice is sold at over 400 yuan '

            'University. She fell in love with China because of the kindness, '

            'calligraphy and water-ink paintings. They always relieve pressure '
            'and help me feel calm and relaxed," said Wang. He considers '
            'Beijing a paradise for "exhibitions" and has left footprints in '
            'many art places, including the National Art Museum of China and '

            'being alone in a foreign country. "I had many troubles at that '

            '(CMC), during a speech at a ceremony to mark the 90th anniversary '
            "of the People's Liberation Army (PLA).\n"
            "While hailing the PLA's great achievements over the nine decades, "
            'Xi said the Chinese military has reshaped its political '
            'environment, organizational form, system of military strength and '
            'work style over the past five years.\n'
            "The PLA should firmly safeguard the CPC's leadership and the "

            'development interests as well as regional and world peace, Xi '
            'told senior officials and military personnel gathered at the '
            'Great Hall of the People in Beijing.\n'
            '"The Chinese people love peace. We will never seek aggression or '

            "Zhurihe military training base in north China's Inner Mongolia "
            'Autonomous Region.\n'
            '"Today, we are closer to the goal of the great rejuvenation of '
            'the Chinese nation than any other time in history, and we need to '
            "build a strong people's military now more than any other time in "
            'history," Xi said in Sunday\'s speech.\n'
            'GLORY & TRADITION\n'
            'The PLA has come a long way since its birth at the Nanchang '
            'Uprising on August 1, 1927. Today, the PLA commands about two '
            'million service personnel.\n'
            "Xi told Tuesday's gathering that the armed forces had transformed "
            'from a "millet plus rifles" single-service force, one with only '
            'the most basic of supplies and equipment required to survive, '
            'into one that has fully-fledged services. The PLA has basically '
            'completed mechanization and is moving rapidly toward "strong" '
            'informationized armed forces, he said.\n'
            "Xi attributed the PLA's success to its glorious traditions and "
            'fine conduct under the leadership of the CPC.\n'
            '"The armed forces must follow the banner, the direction and the '
            'will of the Party at all times and under any circumstances." Xi '
            'noted, saying that the principle is an irreversible truth that '
            'the CPC has attained in struggles of blood and fire.\n'
            "Behind the PLA's glorious victories are also ideals and beliefs, "
            'as well as the reform determination, Xi said.\n'
            '"Only by continuous reform and innovation, can the people\'s army '
            'constantly gain development vitality and put itself in an '
            'impregnable position," Xi said.\n'
            'The PLA must be bold in reform and adept in innovation while '
            'staying away from rigidity and stagnation, he said.\n'
            'The president also stressed the role of fighting spirit, '
            'revolutionary discipline and civilian-military unity in claiming '
            'victories.\n'
            'As long as the armed forces stand with and win the support of the '
            'people, a "wall of iron" can be fortified, Xi said.\n'
            'RESHAPED PLA\n'
            'Since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the Party has put '
            'forward the goal of building a strong military that follows the '
            'Party, fights to win and forges exemplary conduct, Xi said.\n'
            'The Party has strengthened political work within the armed forces '
            'and made firm efforts to ensure a clean environment and fight '
            'corruption in the military, according to Xi.\n'
            'A series of major structural reforms have been made in recent '
            'years, including the establishment of the PLA Army General '
            'Command, the PLA Rocket Force and the PLA Strategic Support '
            'Force.\n'
            'The four general departments were reorganized into 15 agencies of '
            'the CMC, and five theater commands have replaced the seven '
            'military area commands. The CMC has taken charge of the overall '
            'military administration, while theater commands focus on '
            'operations and different services on troop developments.\n'
            '"The system, structure, pattern and image of the people\'s '
            'military have all been renewed," Xi said.\n'
            'Moreover, Xi said the fundamental changes have taken place in the '
            'governance of the military. Putting combat effectiveness as the '
            '"sole and fundamental" standard for the military, the PLA remains '
            "resolved in safeguarding the country's territorial sovereignty "
            'and maritime rights and interests.\n'
            'PARTY LEADERSHIP\n'
            "Xi reaffirmed the CPC's absolute leadership over the PLA. which "
            'is a "fundamental guarantee" for the army to maintain its great '
            'cohesion, creativity and combat capabilities.\n'
            "Quoting Mao Zedong, the founder of the People's Republic of "
            'China, Xi said: "Our principle is the Party commands the guns, '
            'and we will never allow the guns to command the Party."\n'
            'He ordered the PLA to always follow the command of the CPC '
            'Central Committee and the CMC."There shall be no wavering, no '
            'hesitation, and no ambiguity."\n'
            'The CPC has put forward a series of new ideas and requirements '
            'concerning national defense and military building in the past '
            'five years.These theories should be constantly enriched and '
            'developed to cope with new challenges and solve new problems, he '
            'said.\n'
            'FIGHT TO WIN\n'
            'Xi urged the PLA to focus on war preparedness to forge an elite '
            'and powerful force that is always "ready for the fight, capable '
            'of combat and sure to win."\n'
            '"All thoughts must be put on combat, and all work should focus on '
            'combat so the military can assemble, charge forward and win wars '
            'any time the Party and the people need them to," he said.\n'
            'Xi called for a new generation of "capable, brave and virtuous" '
            'service personnel "with soul."\n'
            'The PLA must have ironclad faith, beliefs, discipline and '
            "responsibility, and retain its nature and goal as the people's "

            'After DPRK’s recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, U.S. '
            'President Donald Trump took to social media to complain that '
            'China is doing nothing to help although China can “easily solve '
            'this problem.” Trump believes the “greatest immediate threat” to '
            'the U.S. is North Korea and that China can “easily solve this '
            'problem,” but the real question might be why North Korea feels '
            'the need to arm itself to the teeth.\n'
            'In a commentary by the state-run North Korean government '
            'newspaper Minju Choson, North Korea accused the U.S. of '
            'developing an “insect-size micro robot weapon” to be used for a '
            '“beheading operation” against the regime. Although the '
            'newspaper’s claim cannot be independently verified, it is no '
            'secret at least some in the U.S. government desire to destroy the '
            'country, as U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham reminded the world on NBC '
            'News. “There is a military option to destroy North Korea’s '
            'program and North Korea itself.”\n'
            'North Korea’s recent claim is, of course, one of many, but the '
            'overarching theme remains the same: In the eyes of North Korea, '
            'at least according to its media, the U.S. is determined to pursue '
            'military action against the country. It should be no surprise '
            'then that North Korea feels insecure, and this has led to a '
            'vicious cycle.\n'
            'The case can be made that North Korean nuclear weapons are the '
            'only reliable deterrent to American aggression. In North Korea, '
            'they have an interesting children’s story about a peaceful '
            'community that feels threatened by a ruthless tiger. The story '
            'ends on a happy note, at least for North Korea, with the tiger '
            'running off with its tail between its legs after a brave '
            'porcupine steps up to accept the challenge. The underlying '
            'meaning is simple: The ultimate thing keeping the U.S. from '
            'ripping the country to pieces is its nuclear deterrent.\n'
            'U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. does not seek '
            'regime change in North Korea and would like to sit down and have '
            'dialogue about the future. But obviously, such statements are not '
            'credible to North Korea and do nothing to end the vicious cycle.\n'
            'The solution to the dilemma is to not aggravate the explosive '
            'situation. Venting frustration over the failure of U.S. foreign '
            'policy; threatening economic coercion against China; and '
            'threatening the security of North Korea are only adding fuel to '
            'the fire. If the U.S. sincerely hopes China will help the U.S. '
            'solve its conflict with North Korea, then it should take '
            'seriously China’s “dual-track” approach and '
            '“suspension-for-suspension” proposal, which calls on North Korea '
            'to suspend its missile and nuclear activities in exchange for a '
            'less aggressive U.S. military posture, to help break out of the '
            'security dilemma and launch meaningful talks.\n'
            'While China certainly has an important role to play in helping '
            'the two sides avoid a head-on collision, it is ridiculous to '
            'assume China has control over North Korea or is responsible for '
            'solving America’s security problem. Saying China can easily solve '
            'the problem is like saying peace in the Middle East is “not as '
            'difficult as people have thought”; and the so-called “China '
            'responsibility theory” is based on a poor understanding of the '
            'nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, as well as baseless '
            'efforts to shift responsibility for the complicated problem onto '
            'China and others.\n'
            'If the U.S. aim is to promote peace and stability on the Korean '
            'Peninsula, then the region would be best served through '
            'collective efforts to create a situation in which the best '
            'formula for survival is not nuclear or other forms of hard power. '
            'But one thing is for certain: China is not to blame for North '
            'Korea’s missile and nuclear ambitions. As China has repeated over '
            'and over again, it is the U.S. and North Korea that hold the key '

            'Found in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Kubuqi desert is '
            'China’s 7th largest, covering over 18,000 kilometres. When China '
            'began its reform and opening up thirty seven years ago, Kubuqi '
            'was a poor, dry, hot and extremely cold (during winter) land with '
            'very few prospects. Only the most stubborn Mongolian herders '
            'stayed. Many were quick to escape the biting poverty and '
            'hopelessness by traveling south to Beijing or southeast to '
            'Jiangsu, Guangdong or Fujian, provinces that were urbanising and '
            'industrialising expeditiously.\n'
            'Tackle desertification, tackle poverty\n'
            'Twenty years ago, Hanggin Banner, located north of Ordos city was '
            'mostly sand, sheep and dust. The ethnic Mongol herders were '
            'trapped by the Kubuqi desert; there was little access in and out '
            'of Hanggin Banner. Winter brought disease and death. Summer came '
            'with heat waves and dust. With direction from the central '
            'government, the regional government worked with a private firm, '
            'Elion Resources Group, to counter desertification, promote '
            'sustainable development and to deliver economic development and '
            'better standards of living.\n'
            'In 2000, an ambitious effort to turn the desert green started. '
            'Today, 6,000 sq. km have been greened. The people here call it a '
            'miracle. But this is also a testament to the determination of the '
            'Communist Party of china to rid China of poverty and inequality.\n'

            'Xi’s portrait hangs above them. (Ronald Kato)\n'
            'Xi’s vision, China’s path\n'
            'In January of 2014, just days to lunar new year celebrations, Xi '
            'visited the snow battered Inner Mongolia. It is mostly cold here '
            'in January. The average temperature ranges from -23°C (-9.4°F) in '
            'the northeastern part of the Region to -10°C (14°F) in the '
            'southwestern part. He asked the regional government to accelerate '
            'industrialization and the poverty fight. "The fundamental purpose '
            'of the party is to serve the people," he said. His guidance led '
            'the CPC Inner Mongolia committee and the regional government to '
            'devise a new development concept premised on four pillars; '
            'sustainable development, restructuring, coordinated development '
            'and harmonious growth.\n'
            'Xi has made eradicating poverty the most important agenda of his '
            'presidency and ultimately the biggest goal of the party. He has '
            'visited over 30 impoverished villages in 28 provinces, '
            'municipalities and autonomous regions across the country since '
            'the 18th CPC National Congress in November 2012, getting '
            'firsthand information on the situation of poor people and '
            'encouraging them to shake off poverty in various ways. "I care '
            'about the poor the most," he said in his New Year address on '
            'December 31st 2016.\n'
            'While legitimacy in western style democracies comes from '
            'elections, the CPC’s legitimacy is derived from determination to '
            'build a just and equal Chinese society. In the eyes of the '
            'average Chinese, Chinese socialism is the perfect embodiment of '
            'democracy and the Communist Party means liberation from '
            'backwardness, disease and poverty.\n'
            '"A lot has changed here, the desert is a much better place to '
            'live today," Babu says. According to Babu, Xi is the champion and '
            'the party is the engine.\n'
            'There may not have a contest pitting the Communist Party of china '
            'against others since the founding of the Peoples Republic of '
            'China. But even if there was one, the Chinese would most '
            'certainly choose defeating poverty and inequality as opposed to '
            'untested promises of democracy and freedom.\n'
            'More than 700 million Chinese have been lifted out of poverty '
            'since the start of China’s reform and opening-up in 1978. China’s '
            '13th 5-year development plan expires in three years. The plan is '
            'to have lifted every Chinese out of poverty by then. About 30 '
            'million are considered to be still poor.\n'
            'Champion of rural reform\n'
            '"Where does a leader’s credibility come from? It does not come '
            'from relying on higher authorities, exerting power or using '
            'gimmicks. It is only built gradually by working for the people '
            'wholeheartedly, with dedication and perseverance. A leader must '
            'be proficient."\n'
            'That Xi has made fighting poverty top of his agenda is good news. '
            'But poverty eradication has been Xi’s top mission his entire '
            'life. His first experience with poverty came nearly 50 years ago '
            'when he was sent to work in a remote village in Shaanxi province '
            "as a result of Chairman Mao Zedong's campaign for urban youth to "
            'experience rural labor.\n'
            'He led the villagers in digging wells, building terraces and '
            'sediment storage dams. As secretary of the CPC Zhengding county '
            'committee in Hebei province between 1982-1985, Xi initiated '
            'robust reforms to get farmers harvesting more from the grain and '
            'vegetable fields. The reforms were a big success. Xi had struck '
            'the code to help peasants shake off poverty.\n'
            '1989: Xi Jinping, then-secretary of the CPC Ningde Prefectural '
            'Committee of Fujian province, leads party cadres to help clear a '
            'local canal. (Xinhua)\n'
            'In one of his speeches as deputy secretary of the CPC Fujian '
            'provincial central committee in 1989-now summarized in a book "Up '
            'and Out of Poverty," Xi stressed the importance of party leaders '
            'maintaining close ties with the people.\n'
            'He asked, "Where does a leader’s credibility come from? It does '
            'not come from relying on higher authorities, exerting power or '
            'using gimmicks. It is only built gradually by working for the '
            'people wholeheartedly, with dedication and perseverance. A leader '
            'must be proficient."\n'
            '"We are a socialist country. Having taken the first steps to '
            'prosper, the coastal regions in the east should not leave other '
            'areas alone. We need to achieve common prosperity," he said in '
            'another speech.\n'
            'Xi’s poverty eradication credentials are bolstered by his '
            'intolerance to corruption. In a 1990 speech in Fujian, he '
            'stressed that clean government was the historical mission of '
            'communists.\n'
            'He said "No matter how great or small the power of us Party '
            'members, it is given to us by the people. We can only follow the '
            'will of the people and work for their interests. In building a '
            'clean government, we must also be worthy of the honorable name of '
            'communists."\n'
            'While China is still not entirely corruption free, Xi’s fight is '
            'keeping the Party legitimate in the eyes of the Chinese public.\n'
            'Africa and the tragedy of elections\n'
            'About five African countries head to the polls this year - most '
            'though to honor a routine as opposed to ushering democratic, '
            'legitimate governments. In Angola, Eduardo dos Santos will not be '
            "on the ballot but his party, The People's Movement for the "
            'Liberation of Angola, is expected to maintain its firm grip on '
            'power in the oil rich country. Rwanda will most certainly '
            'maintain the status quo when it votes in June, giving Paul '
            'Kagame, in power since 2000, another seven years. In Kenya, '
            'President Uhuru is seeking a second term in office. The biggest '
            'accomplishment of his first term has been the $3.4bn standard '
            'gauge railway project, which was inaugurated in May.\n'
            'Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto’s legitimacy questions need '
            'no emphasis. The International Criminal Court (ICC) charged them '
            'for crimes against humanity. Those charges were later suspended '
            'following a spate of witness murders, disappearances and failure '
            'to cooperate on the part of the Kenyan government.\n'
            'While elections are a good measure of democracy, they have '
            'delivered quite the opposite in many African countries. They are '
            'often used by repressive regimes to beat ordinary citizens into '
            'fear while the opposition is allowed limited space to organize '
            'and campaign.\n'
            'They are also used to entrench one man/party rule and often '
            'result in constitutional changes meant to stifle civil liberties, '
            'a free press and political activism.\n'
            'While the leaders of most of Africa’s republics today are in '
            'power courtesy of elections, most if not all would actually not '
            'qualify even as prefectural secretaries of the Communist Party of '
            'china. Some of them are ideologically empty, morally corrupt and '
            'politically incompetent. I will, on another day, write about how '
            'one becomes a Communist Party of china cadre.\n'
            'They admire China and often liken their own parties to the CPC '
            'and its vision. Some even reference China’s leaders in their '
            'speeches. The difference is theirs are devoid of ideology, '
            'credibility, and truth.\n'
            'Their rise to power is only legitimized by the gun and patronage '
            'and for those with a bit time to feature on a ballot paper - by '
            'regional and continental blocks such as the East African and the '
            'African Union and sometimes by lazy observer missions led, many '
            'times, by their corrupt peers who were unlucky or unwilling to '
            'extend their own rule.\n'
            'As a result, many face low public approval ratings. Citizens '
            'perceive their governments and state institutions as repressive '
            'and corrupt-only designed to serve the interests of their '
            'rulers.\n'
            'Transformed desert\n'
            'Opening up Inner Mongolia through building infrastructure is a '
            'conviction held by the CPC. Infrastructure would be central to '
            'unlocking the potential of Inner Mongolia and opportunities for '
            'the region’s people who have long depended on herding.\n'
            'The region now boasts of 190,000 km of roads and a railway '
            'mileage of 13,700 km. There are also 21 airports .The '
            'infrastructure is used to move trade north into Mongolia and '
            'Russia, and east into North Korea. The region has also '
            'successfully diversified from herding to becoming a clean energy '
            'champion.\n'

            'A few kilometers out of Hanggin Banner, a 1,000MW solar plant has '

            'With the guidance of the Party, Inner Mongolia has successfully '
            'diversified from a herding region to become a clean energy hub, a '

            '11,000 ($1,594) for their rural counterparts. In 2016, the '

            'The Beijing TV dramas and movies broadcasting season in Africa, '
            'the fourth time it is being launched on the continent and first '
            'time in Zambia, will see eight hit television dramas and movies '
            'being broadcast to the Zambian audience.\n'
            'StarTimes, with branches in 35 African nations and with almost 10 '
            'million subscribers, has partnered with the Beijing Municipal '
            'Bureau of Press, Radio, Film and Television to broadcast the '
            'series.\n'
            'Guo Ziqi, StarTimes Vice-President said during the launch on '
            'Monday that the broadcasting of the series will contribute to the '
            'strengthened friendship between Zambia and China.\n'
            '"To assist the broadcasting season, we held the "Carnival of '
            'Films and TV drama" in 12 main villages around four major cities, '
            'Lusaka, Ndola, Kabwe and Kitwe and 24 movies were screened which '
            'received a lot of appreciation," she said.\n'
            'The television firm, she said, was the fastest growing digital '
            'television operator in Africa since its launch in 2002.\n'
            'Wang Yefei, Deputy Director-General of Beijing Municipal Bureau '

            'municipality attaches great importance to the cultural exchanges '
            'between China and Africa and hoped that the series will help the '
            'African audience to get a panorama of China.\n'
            'According to him, the African audience will also enjoy 17 movies '
            'and 400 drama episodes during the course of the year in seven '
            'languages, among them, English, French, Portuguese, Swahili, '
            'Hausa, Yoruba and Luganda.\n'
            'Yang Youming, Chinese Ambassador to Zambia, said Chinese TV '

            'movies will be broadcasted on Zambian channels to enrich the '
            'cultural life of citizens.\n'
            'According to him, the people-to-people exchange had become an '
            'important aspect of cooperation and has resulted in increased '
            'exchanges in cultural, educational and sports areas.\n'
            'So far about 3,500 Zambian students are studying in China while '

            'racist moments like ignoring two little Asian girls who support '
            'him are upsetting many Chinese.\n'
            'The President, who blasted the Affordable Care Act, also known as '
            'Obamacare, at the White House on July 24, met with families who '
            'described themselves as “victims of Obamacare” before his speech. '
            'A live video broadcasted by ABC News showed the president bending '
            'down to shake the hand of a white boy and then going directly to '
            'another white boy on the other side—bypassing two Asian girls '
            'standing in the middle, the only non-white representatives at the '
            'scene.\n'
            'Though U.S. mainstream media has largely ignored the incident, '
            'some eagle-eyed Chinese have posted the video online, calling '
            'Trump a racist. As of press time, around 7,000 netizens have '

            'president had no intention to shake hands with anyone, but the '

            'India Today, one of India’s most circulated English-language '
            'magazines, unveiled the cover of its latest issue on July 21, in '
            'which it depicted a red chicken representing China, whose tail '
            'and a leg are carved away. A green chick in the shape of Pakistan '
            'is also illustrated and dubbed “China’s new chick.” The latest '
            'issue also published an article criticizing China for building '
            'the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, adding that the move is '
            'meant for a “takeover of Pakistan by China.”\n'
            'In response to the provoking illustration, Lu Kang, the '
            'spokesperson of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, refused to '

            'are up in arms about all this. As of press time, some 10,000 '
            'netizens participated in a heated online discussion over the '
            'issue, with many ridiculing India for being “childish” and '

            'India to a daydream of separating China” in a commentary on July '
            '27, adding that the “despicable cover” is consoling India with '

            'pride for the country in recent years. The self-propelled '
            'cutter-suction dredger, Tianjing or Sky Whale, is one good '
            'example.\n'
            'The vessel is the largest cutter-suction dredger in Asia. '
            'Financed by Tianjin Waterway Bureau Limited under China '
            'Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC), the dredger is '
            'co-designed by Shanghai Jiaotong University and German company, '
            'VOSTALMG. It was built by China Merchants Heavy Industry '
            '(Shenzhen) Company Ltd.\n'
            'Surrounded by steel frames and crane arms, the vessel’s deck is '
            'more like a construction site. The only thing that distinguishes '
            'it from a real construction site is its clean environment. People '
            'on the vessel are required to put on safety helmets once they '
            'step out of the cabin.\n'
            'China has a long history of dredging, though modern technology '
            'has since replaced human labor.\n'
            'Tianjing has been hailed as a mighty tool for island-building '
            'because of its strong excavation and hydraulic reclamation '
            'ability. According to a crew member, Tianjing can excavate 4,500 '
            'cubic meters of mixture from the seabed each hour - the '
            'equivalence of a 0.5-meter-deep pit and a standard soccer field '
            'size.\n'
            'The reamer of Tianjing\n'
            'Cuts rocks as easy as mud!\n'
            'The vessel’s reamer has endowed it with powerful ability. The '
            'reamer is normally inconspicuous in pictures, but people will be '
            'astonished when standing right in front of it. The diameter of '
            'small reamers is 2.8 meters, while that of larger ones could '
            'reach 3.15 meters, said Wang Ming’an, former Tianjing captain and '
            'vice general manager of the Overseas Business Division of the '
            'CCCC Tianjin Waterway Bureau Limited.\n'
            'It was learned that the unit price of the cutter tooth on the '
            'reamer, which is used for excavation, is 1,500 RMB ($223). Driven '
            'by a 4,200-kilowatt variable-frequency motor, the cutter teeth '
            'could excavate moderately- and highly-weathered rocks with '
            'compression strength as high as 40 MPa.\n'
            '“Concretes can be easily ground by the reamer,” said Wang, adding '
            'that rocks are as soft as mud for the machine.\n'
            'Powerful self-propelling ability, automatic dredging control '
            'system\n'
            'In addition, the dredger has two other “killer skills”: powerful '
            'self-propelling ability and advanced automatic dredging control '
            'system. The cockpit located on the top floor of the vessel is the '
            '“brain” that realizes the two functions.\n'
            'Covering an area of about 40 or 50 square-meters, the cockpit '
            'offers a strong taste of high-tech style that can easily be '
            'associated with the flight deck of a spaceship in a sci-fi '
            'movie.\n'
            'The automatic dredging control system lies in the cockpit, '
            'integrating all operations in a 2-square meter station. The '
            'remote control is operated just by clicking the mouse or pushing '
            'the buttons. Crew members can even take a cup of tea while '
            'excavating, a staff on the vessel explained.\n'
            'Positioning and self-propelling systems are on the two sides of '
            'the dredging control station. The staff member said that '
            'cutter-suction dredgers are not new as they have been widely '
            'applied in engineering dredging projects.\n'
            'However, most of them are not equipped with self-propelling '
            'systems. They depend on other ships to mobilize to different work '
            'points. As Asia’s first self-propelled cutter-suction dredger, '
            'Tianjing can sail to any part of the ocean.\n'
            'The cockpit of Tianjing\n'
            'Export limitations\n'
            'On May 25, China’s Ministry of Commerce limited exports of '
            'large-scale engineering ships. Without government approval, '
            'exports of cutter-suction dredgers with reamer power equal to or '
            'larger than 500 kilowatts, excavation depth equal to or larger '
            'than 15 meters, and installed power equal to or larger than 2,000 '
            'kilowatts, are not allowed anymore.\n'
            'Wang said all CCCC Tianjin Waterway Bureau Limited vessels are '
            'subjected to the export limitations. He added that their vessels '
            'could work in foreign countries, but purchases are not allowed.\n'
            'According to Wang, when the dredger arrives at a construction '
            'site, a key pile with a diameter of 1.8 meters is then laid and a '
            'transverse axis arranged on both sides of the ship bow.\n'
            'An axle beam weighing 1,100 tons reaches out to press the cutter '
            'in case the latter rebounds after touching hard sand and rocks '
            'under the sea, Wang explained. Tianjing’s mud conveyance distance '
            'is 6,000 meters.\n'
            'Moves forward like walking in water\n'
            'Tianjing looks like a walking person in water as its main and '
            'supporting piles submerge in turns.\n'
            'Crew members do not feel bored as Tianjing is equipped with '
            'facilities such as dormitory, playroom, fitness room, laundry, '
            'medical room and canteen.\n'
            'The average age of the crew is 28 years old. Usually, these young '
            'people have to work 3 consecutive months before they are allowed '
            'to have vacation.\n'
            'How to keep the food and vegetables fresh is a challenge. Li '
            'Yuelai, Tianjing political commissioner and deputy Party '
            'secretary of the CCCC, said most vegetables were damaged by wind '
            'and storm after some time.\n'
            'Tianjing has made China’s dredging industry comparable to the '
            'world’s leading companies, said a CCCC staff. Before 2005, '
            'Chinese dredging companies largely relied on imported equipment '
            'and the country’s dredger-building technology was undeveloped as '
            'a result of foreign blockade.\n'
            'The able dredger has so far taken part in many hydraulic '
            'reclamation projects, Li said, emphasizing that Tianjing has '
            'attracted the attention of some foreign engineers.\n'
            'Besides Tianjing, China has also developed a more advanced '
            'self-propelled cutter-suction dredger named Tiankun. It has a '
            'designed production capacity of 6,000 cubic meters per hour and '
            'cutter efficiency of 5,000 kilowatts, a CCCC staff said.\n'
            'Capable of evacuating 35 meters in depth with maximum conveyance '
            'distance of 15,000 meters, Tiankun tops the world in terms of '
            'long-distance delivery capacity and other capabilities. The '
            'research and development of Tiankun has promoted the '
            'transformation of the country’s dredge-building technology from '
            '“Made in China” to “Created in China.”',

            'the area several awards.\n'
            'The architectural style in Three lanes, seven alleys stands out\n'
            '“Zhang Tian Fu was a wealthy man who lived here and died two '
            'months ago at the age of 108. He drank Chinese tea throughout his '

            'Kaiyuan temple, Jiuri mountain\n'
            'The Kaiyuan Buddhist monastery in Quanzhou took 10 years to '
            'construct 800 years ago. The strength of the architectural work '
            'was demonstrated 400 years ago when one of the pagodas (a '
            'watchtower-like structure) survived a very powerful earthquake. '
            'On two pillars inside the temple is the couplet: “This place '
            'enjoyed the reputation of a Buddhist county in ancient times. '
            'There were saints here and there in the streets.” The inscription '

            'Jiuri mountain on the other hand is 7 km from downtown Quanzhou. '
            'Kaiyuan temple and Jiuri mountain marked the takeoff point of the '
            'Maritime Silk Road. During the Song and Yuan dynasties '
            '(960-1368), Quanzhou witnessed dynamic maritime trade and '
            'communication with Asia and Africa. “Some 800 years ago, '

            'the press last week at the site.\n'
            '“The government and people of Quanzhou valued friendship with '
            'foreign guests. Each year before the ships set sail, local '
            'officials would hold grand ceremonies on Jiuri mountain to pray '
            'for favorable wind and good luck during their voyages, leaving '
            'behind lots of stone inscriptions,” reads the brochure issued by '
            'city authorities.\n'

            'Located 2 km off the coast of Xiamen city, Gulangyu island is '
            'home to about 20,000 people. Access to the little island covering '
            'about 2 square km is by ferry from Xiamen; then electric buggies '
            'on the paved narrow ring path round the islet. After the '
            'British-led Opium war against China in 1840, 13 nations, '
            'including Britain, France and Japan established consulates, '
            'churches and hospitals on Gulangyu, turning it into a joint '
            'concession.\n'
            'The islet only returned to Chinese control after Japan’s defeat '
            'in World War II. Only electric-powered vehicles are permitted on '
            'the island, so the environment is free from the noise and '
            'pollution of combustion engines. Breathing clean air, '
            'appreciating the ever-present green trees and lovely flowers, and '

            'pianos as residents are reputed to own more than 600 personal '

            'containing over 100 world-famous antique pianos collected from '

            'his death in 2013, he donated the musical instruments to the '

            'the Maritime Cooperation 2017 drills on July 25 in the Baltic '

            'Three Chinese Navy ships—the Hefei guided missile destroyer, the '
            'Yuncheng frigate, and the Luomahu supply ship—appeared in the '
            'Baltic Sea for the kick off the routine joint drills, becoming '
            'the first Chinese naval group to pay a visit to the Baltic Sea. '
            'The series of drills are expected to last until July 28, and will '
            'include anti-ship, anti-submarine, and anti-aircraft defense '
            'maneuvers. China and Russia have been holding the joint naval '
            'drills since 2012.\n'
            'Piers Cazalet, the acting spokesman for NATO, said that the naval '
            'drills in the Baltic Sea “are an example of China’s growing '
            'military capabilities and its increasingly significant global '
            'role,” The New York Times reported.\n'
            'The joint naval drills in the Baltic Sea are rattling the nerves '
            'of the Western powers. However, the Chinese government has made '
            'it clear that the drills are not aimed at any third party, which, '
            'by definition, includes NATO. In addition, China does not have a '
            'ruthless history of colonialism.\n'
            'But it is hard for the Western powers to shake off that old '
            'thinking of world domination. “The Baltic Sea is the heart of '
            'Europe. One can only imagine how uncomfortable the China-Russia '
            'military exercise is making them,” said Xiakedao, the WeChat '
            'account of the overseas edition of the People’s Daily.\n'
            'The West’s anxiety over the joint naval drills is evident from '
            'their “little tricks,” as noted by Xiakedao. The former world '
            'power dispatched its Royal Navy to shadow the high-tech Chinese '
            'armada through the English Channel on its way to join Russia’s '
            'fleet. This is routine business for the United Kingdom, but the '
            'Netherlands and Denmark also dispatched warships.\n'
            'NATO countries are worried about the growing strategic '
            'partnership between China and Russia and the joint naval '
            'exercises are being watched closely by NATO warships in the area. '
            'The U.S. European Command (EUCOM) said in a statement that the '
            'U.S. is “closely tracking Russian exercises with other '
            'participants, like China,” according to Stars and Stripes, a news '
            'organization that provides news and information to the U.S. '
            'military community.\n'
            'The hysteria is ridiculous. In total, about 10 ships, including '
            'the three Chinese warships, are taking part in the joint military '
            'exercises. In addition, it took the Chinese warships 40 days to '
            'reach the distant frontier, according to Russian news agency '
            'Sputnik. Compare that to the scale and frequency of NATO military '
            'exercises at Russia’s doorstep or the scale and frequency of U.S '
            'military exercises at China’s doorstep, and it is obvious that '
            'the naval drills are trivial in comparison. “There is no need for '
            'NATO to be so fragile,” said Xiakedao.\n'
            'Members of NATO ought to be extremely uneasy—but for very '
            'different reasons. U.S. President Donald Trump has called into '
            'question the “enduring purpose and nature” of the military and '
            'political organization and demanded members pay the U.S. for '
            '“protection,” which is problem for the European countries that '
            'are struggling with slow to no growth. Furthermore, the new '
            'administration is basically just sharpening the edge of former '
            'U.S. President Barack Obama’s failed “rebalance to Asia and the '
            'Pacific” policy by putting more emphasis on the military '
            'dimension. Clearly the U.S.’s “rock-solid” commitment to the '
            'alliance is in question.\n'
            'The truth of the matter regarding the joint naval drills is much '
            'more mundane. While China and Russia are forging closer military '
            'ties, they are not forming a formal military alliance to engage '
            'in expansion or to defend against the potential threat of '
            'aggression. China has been very clear that it has no intention to '
            'seek expansion. And although China is rising as the West '
            'declines, the country is focused on development and '
            'cooperation—and not world domination. As for Russia, the most '
            'important task is to build up the economy. What this all means, '
            'of course, is that routine military cooperation between China and '
            'Russia is not the next NATO.',

            'search engine in China, boomed recently, showing the wild '
            'imagination of Chinese web users.\n'
            'Have you ever wondered “if you hold in a fart, where does it go?” '
            'According to Baidu, it exits out the mouth and nose. When people '
            'hold in gas it will absorb into the intestinal wall and then mix '
            'with the blood. Then the gas comes out through the mouths—the '
            'higher end of the digestive track.\n'
            '“Why can’t I stop picking at acne?” raised the second biggest '
            'question mark. Baidu says the reason is obsessive-compulsive '
            'disorder. People with this mental disorder feel the need to '
            'repeatedly touch and squeeze their pimples until their anxiety is '
            'relieved by the repeated movements. This may also occur in people '
            'who are perfectionists or in those who are obsessed with their '
            'looks.\n'
            'According to the data, people from 20 to 40 years old are curious '
            'why their snoring doesn’t wake them up. According to Baidu, their '
            'brains ignore the information so they can have a good rest.\n'
            'Some wanted to know: “Will mosquitoes still bite if I put a bowl '
            'of blood next to my bed?” Baidu says yes, as the bowl of blood '
            'will cool down and mosquitoes are attracted to heat.\n'
            'There were also questions that Baidu was unable to answer, such '
            'as: “Why does my daughter look ugly?” According to Baidu’s data, '
            'Libras are most likely to search this question. Many users on the '
            'Chinese language collective intelligence community Baidu Knows '
            'comfort those who ask this question by saying “beauty is not '
            'everything” or “your daughter might be more beautiful when she '
            'blossoms into womanhood.”\n'
            'Baidu is the world’s largest Chinese search engine and the '
            'largest Chinese website, used by 95 percent of Chinese internet '

            'Abacus, also called Suan Pan in pinyin, is a handy calculation '
            'tool invented by ancient Chinese in the Northern Song Dynasty '
            '(960-1127). Constructed as a wooden frame with beads sliding on '
            'parallel rods, it is be able to help with basic calculations, '
            'such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and square roots. '
            'Mental abacus, an even quicker way to calculate by mentally '
            'visualizing an abacus, was incorporated into some math classes in '
            'China to improve students’ visual cognition and working memory '
            'since 1980s.\n'
            'In recent years, together with Chinese language courses, China’s '
            'courses on abacus culture and mental abacus have been popularized '
            'in many Western countries. Being introduced to America in 2010, '
            'mental abacus was announced as an official course at Barnard '
            'Elementary School, San Diego, U.S., with 110 pupils enrolled in 5 '
            'classes in 2016. To this day, dozens of elementary schools in San '
            'Diego have included mental abacus into their curriculum. “At '
            'first, I thought mental abacus was just simple math. But it '
            'turned out to be related to Chinese philosophy. We can feel the '
            'diversity of the world by learning it!” Monica, a student’s '
            'parent, told People’s Daily.\n'
            'Research has shown that mental abacus training is beneficial to '
            'young people’s coordination of senses, intellectual development, '
            'and mathematical cognition. According to Yang Chuanzhen, a '
            'Shandong-based scholar in regional culture, mental abacus is more '
            'than just a technique reflecting Chinese morals and wisdom. With '
            'its brain-training function, this ancient calculation method will '
            'continue to shine in classrooms at home and around the world, '
            'despite the lesser use of physical abacus in real life.\n'
            'It is worth noting that mental abacus is not the only Chinese '
            'mathematical wisdom borrowed by Western classrooms. The Chinese '
            'decimal multiplication table, which can assist people to memorize '
            'multiplication up to 9×9 with ease, was reportedly translated '
            'into English and taught in math classes in the United Kingdom in '
            '2015.',

            'Russia, Iran, DPRK\n'
            'The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly '
            'approved a bill that will slap tougher sanctions on Russia, Iran '
            "and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).\n"
            'Congressmen voted 419-3 to pass the bill, with three Republicans '
            '-- Justin Amash, Jimmy Duncan and Thomas Massie -- voting against '
            'the bill.\n'
            'Political analysts said the move will bring more uncertainties to '
            "the country's relations with the three countries.\n"
            '"The House\'s 419-3 vote on the sanctions bill reflects changes '
            'in its evaluation of threats from the three countries," said Teng '
            'Jianqun, director of the Department for American Studies at the '
            'China Institute of International Studies.\n'
            'Teng said the sanctions bill also shows that the United States '
            'now has great worries about its national security.\n'
            '"The bill, undoubtedly, will bring a negative impact and more '
            "uncertainties to America's relations with the three countries, as "
            'well as solutions to related regional issues," Teng added.\n'
            'The overwhelming support for the bill, which was voted on under '
            'special procedures to pass with a two-thirds majority, means that '
            'the House could override a presidential veto.\n'
            'The measure aims to target key Russian officials in retaliation '
            "for Moscow's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential "
            'election, as well as sanctions against Iran and the DPRK in '
            'response to their weapons programs.\n'
            '"These three regimes in different parts of the world are '
            'threatening vital U.S. interests, and they are destabilizing '
            'their neighbors," House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed '
            'Royce said Tuesday. "It is well past time that we forcefully '
            'respond."\n'
            'In addition to imposing new sanctions on the three countries, the '
            'bill also grants Congress the power to block U.S. President '
            'Donald Trump from lifting sanctions on Russia. This came despite '
            'that Trump administration officials had called on lawmakers to '
            'grant "flexibility" to the White House in dealing with Russia.\n'
            'According to the bill, Congress will have power to veto any '
            'decision made by the president that would "significantly alter" '
            'U.S. foreign policy in connection with Russia.\n'
            '"This strong oversight is necessary. It is appropriate. After '
            'all, it is Congress that the Constitution empowers to regulate '
            'commerce with foreign nations," Royce said, according to news '
            'website The Hill.\n'
            'The White House on Sunday signaled that Trump would accept the '
            'new legislation despite initial opposition.\n'
            '"We support where the legislation is now, and will continue to '
            'work with the House and Senate to put those tough sanctions in '
            'place on Russia," said newly appointed White House Press '
            'Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n'
            'Russian officials have repeatedly denied allegations of '
            'interfering in U.S. elections. The Kremlin has said that they '
            'viewed the U.S. sanctions bill "negatively."\n'
            '"Extremely negatively," Russian presidential press secretary '
            'Dmitry Peskov was quoted by Sputnik news agency as saying when '
            "asked about the Kremlin's take on the draft bill on Monday.\n"
            'The Kremlin also warned that fresh sanctions on Russia would '
            'adversely affect both sides, as well as interests of third '
            'countries.\n'
            '"We consider such a continuation of the rhetoric of sanctions '
